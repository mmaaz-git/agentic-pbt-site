The bug report has been saved to `bug_report_argcomplete_lexers_2025-08-18_21-22_s0e1.md`.\n\n**Testing Summary:**\n- Tested 30 different properties across multiple test files\n- Found 1 genuine bug related to whitespace handling\n- All other properties passed successfully, showing the module is generally robust",
