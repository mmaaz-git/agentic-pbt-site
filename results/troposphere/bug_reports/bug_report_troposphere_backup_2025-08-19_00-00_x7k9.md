# Bug Report: troposphere.backup validate_backup_selection Allows Invalid Configuration

**Target**: `troposphere.validators.backup.validate_backup_selection`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-08-19

## Summary

The `validate_backup_selection` function incorrectly allows both `ListOfTags` and `Resources` to be specified when they are CloudFormation `If` objects, violating the "exactly one" constraint.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from troposphere import If
from troposphere.backup import BackupSelectionResourceType

def test_backup_selection_exactly_one_with_if_objects():
    """BackupSelection should enforce exactly one of ListOfTags or Resources, even for If objects"""
    
    # Create If conditions
    condition1 = If("Condition1", [], [])
    condition2 = If("Condition2", ["arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*"], [])
    
    # This should fail but doesn't when both are If objects
    selection = BackupSelectionResourceType(
        IamRoleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/BackupRole",
        SelectionName="TestSelection",
        ListOfTags=condition1,
        Resources=condition2
    )
    
    # Should raise ValueError but doesn't
    selection.validate()  # BUG: No exception raised!
```

**Failing input**: Both `ListOfTags` and `Resources` specified as CloudFormation `If` objects

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/root/hypothesis-llm/envs/troposphere_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages')

from troposphere import If
from troposphere.backup import BackupSelectionResourceType

# Create If conditions
condition1 = If("UseTagSelection", [], [])
condition2 = If("UseResourceSelection", ["arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*"], [])

# This violates the "exactly one" requirement but doesn't raise an error
selection = BackupSelectionResourceType(
    IamRoleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/BackupRole",
    SelectionName="BuggySelection",
    ListOfTags=condition1,  # If object
    Resources=condition2     # If object
)

selection.validate()  # Should raise ValueError but doesn't
print("Bug confirmed: Both ListOfTags and Resources were accepted!")
```

## Why This Is A Bug

The `validate_backup_selection` function is documented to enforce that exactly one of `ListOfTags` or `Resources` must be specified. However, when both properties are CloudFormation `If` objects, the validation is incorrectly skipped. This allows invalid CloudFormation templates to be generated, which could fail at deployment time or create unexpected backup configurations.

The bug is in the logic that checks if both properties are `If` objects and returns early without validation, incorrectly assuming CloudFormation will handle it.

## Fix

```diff

+++ b/troposphere/validators/backup.py
@@ -31,14 +31,9 @@ def backup_vault_name(name):

-

-        return

     exactly_one(self.__class__.__name__, self.properties, conds)
```

Alternatively, if the intention is to allow CloudFormation to handle conditional logic, the check should ensure that the If objects are mutually exclusive through their conditions, not just skip validation entirely.
