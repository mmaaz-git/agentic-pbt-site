# Bug Report: troposphere.location Validation Method Inconsistency

**Target**: `troposphere.location.APIKey` and other AWS resource classes  
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Contract
**Date**: 2025-08-19

## Summary

The `validate()` method doesn't check for required fields, while `to_dict(validation=True)` does. This creates an inconsistency where objects that pass `validate()` can fail when converted to dict with validation enabled.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
import troposphere.location as location

@given(st.dictionaries(
    st.sampled_from(["Description", "ForceDelete", "ForceUpdate"]),
    st.one_of(st.text(), st.booleans())
))
def test_validate_consistency(optional_fields_only):
    """Test that validate() and to_dict(validation=True) have consistent behavior"""
    obj = location.APIKey.from_dict("TestKey", optional_fields_only)
    
    # If validate() passes, to_dict(validation=True) should also pass
    try:
        obj.validate()
        validation_passed = True
    except:
        validation_passed = False
    
    try:
        obj.to_dict(validation=True)
        to_dict_passed = True
    except:
        to_dict_passed = False
    
    assert validation_passed == to_dict_passed
```

**Failing input**: `{}`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import troposphere.location as location

obj = location.APIKey.from_dict("TestKey", {})

try:
    obj.validate()
    print("validate() passed - no error")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"validate() raised: {e}")

try:
    result = obj.to_dict(validation=True)
    print("to_dict(validation=True) passed")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"to_dict(validation=True) raised: {e}")
```

## Why This Is A Bug

The API contract implies that `validate()` should validate the object completely, but it only validates individual properties that are set, not the presence of required fields. Meanwhile, `to_dict(validation=True)` checks both property validity and required field presence. This inconsistency violates the principle of least surprise and can lead to objects that appear valid but fail during serialization.

## Fix

The `validate()` method should also check for required fields to maintain consistency with `to_dict(validation=True)`. This requires modifying the base class validation logic in troposphere to check the `props` dictionary for required fields (those with `True` as the second element in their tuple).
