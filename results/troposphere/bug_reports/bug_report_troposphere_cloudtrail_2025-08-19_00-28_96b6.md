# Bug Report: troposphere.cloudtrail Deferred Validation of Required Properties

**Target**: `troposphere.cloudtrail`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Contract
**Date**: 2025-08-19

## Summary

All AWS resource classes in troposphere.cloudtrail (and likely the entire troposphere library) fail to validate required properties at object creation time, deferring validation until `to_dict()` is called. This violates the fail-fast principle and can lead to late discovery of configuration errors.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
import troposphere.cloudtrail as cloudtrail

@given(
    location=st.text(min_size=1),
    dest_type=st.text(min_size=1),
    include_location=st.booleans(),
    include_type=st.booleans()
)
def test_destination_required_properties(location, dest_type, include_location, include_type):
    """Test that Destination enforces its required properties."""
    kwargs = {}
    if include_location:
        kwargs["Location"] = location
    if include_type:
        kwargs["Type"] = dest_type
    
    try:
        dest = cloudtrail.Destination(**kwargs)
        assert include_location and include_type, "Destination created without required properties"
    except ValueError:
        assert not (include_location and include_type), "Destination failed with all required properties"
```

**Failing input**: `include_location=False, include_type=False`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import troposphere.cloudtrail as cloudtrail

# Create Trail without required properties S3BucketName and IsLogging
trail = cloudtrail.Trail("MyTrail")
print("Trail created successfully without required properties!")

# Create Destination without required properties Location and Type  
dest = cloudtrail.Destination()
print("Destination created successfully without required properties!")

# Validation only happens when calling to_dict()
try:
    trail.to_dict()
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Validation deferred until to_dict(): {e}")
```

## Why This Is A Bug

This violates the fail-fast principle and AWS CloudFormation's documented requirements:

1. **Late error discovery**: Errors only surface when templates are generated, not when objects are created
2. **API contract violation**: AWS CloudFormation documentation clearly states these properties are required
3. **Developer experience**: Debugging is harder when errors occur far from the source
4. **Type safety**: Objects can exist in invalid states, making it impossible to rely on type checking

The troposphere library's own property definitions mark these as required (e.g., `"Location": (str, True)` where `True` indicates required), but this requirement is not enforced at object creation.

## Fix

```diff
--- a/troposphere/__init__.py
+++ b/troposphere/__init__.py
@@ -206,6 +206,10 @@ class BaseAWSObject:
         for k, v in kwargs.items():
             self.__setattr__(k, v)

+        if self.do_validation:
+            self._validate_props()
+
         self.add_to_template()
 
     def add_to_template(self) -> None:
```

This fix ensures required properties are validated at object creation time rather than deferring to `to_dict()`, providing immediate feedback to developers when they create invalid resources.
