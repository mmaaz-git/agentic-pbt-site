  "result": "After extensive property-based testing of `lxml.ElementInclude`, I found that while the module's handling of control characters in text includes may seem restrictive, it actually **correctly implements the XInclude specification**.\n\nThe XInclude spec explicitly states that \"Characters that are not permitted in XML documents also are a [fatal error]\" even when using `parse=\"text\"`. This means control characters (0x00-0x08, 0x0B-0x0C, 0x0E-0x1F) cannot be included, which limits the use of text includes for data formats that use these as delimiters.\n\nKey findings:\n- \u2705 Max depth limiting works correctly\n- \u2705 Recursive include detection works properly  \n- \u2705 URL joining for relative paths functions as expected\n- \u2705 Fallback validation correctly enforces parent-child relationships\n- \u2705 XML includes preserve content (with standard XML normalization like `\\r` \u2192 `\\n`)\n- \u2705 Control character rejection is **spec-compliant**, not a bug\n\nTested 8 properties on lxml.ElementInclude - all passed \u2705",
