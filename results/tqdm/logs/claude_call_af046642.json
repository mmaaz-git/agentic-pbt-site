This happens because the method directly calls `self._instances.remove(self)` without checking if the instance has already been removed, unlike the parent class which handles this safely.\n\n**Impact**: This causes exceptions during garbage collection and when `close()` is called multiple times, violating the expected behavior that cleanup methods should be safe to call repeatedly.\n\n**Bug report saved**: `bug_report_tqdm_gui_2025-08-18_19-52_rvwc.md`\n\nThe bug was discovered through property-based testing that verified the idempotency property that close() methods should have - a fundamental invariant for resource cleanup operations.",
