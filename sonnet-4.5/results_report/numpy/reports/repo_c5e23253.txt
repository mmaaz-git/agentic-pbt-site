Original array shape: (4, 4)
Non-contiguous view shape: (2, 2)
Non-contiguous view:
[[ 1  3]
 [ 9 11]]
Is input contiguous? False
Is input C-contiguous? False
Is input F-contiguous? False

Matrix created with copy=False:
Matrix:
[[ 1  3]
 [ 9 11]]
Is matrix contiguous? False
Is matrix C-contiguous? False
Is matrix F-contiguous? False

--- Logic Error Analysis ---
order = 'C'
bool(order) = True
If order='C': (order or arr.flags.contiguous) = True
Therefore: not (order or arr.flags.contiguous) = False
The condition is ALWAYS False, so line 167 (arr = arr.copy()) is NEVER executed!
