Testing addition associativity violation:
a = a
b = 0_8 (0 with kind=8)
c = 1 (1 with kind=4)

(a + 0_8) + 1_4 = 1 + a
a + (0_8 + 1_4) = 1_8 + a

Are they equal? False
Should be equal for associativity to hold: True

This violates the fundamental property of associativity: (a + b) + c == a + (b + c)
