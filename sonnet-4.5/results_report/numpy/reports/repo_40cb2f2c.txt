Warnings raised: 0

Calling __getattr__ directly (emits warning as intended):
Warnings raised: 1
Warning message: `NBitBase` is deprecated and will be removed from numpy.typing in the future. Use `@typing.overload` or a `TypeVar` with a scalar-type as upper bound, instead. (deprecated in NumPy 2.3)

Checking if NBitBase is in module __dict__:
'NBitBase' in npt.__dict__: True
