Testing busday_count antisymmetry property:
==================================================
Date 1 (Saturday): 2000-01-01
Date 2 (Monday): 2000-01-03

busday_count(Saturday, Monday) = 0
busday_count(Monday, Saturday) = -1

Antisymmetry property check:
Expected: count_forward = -count_backward
Expected: 0 = 1
Actual result: 0 != 1

Property violated: True

Additional test with Tuesday:
busday_count(Saturday, Tuesday) = 1
busday_count(Tuesday, Saturday) = -2
Expected: 1 = 2
Property violated: True
