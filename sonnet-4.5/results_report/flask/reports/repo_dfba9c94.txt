Error occurred: TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment

This happens because:
  1. FLASK_DATABASE='123' is processed first (alphabetically)
  2. It gets parsed as integer 123 via json.loads()
  3. config['DATABASE'] = 123 is set
  4. FLASK_DATABASE__HOST is processed next
  5. Code tries to set config['DATABASE']['HOST'] = 'localhost'
  6. But config['DATABASE'] is 123 (int), not a dict!
