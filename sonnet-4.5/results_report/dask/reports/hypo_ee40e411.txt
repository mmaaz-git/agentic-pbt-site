Running property-based test for key_split...
Testing that legitimate words are preserved in compound keys

âœ— Test failed!
Assertion error: key_split('task-feedback-1') returned 'task', expected 'task-feedback'

This demonstrates that key_split incorrectly strips legitimate English words
that happen to be 8 characters long and contain only letters a-f.
