Testing _adjust_split_out_for_group_keys with empty by list:
npartitions = 100
by = []
len(by) = 0

Result: -10

Step-by-step calculation:
len(by) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1
10 / (len(by) - 1) = 10 / -1 = -10.0
npartitions / denominator = 100 / -10.0 = -10.0
math.ceil(-10.0) = -10

Is result positive? False
Is result a valid number of partitions? False
