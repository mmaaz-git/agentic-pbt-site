Running property-based test for dask.bytes.read_bytes offset generation...
Testing invariant: offsets must be strictly increasing

Test failed with assertion error:
  Offsets not increasing at index 1: off=[1, 1], size=2, blocksize=1, not_zero=True

This demonstrates a bug where duplicate offsets are generated,
violating the fundamental assumption that file blocks don't overlap.
