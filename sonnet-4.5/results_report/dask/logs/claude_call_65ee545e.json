In line 60 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/io/orc/arrow.py`, the code uses `paths[0]` instead of `path`:\n\n```python\nfor path in paths:  # Line 58: Loop variable 'path' is defined\n    if schema is None:\n        with fs.open(paths[0], \"rb\") as f:  # Line 60: BUG - uses paths[0] instead of path\n            o = orc.ORCFile(f)\n            schema = o.schema\n    parts.append([(path, None)])\n```\n\nWhile this bug has minimal practical impact in typical usage (since the schema is only read once when `schema is None` on the first iteration, where `path` equals `paths[0]`), it represents poor code quality and could cause issues if the code logic changes in the future. The unused loop variable is a classic programming error that violates basic coding principles.\n\n## Relevant Context\n\nThe bug appears in the `else` branch (lines 57-63) that handles the case when `split_stripes=False`. This contrasts with the `if` branch (lines 36-56) for `split_stripes=True`, which correctly opens each file individually using the loop variable `path` on line 39.\n\nThe `split_stripes=False` mode is intended to create a 1-to-1 mapping between files and partitions according to the documentation. The current implementation assumes all files have the same schema and only reads it from the first file, which is likely an intentional optimization. However, the use of `paths[0]` instead of `path` is clearly a typo since it makes the loop variable unused.\n\nDocumentation link: The public API is exposed through `dask.dataframe.read_orc`, where `split_stripes=False` specifies a 1-to-1 mapping between files and partitions.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\n```diff\n--- a/dask/dataframe/io/orc/arrow.py\n+++ b/dask/dataframe/io/orc/arrow.py\n@@ -57,7 +57,7 @@ class ArrowORCEngine:\n         else:\n             for path in paths:\n                 if schema is None:\n-                    with fs.open(paths[0], \"rb\") as f:\n+                    with fs.open(path, \"rb\") as f:\n                         o = orc.ORCFile(f)\n                         schema = o.schema\n                 parts.append([(path, None)])\n```"
