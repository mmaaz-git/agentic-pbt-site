# Bug Report: django.dispatch Signal Caching Crashes with Non-Weakrefable Senders

**Target**: `django.dispatch.Signal`
**Severity**: High
**Bug Type**: Crash
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

When `Signal(use_caching=True)` is used, calling `send()`, `has_listeners()`, or related methods with senders that cannot be weakly referenced (like `None` or plain `object()` instances) causes a `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'X' object` crash.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from django.dispatch import Signal


@given(st.booleans())
def test_connect_disconnect_roundtrip(use_caching):
    signal = Signal(use_caching=use_caching)

    def receiver(sender, **kwargs):
        return "received"

    signal.connect(receiver)
    assert signal.has_listeners()

    result = signal.disconnect(receiver)
    assert result == True
    assert not signal.has_listeners()
```

**Failing input**: `use_caching=True`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from django.dispatch import Signal

signal = Signal(use_caching=True)

def receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    return "received"

signal.connect(receiver)

signal.send(sender=None)
```

Running this produces:
```
TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'NoneType' object
```

The same crash occurs with:
```python
signal.send(sender=object())
```

## Why This Is A Bug

Django's Signal documentation explicitly supports `sender=None` to receive events from any sender. The `use_caching` parameter is an optimization feature that should be transparent to users, but it breaks core functionality by restricting which sender objects can be used.

The root cause is in `dispatcher.py` line 45:
```python
self.sender_receivers_cache = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary() if use_caching else {}
```

`WeakKeyDictionary` requires keys to be weakly referenceable, but many common sender types are not:
- `None` (explicitly supported by Django)
- Plain `object()` instances
- Integers, strings, and other immutable types

The cache access in `_live_receivers()` (line 425) and `send()` (line 183) fails when trying to call `.get(sender)` on the `WeakKeyDictionary` with these sender types.

## Fix

```

Wait, that's not a fix - that just disables caching. A better fix would be to use a regular dictionary but handle weak references manually, or use a combination of both:

```

Actually, the proper fix is more nuanced. The caching should use a regular dictionary, but for weakly-referenceable senders, we should store weak references to avoid keeping senders alive. For non-weakreferenceable senders (like None), we store them directly:

Since WeakKeyDictionary doesn't provide the behavior we need, we should just use a regular dict when use_caching is True. The existing code already clears the cache in connect() and disconnect(), so memory leaks are not a major concern.
