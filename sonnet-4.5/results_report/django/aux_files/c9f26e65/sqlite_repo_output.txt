Input identifier: foo"bar
Django's quoted output: "foo"bar"

Correct SQL quoting: "foo""bar"
✓ Successfully created table with column: "foo""bar"

Testing Django's quoted output in SQLite:
Attempting to execute: CREATE TABLE test2 ("foo"bar" INTEGER)
✗ Failed with Django's quoting: unrecognized token: "" INTEGER)"

This is a syntax error because SQLite interprets the malformed SQL as:
  "foo" (identifier) followed by bar" (unexpected token)
