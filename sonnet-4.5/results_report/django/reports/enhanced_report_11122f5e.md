# Bug Report: django.core.files.utils.FileProxyMixin.closed Incorrectly Reports File Status for Falsy File Objects

**Target**: `django.core.files.utils.FileProxyMixin.closed`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `closed` property in Django's `FileProxyMixin` incorrectly reports a file as closed when the underlying file object is falsy (returns `False` from `__bool__`) but actually open, due to using boolean evaluation instead of identity checking.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from django.core.files.base import File

class FalsyButOpenFile:
    def __bool__(self):
        return False

    @property
    def closed(self):
        return False

@given(st.just(None))
def test_closed_property_with_falsy_file(x):
    falsy_file = FalsyButOpenFile()
    file_obj = File(falsy_file)

    assert not falsy_file.closed
    assert not file_obj.closed

# Run the test
test_closed_property_with_falsy_file()
```

**Failing input**: `x=None`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from django.core.files.base import File

class FalsyButOpenFile:
    def __bool__(self):
        return False

    @property
    def closed(self):
        return False

falsy_file = FalsyButOpenFile()
file_obj = File(falsy_file)

print(f"Underlying file closed: {falsy_file.closed}")
print(f"FileProxyMixin closed: {file_obj.closed}")

assert file_obj.closed == False, f"Expected False, got {file_obj.closed}"
```

## Why This Is A Bug

This violates expected behavior because `FileProxyMixin` is designed to proxy file methods to an underlying file object, yet it fails to correctly proxy the `closed` property. The bug occurs in line 53 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/files/utils.py` where `not self.file` incorrectly evaluates to `True` for any falsy file object, even when that object is actually open (`closed=False`).

This contradicts Python's standard file object protocol where the `closed` property should accurately reflect whether the stream is closed. The Python I/O documentation specifies that `closed` should return `True` only if the stream is actually closed, not based on the boolean evaluation of the file object itself. By conflating "falsiness" with "non-existence", the current implementation violates the principle of least surprise and can lead to incorrect behavior in code that relies on accurate file state reporting.

## Relevant Context

The `FileProxyMixin` class is used by Django's `File` class (in `django.core.files.base`) to forward file methods to an underlying file object. The mixin includes properties like `read`, `write`, `seek`, and `closed` that should accurately reflect the state of the wrapped file object.

The bug manifests when a custom file-like object defines a `__bool__` method that returns `False`. While this is an edge case, it's a valid Python pattern - for example, a file object might return `False` from `__bool__` to indicate it's empty or in some special state, while still being open for operations.

Other methods in `FileProxyMixin` like `readable()`, `writable()`, and `seekable()` (lines 55-74) depend on the `closed` property to determine their behavior, so this bug can cascade to affect these methods as well.
