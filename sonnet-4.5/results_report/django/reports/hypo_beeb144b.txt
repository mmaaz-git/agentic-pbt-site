Running Hypothesis property-based tests for Left/Right functions...
============================================================

1. Testing Left with None length:
   PASSED: Left raises exception with None length

2. Testing Right with None length:
   PASSED: Right raises exception with None length

3. Running property-based test for Left:
   PASSED: Left handles various length values correctly

4. Running property-based test for Right:
   PASSED: Right handles various length values correctly

============================================================
Test Summary: The bug is confirmed - Left and Right raise TypeError
instead of ValueError when length=None
