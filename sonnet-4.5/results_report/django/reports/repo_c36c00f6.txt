Comparison - Lag function with offset=0:
Error message: Lag requires a positive integer for the offset.

The NthValue error message contains 'as for nth' which is grammatically incorrect.
It should be either 'for nth' or 'as the nth parameter'.
Note how the Lag function correctly uses 'for the offset'.
