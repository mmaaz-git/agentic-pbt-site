# Bug Report: llm.default_plugins AsyncChat Duplicate Usage Assignment

**Target**: `llm.default_plugins.openai_models.AsyncChat.execute`
**Severity**: Low
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `AsyncChat.execute` method contains duplicate code that checks and assigns `chunk.usage` twice in a row, which is redundant and differs from the synchronous `Chat.execute` implementation.

## Property-Based Test

While this bug was discovered through code review rather than property-based testing, it represents a violation of the consistency property between the sync and async implementations.

## Reproducing the Bug

Lines 799-803 in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py`:

```python
async for chunk in completion:
    if chunk.usage:
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
    chunks.append(chunk)
    if chunk.usage:
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
```

The synchronous version (lines 713-716) correctly has only one check:

```python
for chunk in completion:
    chunks.append(chunk)
    if chunk.usage:
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
```

## Why This Is A Bug

1. **Duplicate code**: The `if chunk.usage:` check and assignment happens twice consecutively (lines 799-800 and 802-803)
2. **Inconsistency**: The async version differs from the sync version without justification
3. **Performance**: Unnecessary redundant check and assignment operation
4. **Copy-paste error**: This appears to be a copy-paste mistake during development
