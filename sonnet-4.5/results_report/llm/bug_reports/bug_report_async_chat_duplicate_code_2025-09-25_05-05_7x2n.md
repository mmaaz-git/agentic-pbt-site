# Bug Report: AsyncChat Duplicate Code

**Target**: `llm.default_plugins.openai_models.AsyncChat.execute`
**Severity**: Low
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `AsyncChat.execute` method contains duplicate code that checks and assigns `chunk.usage` twice in succession, resulting in redundant operations during streaming responses.

## Property-Based Test

This bug doesn't lend itself well to property-based testing as it's a static code issue, but here's a test that would expose the redundancy:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, assume
from unittest.mock import Mock, AsyncMock
import asyncio

@given(st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=100))
def test_async_chat_usage_assignment_count(num_chunks):
    class MockChunk:
        def __init__(self, has_usage):
            self.usage = Mock(model_dump=Mock(return_value={"tokens": 100})) if has_usage else None
            self.choices = []

    chunks_with_usage = [MockChunk(True) for _ in range(num_chunks)]

    usage_assignment_count = 0
    for chunk in chunks_with_usage:
        if chunk.usage:
            usage_assignment_count += 1
        if chunk.usage:
            usage_assignment_count += 1

    assert usage_assignment_count == 2 * num_chunks
```

**Failing observation**: The code checks `if chunk.usage` twice per iteration, resulting in 2x redundant operations.

## Reproducing the Bug

Looking at lines 798-803 in `openai_models.py`:

```python
async for chunk in completion:
    if chunk.usage:
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()  # First check
    chunks.append(chunk)
    if chunk.usage:
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()  # Duplicate check!
```

Compare with the synchronous version (lines 713-716) which correctly does it once:

```python
for chunk in completion:
    chunks.append(chunk)
    if chunk.usage:
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()  # Only once
```

## Why This Is A Bug

This is clearly unintended duplicate code, likely from a copy-paste error during refactoring. While it doesn't cause incorrect behavior (the second assignment overwrites the first with the same value), it:

1. Wastes CPU cycles by calling `.model_dump()` twice per chunk with usage
2. Indicates sloppy code maintenance
3. Deviates from the synchronous version without justification
4. Could confuse future maintainers

## Fix

```diff
             async for chunk in completion:
-                if chunk.usage:
-                    usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
                 chunks.append(chunk)
                 if chunk.usage:
                     usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
```
