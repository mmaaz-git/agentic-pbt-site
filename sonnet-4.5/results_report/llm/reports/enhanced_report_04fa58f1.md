# Bug Report: llm.utils.monotonic_ulid Breaks Strict Monotonicity When Clock Goes Backwards

**Target**: `llm.utils.monotonic_ulid`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `monotonic_ulid` function violates its documented guarantee of generating "strictly larger" ULIDs when the system clock moves backwards, producing ULIDs with earlier timestamps that compare as less than previously generated ULIDs.

## Why This Is A Bug

The `monotonic_ulid` function's docstring explicitly guarantees that it will "Return a ULID instance that is guaranteed to be *strictly larger* than every other ULID returned by this function inside the same process." This is an unqualified, absolute guarantee with no mentioned exceptions.

The bug occurs because the implementation has only three code paths:
1. First call (`_last is None`): Generates a fresh ULID
2. Same millisecond (`now_ms == last_ms`): Increments the randomness portion to maintain order
3. Different millisecond: Generates a fresh ULID with the current timestamp

The critical flaw is in path 3: there is no check for `now_ms < last_ms`. When the system clock moves backwards, the code generates a new ULID with the earlier timestamp. Since ULIDs are compared lexicographically with the timestamp as the most significant portion (first 48 bits), a ULID with an earlier timestamp will always be smaller than one with a later timestamp, regardless of the randomness portion.

This violates the strict monotonicity guarantee in real-world scenarios including:
- NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization adjustments
- Virtual machine migrations or suspensions
- Manual system time changes by administrators
- Leap second adjustments
- Container/virtualization time skew

The documentation states the function works "the same way the reference JavaScript `monotonicFactory` does" but only describes behavior for same-millisecond and forward-moving time, leaving backward time movement unspecified and incorrectly handled.

## Relevant Context

The bug is in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/utils.py` at lines 726-729. The function correctly handles incrementing randomness when multiple ULIDs are generated in the same millisecond (lines 715-725) but fails to handle the case where `now_ms < last_ms`.

The ULID specification (https://github.com/ulid/spec) consists of:
- 48-bit timestamp (millisecond precision Unix time)
- 80-bit randomness

ULIDs are lexicographically sortable because the timestamp is the most significant portion. This is why a ULID with timestamp 999ms will always be less than one with timestamp 1001ms, breaking monotonicity when clocks go backward.

The JavaScript reference implementation mentioned in the docstring (https://github.com/ulid/javascript) does handle clock regression by treating it similarly to the same-millisecond case, incrementing the randomness while keeping the higher timestamp.
