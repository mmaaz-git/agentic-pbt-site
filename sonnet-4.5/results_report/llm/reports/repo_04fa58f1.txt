Variable created with input: "2."
literal: 2.0
lookups: ('2', '')

BUG: Both literal and lookups are set!
This violates the class invariant that a Variable should be either a literal OR a lookup.

Attempting to resolve the Variable...
ERROR - VariableDoesNotExist: Failed lookup for key [2] in [{'True': True, 'False': False, 'None': None}, {}]
