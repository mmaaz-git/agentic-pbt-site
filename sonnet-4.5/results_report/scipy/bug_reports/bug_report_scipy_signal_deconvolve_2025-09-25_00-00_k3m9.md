# Bug Report: scipy.signal.deconvolve Violates Documented Property

**Target**: `scipy.signal.deconvolve`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `scipy.signal.deconvolve` function violates its documented mathematical property: `signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder`. Due to numerical instability in the underlying `lfilter` implementation, the reconstructed signal differs from the original for certain inputs, with errors as large as 451.0 in this example.

## Property-Based Test

```python
import numpy as np
import pytest
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, assume, settings
from scipy import signal


@settings(max_examples=1000)
@given(
    original_signal=st.lists(st.floats(allow_nan=False, allow_infinity=False,
                                        min_value=-1e6, max_value=1e6),
                             min_size=1, max_size=50),
    divisor=st.lists(st.floats(allow_nan=False, allow_infinity=False,
                                min_value=-1e6, max_value=1e6),
                     min_size=1, max_size=50)
)
def test_deconvolve_convolve_roundtrip(original_signal, divisor):
    original_signal = np.array(original_signal)
    divisor = np.array(divisor)

    assume(np.abs(divisor).max() > 1e-10)
    assume(np.abs(divisor[0]) > 1e-10)

    recorded = signal.convolve(divisor, original_signal)
    quotient, remainder = signal.deconvolve(recorded, divisor)
    reconstructed = signal.convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder

    assert reconstructed.shape == recorded.shape
    assert np.allclose(reconstructed, recorded, rtol=1e-8, atol=1e-10)
```

**Failing input**: `original_signal=[451211.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], divisor=[1.25, 79299.0]`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import signal

original_signal = np.array([451211.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0])
divisor = np.array([1.25, 79299.0])

recorded = signal.convolve(divisor, original_signal)
quotient, remainder = signal.deconvolve(recorded, divisor)
reconstructed = signal.convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder

print(f"Recorded:      {recorded}")
print(f"Reconstructed: {reconstructed}")
print(f"Max difference: {np.max(np.abs(reconstructed - recorded))}")
```

Output:
```
Recorded:      [5.64013750e+05 3.57805811e+10 0.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00
 0.00000000e+00 1.25000000e+00 7.92990000e+04]
Reconstructed: [5.64013750e+05 3.57805811e+10 0.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00
 0.00000000e+00 1.25000000e+00 7.88480000e+04]
Max difference: 451.0
```

## Why This Is A Bug

The function's docstring explicitly states: "Returns the quotient and remainder such that `signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder`". This is the fundamental contract of the deconvolve operation - it should be the inverse of convolve (up to a remainder).

The bug occurs because the current implementation uses `lfilter` to compute the quotient:
```python
quot = lfilter(num, den, input)
```

When the divisor has large coefficient ratios (like [1.25, 79299.0]), `lfilter` becomes numerically unstable, producing a quotient with extremely large values (e.g., 6.17861122e+13). When this unstable quotient is convolved back, numerical errors accumulate, violating the documented property.

## Fix

The root cause is numerical instability in the `lfilter`-based approach for deconvolution. A more stable implementation would use polynomial division or normalize the divisor before applying `lfilter`:

```diff

+++ b/scipy/signal/_signaltools.py

     if D > N:
         quot = []
         rem = num
     else:

+        scale = den[0]
+        den_norm = den / scale
+        num_norm = num / scale
         input = xp.zeros(N - D + 1, dtype=xp.float64)
         input[0] = 1
-        quot = lfilter(num, den, input)
-        rem = num - convolve(den, quot, mode='full')
+        quot = lfilter(num_norm, den_norm, input)
+        rem = num - convolve(den_norm, quot, mode='full') * scale
     return quot, rem
```

Note: This fix normalizes the divisor by its first coefficient to improve numerical stability. However, a complete fix may require more sophisticated numerical techniques or switching to a different deconvolution algorithm entirely.
