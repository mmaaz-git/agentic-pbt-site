simpson result: 1.0
Expected: 2.0

Explanation: When integrating y=x from 0 to 2, the mathematical result
should be ∫₀² x dx = x²/2 |₀² = 4/2 - 0/2 = 2.0

The duplicate x value at indices 1 and 2 (both equal to 1.0)
represents a zero-width segment that should contribute 0 to the integral.
However, simpson produces the result 1.0 instead of the correct value 2.0.
