Original array:
[[1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]]
Shape: (2, 3)

After rotation 1 (90° × 1 = 90°):
[[0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0.]]
Shape: (2, 3)

After rotation 2 (90° × 2 = 180°):
[[0.  0.5 0. ]
 [0.  0.5 0. ]]
Shape: (2, 3)

After rotation 3 (90° × 3 = 270°):
[[0.   0.25 0.  ]
 [0.   0.25 0.  ]]
Shape: (2, 3)

After rotation 4 (90° × 4 = 360°):
[[0.    0.125 0.   ]
 [0.    0.125 0.   ]]
Shape: (2, 3)

Expected: Should return to original array
Actual result after 4×90° rotations:
[[0.    0.125 0.   ]
 [0.    0.125 0.   ]]

Result of single 360° rotation:
[[1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]]

Are 4×90° rotations equal to original? False
Is single 360° rotation equal to original? True
