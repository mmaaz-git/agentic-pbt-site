Original transfer function:
  Numerator: [1.]
  Denominator: [1.]
  This represents H(s) = 1 (a constant)

State-space representation:
  A = [[0.]]
  B = [[0.]]
  C = [[0.]]
  D = [[1.]]

Reconstructed transfer function:
  Numerator: [[1. 0.]]
  Denominator: [1. 0.]

Analysis:
  Original degree: 0 / 0
  Reconstructed degree: 1 / 1

Issue:
  The original transfer function H(s) = 1 has degree 0.
  After round-trip conversion, we get H(s) = (s + 0)/(s + 0),
  which has degree 1 and a removable singularity at s=0.
  This violates the expected round-trip property.
