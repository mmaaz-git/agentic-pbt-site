 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5.]]

Expected: All zeros (gradient of constant is zero)
Actual:
  Top row = [5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5.]
  Bottom row = [5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5.]
  Left column = [5. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 5.]
  Right column = [5. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 5.]
  Max absolute value: 5.0
  Are all values zero? False

--- Comparison with mode='nearest' ---
With mode='nearest': max absolute value = 0.00e+00
Are all values zero? True

--- Analysis of non-zero locations ---
Non-zero locations (True means non-zero):
[[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]

 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]]
Total non-zero elements: 20 out of 100
