Testing jensenshannon with all-zero vectors:
p = [0. 0. 0.]
q = [0. 0. 0.]
jensenshannon(p, q) = nan
Result is NaN: True

==================================================
Testing jensenshannon with valid probability vectors:
p_valid = [0.3 0.3 0.4]
q_valid = [0.3 0.3 0.4]
jensenshannon(p_valid, q_valid) = 0.0
Result is approximately 0: True
