Running property-based test for RangeIndex.arange...

Test failed!

The test found a case where RangeIndex.arange produces a negative size.
This violates the invariant that array dimensions must be non-negative.

Minimal failing example found by Hypothesis:
  start=1.0, stop=0.0, step=1.0

Running the minimal example directly...
  Result: index.size = -1 (should be >= 0)

This proves that RangeIndex.arange can produce negative dimension sizes,
which violates fundamental array invariants.
