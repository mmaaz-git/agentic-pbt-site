Testing CombinedLock.locked() with all locks unlocked:
  Lock 1 is locked: False
  Lock 2 is locked: False
  combined.locked() returns: True
  Expected: False
  Actual type returned: <class 'bool'>

Debugging the issue:
  locks[0].locked (without parentheses): <built-in method locked of _thread.lock object at 0x71775db73f10>
  type(locks[0].locked): <class 'builtin_function_or_method'>
  bool(locks[0].locked): True

Testing CombinedLock.locked() with one lock locked:
  Lock 1 is locked: True
  Lock 2 is locked: False
  combined.locked() returns: True
  Expected: True
