Testing that to_bool rejects most floats but accepts 1.0 and 0.0...

Test 1: to_bool should reject floats other than 1.0 and 0.0
✓ Passed - all floats except 1.0 and 0.0 are rejected

Test 2: to_bool accepts 1.0 and 0.0 (undocumented behavior)
✓ Passed - 1.0 converts to True and 0.0 converts to False

This demonstrates the bug: 1.0 and 0.0 are accepted despite not being
in the documented list of accepted values.
