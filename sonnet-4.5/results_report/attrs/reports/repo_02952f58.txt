Original: obj.x = 10
Evolved: evolved.x = 20
Expected: 10, Got: 20

Demonstrating the issue with different values:
  Value=1: original.x=2, evolved.x=4, should be equal but aren't
  Value=3: original.x=6, evolved.x=12, should be equal but aren't
  Value=7: original.x=14, evolved.x=28, should be equal but aren't
  Value=10: original.x=20, evolved.x=40, should be equal but aren't
