Input: http_range = 'bytes=100-199,400-499,150-450', file_size = 1000
Result: [(100, 451), (400, 500)]

BUG: Ranges overlap: (100, 451) and (400, 500)
  Range 0 ends at 451, but range 1 starts at 400
  These ranges should have been merged into a single range

Expected behavior: These overlapping ranges should be merged into [(100, 500)]
