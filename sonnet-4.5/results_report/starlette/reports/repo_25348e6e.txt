Input line:
'    def example_function():'

Output from the buggy code:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdef&nbspexample_function():

Expected output (with proper HTML entities):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def&nbsp;example_function():

Note: The output is missing semicolons after '&nbsp' entities
This violates HTML5 specification which requires named character references to end with semicolon
