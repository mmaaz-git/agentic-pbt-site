Host header: [::1]:8000
Extracted host using split(':')[0]: [
Expected host: ::1

Testing various IPv6 addresses:
  Input: [::1]:8000
    Current extraction: [
    Expected: ::1
    Match: False

  Input: [2001:db8::1]:443
    Current extraction: [2001
    Expected: 2001:db8::1
    Match: False

  Input: [fe80::1]:80
    Current extraction: [fe80
    Expected: fe80::1
    Match: False

  Input: [::ffff:192.0.2.1]:8080
    Current extraction: [
    Expected: ::ffff:192.0.2.1
    Match: False

Real-world impact demonstration:
Creating TrustedHostMiddleware with allowed_hosts=['::1']
  Host header received: [::1]:8000
  Host extracted by middleware: [
  Allowed hosts: ['::1']
  Is valid host? False
  Result: Request would be REJECTED with 400 Invalid host header

Bug confirmed: extracted '[' instead of '::1'
