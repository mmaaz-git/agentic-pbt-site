Test 1 - Weak ETag W/"123" matches itself: False
  Expected: True, Got: False

Test 2 - Strong ETag "456" matches itself: True
  Expected: True, Got: True

Test 3 - Weak ETag W/"789" in list: False
  Expected: True, Got: False

--- Debugging the issue ---
Response ETag: W/"123"
Request If-None-Match: W/"123"
Stripped request tags: ['"123"']
Is 'W/"123"' in ['"123"']? False

The bug: response ETag 'W/"123"' is never normalized, but request tags are.
So we compare 'W/"123"' against ['"123"'], which fails!
