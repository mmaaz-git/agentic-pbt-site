Test 1: Single register/deregister cycle
----------------------------------------
  Initial: datetime.datetime in registry = False
  After register: datetime.datetime in registry = True
  After deregister: datetime.datetime in registry = True
  Registry not restored! Original had 1 converters, now has 4
    Added: <class 'datetime.date'>
    Added: <class 'datetime.datetime'>
    Added: <class 'numpy.datetime64'>
FAILED: Registry was not restored to original state
