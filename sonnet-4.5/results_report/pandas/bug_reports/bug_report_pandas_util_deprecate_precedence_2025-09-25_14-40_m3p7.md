# Bug Report: pandas.util._decorators.deprecate Operator Precedence Bug

**Target**: `pandas.util._decorators.deprecate`
**Severity**: Low
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `deprecate` function has an operator precedence bug in its docstring validation logic. Due to incorrect operator precedence, it fails to reject docstrings that lack a blank line after the summary, violating the documented format requirement.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings
from pandas.util._decorators import deprecate
import pytest


def create_docstring(empty1, summary, empty2, rest):
    return f"{empty1}\n{summary}\n{empty2}\n{rest}"


@given(
    st.text(min_size=1),
    st.text(min_size=1),
    st.text(min_size=1),
)
def test_deprecate_rejects_malformed_docstrings(summary, non_empty_after, rest):
    def bad_alternative():
        pass

    bad_alternative.__doc__ = f"\n{summary}\n{non_empty_after}\n{rest}"

    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
        deprecate("old", bad_alternative, "1.0")
```

**Failing input**: Any docstring where the line after the summary is not empty (e.g., `"\nSummary\nNext line\nRest"`)

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import deprecate


def bad_alternative():
    """
    Summary line
    Next line immediately (no blank line after summary)
    """
    pass


try:
    result = deprecate("old_func", bad_alternative, "1.0.0")
    print("BUG: Malformed docstring was accepted!")
except AssertionError:
    print("Correctly rejected")
```

**Output:**
```
BUG: Malformed docstring was accepted!
```

The docstring should be rejected because it doesn't have a blank line after the summary, but it passes validation.

## Why This Is A Bug

The `deprecate` function's documentation states that it requires:
> "a correctly formatted docstring in the target function (should have a one liner short summary, and opening quotes should be in their own line)"

The expected format is:
```python
"""
Summary line

Detailed description
"""
```

The validation code at line 84 in `_decorators.py` is:

```python
if empty1 or empty2 and not summary:
    raise AssertionError(doc_error_msg)
```

Due to Python's operator precedence (`and` binds tighter than `or`), this is evaluated as:

```python
if empty1 or (empty2 and not summary):
```

This only raises an error when:
1. The first line after the opening quotes is not empty, OR
2. The line after the summary is not empty AND there is no summary

However, it **fails to raise an error** when:
- The first line is empty (correct)
- The summary exists (correct)
- BUT the line after the summary is not empty (incorrect - should error!)

For example, with the docstring:
```
"""
Summary
Next line
Rest
```

When split: `empty1=""`, `summary="Summary"`, `empty2="Next line"`

The condition evaluates as:
```python
if "" or ("Next line" and not "Summary"):
if False or (True and False):
if False:
```

So no error is raised, even though the format is wrong.

## Fix

Add parentheses to fix the precedence:

```diff
-        if empty1 or empty2 and not summary:
+        if (empty1 or empty2) or not summary:
```

Or more clearly:

```diff
-        if empty1 or empty2 and not summary:
+        if empty1 or empty2 or not summary:
```

This ensures that an error is raised if ANY of these conditions are true:
- First line is not empty
- Line after summary is not empty
- Summary is missing
