# Bug Report: pandas.core.algorithms.factorize Null Character Handling

**Target**: `pandas.core.algorithms.factorize`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `factorize` function incorrectly treats null characters (`'\x00'`) as equivalent to empty strings (`''`), violating its documented round-trip property that `uniques.take(codes)` will have the same values as the input.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
import pandas.core.algorithms as algorithms

@given(st.lists(st.text(), min_size=1))
def test_factorize_round_trip_strings(values):
    """Round-trip property: uniques.take(codes) should equal values"""
    codes, uniques = algorithms.factorize(values)
    reconstructed = uniques.take(codes)
    assert len(reconstructed) == len(values)
    for i, (orig, recon) in enumerate(zip(values, reconstructed)):
        assert orig == recon, f"Mismatch at index {i}: {orig} != {recon}"
```

**Failing input**: `['', '\x00']`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import pandas.core.algorithms as algorithms

values = ['', '\x00']
codes, uniques = algorithms.factorize(values)

print(f"Input:         {values}")
print(f"Codes:         {codes}")
print(f"Uniques:       {uniques}")
print(f"Reconstructed: {uniques.take(codes)}")

assert values[1] == '\x00', "Original value is null character"
assert uniques.take(codes)[1] == '\x00', "Round-trip should preserve null character"
```

**Output**:
```
Input:         ['', '\x00']
Codes:         [0 0]
Uniques:       ['']
Reconstructed: ['' '']
AssertionError: Round-trip should preserve null character
```

## Why This Is A Bug

The `factorize` function's docstring explicitly states:

> "An integer ndarray that's an indexer into `uniques`. `uniques.take(codes)` will have the same values as `values`."

This property is violated when the input contains null characters. The function incorrectly:
1. Assigns the same code (0) to both `''` and `'\x00'`
2. Only includes `''` in the uniques array
3. Reconstructing via `uniques.take(codes)` produces `['', '']` instead of `['', '\x00']`

Null characters are valid string characters and should be treated as distinct from empty strings. This bug affects data integrity when processing strings that may contain null bytes.

## Fix

The issue appears to be in pandas' internal hashtable implementation which uses C-style string comparison that treats null bytes as string terminators. The fix would require:

1. Ensuring the hashtable uses Python string comparison semantics that treat null bytes as regular characters
2. Alternatively, documenting this limitation if it's a fundamental constraint of the implementation

A potential workaround for users is to avoid strings with null bytes or pre-process them by replacing `'\x00'` with a placeholder before factorization.
