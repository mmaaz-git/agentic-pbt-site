# Bug Report: pandas.core.window Rolling Variance Returns Negative Values

**Target**: `pandas.core.window.rolling.Rolling.var`
**Severity**: High
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The rolling variance computation can return mathematically impossible negative values when processing certain sequences of data, particularly after computing variance on very large numbers followed by small numbers.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings, assume
import pandas as pd

@given(
    data=st.lists(st.floats(allow_nan=False, allow_infinity=False, min_value=-1e10, max_value=1e10), min_size=3, max_size=20),
    window=st.integers(min_value=2, max_value=10)
)
@settings(max_examples=500)
def test_rolling_var_nonnegative(data, window):
    assume(window <= len(data))
    s = pd.Series(data)
    result = s.rolling(window=window).var()
    valid_results = result.dropna()
    for val in valid_results:
        assert val >= 0, f"Variance should be non-negative, got {val}"
```

**Failing input**: `data=[5897791891.464727, -2692142700.7497644, 0.0, 1.0], window=2`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [5897791891.464727, -2692142700.7497644, 0.0, 1.0]
s = pd.Series(data)
result = s.rolling(window=2).var()

print(result)

print(f"\nAt index 3 (window [0.0, 1.0]): {result.iloc[3]}")
print(f"Expected: 0.5")
print(f"Actual: {result.iloc[3]}")
```

**Output:**
```
0             NaN
1    3.689349e+19
2    3.623816e+18
3   -8.191500e+03
dtype: float64

At index 3 (window [0.0, 1.0]): -8191.5
Expected: 0.5
Actual: -8191.5
```

## Why This Is A Bug

Variance is mathematically defined as the average of squared deviations from the mean, which means it must always be non-negative (â‰¥ 0). The rolling variance for the window `[0.0, 1.0]` should be `0.5`, but instead returns `-8191.5`. This violates a fundamental mathematical property and indicates a numerical precision error in the rolling variance computation, likely related to accumulation of floating-point errors when processing very large numbers before small ones.

## Fix

This appears to be a numerical stability issue in the rolling variance algorithm. The implementation likely uses an incremental/online variance algorithm that accumulates errors when dealing with numbers of vastly different magnitudes. The fix would involve:

1. Using a numerically stable variance algorithm (e.g., Welford's online algorithm or two-pass algorithm)
2. Adding validation to ensure variance never becomes negative (fail-safe check)
3. Considering using higher precision arithmetic for intermediate calculations

The issue is likely in the C/Cython implementation at `pandas._libs.window.aggregations.roll_sum` or related functions, which would require examining the low-level implementation for the specific numerical stability issue.
