Input:  [0.01, 0.0100001]
Output: ['1%', '1%']
Unique inputs:  2
Unique outputs: 1

Expected: 2 unique outputs (since we have 2 unique inputs)
Actual: Only 1 unique output - both values formatted as '1%'

This violates the documented guarantee that:
'if any two elements of percentiles differ, they remain different after rounding'
