Input percentile: 1.401298464324817e-45
Output: 0%
Is percentile zero: False
Is percentile * 100 an integer: False

According to docstring:
1. 'no entry is *rounded* to 0% or 100%' (unless already equal to it)
2. 'Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place'

Bug: Non-zero value 1.401298464324817e-45 is formatted as '0%' with no decimal
