=== Bug Demonstration ===
Module name: 'lxml.etree'
Parent module (what code looks up): 'lxml'

Is 'lxml.etree' in VERSIONS? True
  Version requirement for 'lxml.etree': 4.9.2

Is 'lxml' in VERSIONS? False
  VERSIONS.get('lxml'): None

=== The Bug ===
Code at line 148 uses: VERSIONS.get('lxml') = None
It SHOULD use: VERSIONS.get('lxml.etree') = 4.9.2

Result: Version checking is completely skipped because minimum_version = None
Expected: Version checking should validate lxml.etree >= 4.9.2
