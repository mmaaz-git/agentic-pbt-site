custom_strlen called with: 'a'
custom_strlen called with: 'bb'

Result:
'a            c \nbb           dd'

Formatted output:
a            c 
bb           dd

==================================================
Notice: custom_strlen was only called for the first list items ('a' and 'bb'),
but NOT for the second list items ('c' and 'dd').
This demonstrates the bug where strlen is not applied consistently to all lists.
