Testing waitForPaste() with various timeout values:
==================================================

Test 1: timeout=0 (should timeout immediately)
Timed out after 0.0101s
Expected: <0.005s, Actual: 0.0101s
BUG CONFIRMED: Waited longer than expected

Test 2: timeout=-1 (negative, should timeout immediately)
Timed out after 0.0101s
Expected: <0.005s, Actual: 0.0101s
BUG CONFIRMED: Waited longer than expected

Test 3: timeout=0.001 (should timeout after ~0.001s)
Timed out after 0.0101s
Expected: ~0.001s, Actual: 0.0101s
BUG CONFIRMED: Waited much longer than expected

==================================================
Testing waitForNewPaste() with various timeout values:
==================================================

Test 4: waitForNewPaste with timeout=0
Timed out after 0.0101s
Expected: <0.005s, Actual: 0.0101s
BUG CONFIRMED: Waited longer than expected

Test 5: waitForNewPaste with timeout=-1
Timed out after 0.0101s
Expected: <0.005s, Actual: 0.0101s
BUG CONFIRMED: Waited longer than expected

==================================================
Summary: The bug exists because the timeout check occurs
AFTER time.sleep(0.01), causing a minimum wait of ~0.01s
regardless of the timeout value specified.
