Running Hypothesis test for Cython Shadow index_type bug
============================================================

Test: Step should only be provided once, not in multiple dimensions
Input: slices = (slice(None, None, 1), slice(None, None, 1))

FAILURE: Expected exception but got result: <class 'int'>[:, ::1]

The function should have raised an InvalidTypeSpecification exception
with message: 'Step may only be provided once, and only in the'
             'first or last dimension.'

This is a bug in the step validation logic!
