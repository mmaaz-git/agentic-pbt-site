=== Case 1: 0D array (scalar) ===
0D array: maybe_infer_ndim returned 0, expected 1 or 2
Array shape: (), ndim: 0

=== Case 2: 3D array ===
3D array: maybe_infer_ndim returned 3, expected 1 or 2
Array shape: (1, 2, 2), ndim: 3

=== Case 3: 4D array ===
4D array: maybe_infer_ndim returned 4, expected 1 or 2
Array shape: (1, 1, 1, 2), ndim: 4

=== Downstream Impact ===
