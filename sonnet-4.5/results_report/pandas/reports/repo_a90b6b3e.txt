compress_rowcols fully masked: shape=(1, 1) -> (0,), ndim=2 -> 1
compress_rows fully masked: shape=(1, 1) -> (0,), ndim=2 -> 1
compress_cols fully masked: shape=(1, 1) -> (0,), ndim=2 -> 1

Partially masked, all removed: shape=(2, 2) -> (0, 0), ndim=2 -> 2

Actual results:
Fully masked [[--]]: result = [], type = <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
Partially masked with all removed: result = [], type = <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
