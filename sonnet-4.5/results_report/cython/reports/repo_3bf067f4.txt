--- Test with more duplicates ---
Input: '0000000000'
Ranges returned: [48, 58]
Expected coverage: {'0'}
Actual coverage: {'2', '0', '8', '7', '3', '9', '4', '6', '1', '5'}
Extra characters incorrectly covered: {'2', '8', '7', '3', '9', '4', '6', '1', '5'}

--- Impact on Any() and AnyBut() ---
Testing Any('00'):
  Any('00') matched: '0' (should only match '0')

Testing AnyBut('00'):
  AnyBut('00') raised error: UnrecognizedInput: '', line 0, char 0: Token not recognised in state ''
  (This should NOT happen - '1' should be matched by AnyBut('00'))
