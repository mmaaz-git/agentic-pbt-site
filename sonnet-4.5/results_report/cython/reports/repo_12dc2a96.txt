Input:
  text = 'cy break spam '
  word = ''

Slicing operation:
  len(word) = 0
  text[:-len(word)] = text[:-0] = ''

Result of splitting:
  seen = set(text[:-len(word)].split()) = set()

Completion result:
  all_names = ['spam', 'eggs', 'ham', 'bacon']
  result = [n for n in all_names if n.startswith(word) and n not in seen]
  result = ['spam', 'eggs', 'ham', 'bacon']

Bug manifestation:
  'spam' in result = True
  Expected: False (spam should be filtered out as it's already typed)
  Actual: True (spam appears in suggestions due to empty seen set)
