Running property-based test for write_newer_file...
Testing with various string inputs when newer_than file doesn't exist.

Falsifying example: test_write_newer_file_terminates(
    content='',
)
‚ùå Test failed: write_newer_file entered infinite loop with content: ''

This confirms the bug: write_newer_file enters an infinite loop
when the newer_than file doesn't exist.
