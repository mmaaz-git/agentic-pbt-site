Input string: 'plugin1, plugin2, plugin3'
Split result: ['plugin1', ' plugin2', ' plugin3']
Split result (with repr): ["'plugin1'", "' plugin2'", "' plugin3'"]

✗ BUG: 'plugin2' NOT found in the list
  This is because the actual value is ' plugin2' with a leading space

✓ ' plugin2' (with leading space) IS in the list
  This means a plugin named 'plugin2' would NOT be disabled
  because 'plugin2' != ' plugin2'

Impact: When users write PYDANTIC_DISABLE_PLUGINS="plugin1, plugin2, plugin3"
        (with spaces after commas, which is natural), the plugins won't
        actually be disabled due to whitespace not being stripped.
