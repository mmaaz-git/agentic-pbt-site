Exception type: RuntimeError
Exception message: handler1 crashed
Expected exception type: ValidationError
Actual exception type: RuntimeError
Handler2 called: False

This demonstrates the bug:
1. The original ValidationError is masked by handler1's RuntimeError
2. Handler2 never gets executed because handler1 crashed
