Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I successfully reproduced the bug report. The issue is confirmed to be present in the attrs library.

Steps taken:
1. Ran the provided reproduction code that attempts to call cmp_using() with only a `lt` parameter
2. Confirmed the ValueError is raised as expected
3. Verified the error message contains the reported typos

Test Results:
- When calling `cmp_using(lt=lambda a, b: a < b)` without providing `eq`, a ValueError is raised
- The error message is: "eq must be define is order to complete ordering from lt, le, gt, ge."
- This confirms the two grammatical errors:
  * "define" should be "defined" (missing 'd')
  * "is order" should be "in order"

Source Code Verification:
- Located the error message in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/attrs_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/_cmp.py` at line 105
- The typo is exactly as reported in the bug report
- The error occurs when trying to use functools.total_ordering without an eq function

The bug is real and reproducible. The error message is indeed grammatically incorrect with two typos that would confuse users reading the error message.
