BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs in the `attr.filters._split_what` function when it receives a generator as input.

## Verification Steps Performed

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction**
   - Ran the provided Hypothesis test
   - Test fails immediately with input `items=['0']`
   - The test correctly identifies that when _split_what receives a generator, it produces different results than when it receives a list
   - Confirmed: Generator exhaustion causes empty frozensets for names and attrs

2. **Manual Example Reproduction**
   - Tested with mixed input: [int, str, "name1", "name2", float]
   - When passed as generator: Classes are correctly identified, but Names and Attrs are empty frozensets
   - When passed as list: All three categories (Classes, Names, Attrs) are correctly populated
   - The bug is confirmed: generator exhaustion after first iteration

## Root Cause Analysis

The function `_split_what` iterates over the `what` parameter three times:
1. Line 15: `frozenset(cls for cls in what if isinstance(cls, type))`
2. Line 16: `frozenset(cls for cls in what if isinstance(cls, str))`
3. Line 17: `frozenset(cls for cls in what if isinstance(cls, Attribute))`

When `what` is a generator:
- The first iteration exhausts the generator
- The second and third iterations receive an empty generator
- This results in empty frozensets for names and attributes

## Impact Assessment

The bug is real but has limited practical impact:
1. The function `_split_what` is a private function (starts with underscore)
2. The public functions `include()` and `exclude()` work correctly because they pass arguments as tuples, not generators
3. However, if someone directly calls `_split_what` with a generator (which is possible since it's importable), they will encounter this bug

## Test Results

Generator input to _split_what([int, str, "field1", "field2", float]):
- Classes: frozenset({int, str, float})  ✓ Correct
- Names: frozenset()                     ✗ Should be {"field1", "field2"}
- Attrs: frozenset()                     ✓ Correct (no Attribute objects)

List input to _split_what([int, str, "field1", "field2", float]):
- Classes: frozenset({int, str, float})  ✓ Correct
- Names: frozenset({"field1", "field2"}) ✓ Correct
- Attrs: frozenset()                     ✓ Correct
