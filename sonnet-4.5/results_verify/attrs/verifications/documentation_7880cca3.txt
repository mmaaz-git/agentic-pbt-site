## Documentation Analysis

### Internal Documentation Review:

1. **Function Docstring (line 484-493):**
   - States: "A validator that raises `ValueError` if the initializer is called with a number smaller or equal to *val*."
   - This description is CORRECT - it describes > (greater than) behavior
   - States: "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values."
   - This is INCORRECT - the code uses `operator.gt`

2. **Comparison with Other Validators:**
   I examined the documentation for related validators in the same file:

   - `ge(val)`: Correctly states "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values"
   - `lt(val)`: Correctly states "The validator uses `operator.lt` to compare the values"
   - `le(val)`: Correctly states "The validator uses `operator.le` to compare the values"
   - `gt(val)`: INCORRECTLY states "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values"

   This shows a clear copy-paste error where the `gt` validator's docstring was likely copied from `ge` without updating the operator reference.

3. **External Documentation:**
   - The official attrs documentation at https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#validators repeats the same error
   - It states the gt validator "uses `operator.ge` to compare the values" which is incorrect

### Expected Behavior Analysis:

The function name `gt` clearly indicates "greater than" which in Python corresponds to the `>` operator and `operator.gt`. The docstring's first sentence correctly describes this behavior ("smaller or equal to *val*" means rejection, which is correct for >). The reference to `operator.ge` (>=) is inconsistent with:
1. The function name
2. The behavioral description
3. The actual implementation
4. The pattern established by other validators

### Conclusion:
This is a clear documentation error. The implementation is correct and matches the expected behavior for a "greater than" validator. The documentation should be updated to reference `operator.gt` instead of `operator.ge`.
