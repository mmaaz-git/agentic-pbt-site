# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### Docstring for or_() (lines 688-705 in validators.py)

The docstring states:
```
A validator that composes multiple validators into one.

When called on a value, it runs all wrapped validators until one of them is
satisfied.

Raises:
    ValueError:
        If no validator is satisfied. Raised with a human-readable error
        message listing all the wrapped validators and the value that
        failed all of them.
```

Key observations:
- The documentation only mentions raising `ValueError` when no validator is satisfied
- There is NO specification about which exceptions should be caught from validators
- There is NO mention of how to handle programming errors vs validation errors
- The phrase "until one of them is satisfied" doesn't specify what "satisfied" means

### Online Documentation (attrs.org)

The online documentation similarly:
- Only mentions that `ValueError` is raised "if no validator is satisfied"
- Does not specify which exceptions should be caught from validators
- Does not discuss the distinction between validation errors and programming errors

### Comparison with not_() validator

The `not_()` validator documentation (line 631-653) explicitly:
- Documents the `exc_types` parameter with default `(ValueError, TypeError)`
- States: "Exception type(s) to capture. Other types raised by child validators will not be intercepted and pass through."
- This shows that attrs DOES have a concept of selective exception catching

## Documentation Gaps

1. **No explicit specification**: The documentation doesn't specify that `or_()` should catch ALL exceptions
2. **No guidance on error types**: There's no documentation about distinguishing validation errors from programming errors
3. **Inconsistency**: The `not_()` validator has explicit, limited exception catching, while `or_()` documentation doesn't mention exception handling at all
4. **Ambiguity**: "Until one of them is satisfied" doesn't clearly define what constitutes satisfaction

## Reasonable User Expectations

Given that:
1. The `not_()` validator explicitly limits exception catching to validation errors
2. Common Python practice is to let programming errors propagate for debugging
3. The documentation doesn't say programming errors will be swallowed

A reasonable user would expect that programming errors (NameError, AttributeError, etc.) would NOT be caught and would propagate for debugging purposes.
