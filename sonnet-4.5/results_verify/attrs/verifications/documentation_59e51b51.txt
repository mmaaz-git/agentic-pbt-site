Documentation Analysis
======================

1. Official Documentation Review
--------------------------------
From the official attrs documentation (www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#validators):

a) in_() validator documentation:
   - States it raises ValueError with:
     * A human-readable error message
     * The attribute (of type attrs.Attribute)
     * The expected options
     * The value it got
   - Version history notes:
     * Added in v17.1.0
     * v22.1.0: "The ValueError was incomplete until now and only contained the human readable error message. Now it contains all the information that has been promised since 17.1.0."
     * This explicitly confirms a standardization effort in v22.1.0

b) instance_of() validator documentation:
   - States it raises TypeError with:
     * A human-readable error message
     * The attribute (of type attrs.Attribute)
     * The expected type
     * The value it got

c) or_() validator documentation:
   - Added in v24.1.0
   - Current docstring says it raises ValueError:
     * "If no validator is satisfied. Raised with a human-readable error message listing all the wrapped validators and the value that failed all of them."
   - NOTABLY: Does NOT mention passing the attribute or structured data like other validators

2. API Contract Analysis
------------------------
Version 22.1.0 release established a clear pattern for validator exceptions:
- The changelog explicitly states that ValueErrors were "incomplete until now"
- It promises that exceptions now contain "all the information that has been promised since 17.1.0"
- This creates an implicit API contract that all validators should follow this pattern

3. Documentation Inconsistency
------------------------------
The or_() validator's documentation (lines 699-702 in validators.py) only mentions:
- "Raised with a human-readable error message listing all the wrapped validators and the value that failed all of them"

This documentation does NOT specify the structured exception format that other validators document. However:
- or_() was added in v24.1.0, AFTER the v22.1.0 standardization
- It should follow the established pattern for consistency
- The documentation's omission of structured data appears to be an oversight rather than intentional

4. Conclusion
-------------
The documentation analysis confirms:
1. A clear API pattern was established in v22.1.0 for validator exceptions
2. All pre-existing validators were updated to follow this pattern
3. The or_() validator (added in v24.1.0) does not follow this pattern
4. The or_() documentation does not explicitly promise structured data, but this appears to be an oversight given the established pattern

This is not a case where the code violates its documentation - rather, both the code AND documentation for or_() fail to follow the established API pattern that all other validators use.
