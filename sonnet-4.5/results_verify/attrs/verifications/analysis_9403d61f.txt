BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

CATEGORY CONSIDERATION:

1. BUG
   FOR:
   - This is an actual typo in the codebase ("du to" instead of "due to")
   - The typo is in production code that users can see
   - It's a grammatical error that makes the documentation incorrect

   AGAINST:
   - It's only a documentation issue, not a functional bug
   - The function is deprecated (though still present)
   - The meaning is still understandable despite the typo

2. WONTFIX
   FOR:
   - The typo is trivial and doesn't affect functionality
   - The function is deprecated since 2017 (version 17.1.0)
   - Users are discouraged from using this function anyway
   - The meaning is still clear despite the typo

   AGAINST:
   - The function still exists and won't be removed
   - Users can still access and read this docstring
   - Fixing a typo is trivial and improves code quality

3. INVALID
   FOR:
   - (No strong arguments for invalid)

   AGAINST:
   - The typo genuinely exists
   - The report is accurate
   - The location and description are correct

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   FOR:
   - This is purely a documentation issue (docstring typo)
   - No code functionality is affected
   - The fix only requires changing documentation text
   - This is the most accurate categorization

   AGAINST:
   - (No arguments against - this is clearly a documentation issue)

5. FEATURE_REQUEST
   FOR:
   - (No arguments - this is not a feature request)

   AGAINST:
   - This is reporting an existing error, not requesting new functionality
   - The correct spelling already exists in English

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- Low severity (as stated in bug report)
- No functional impact
- Only affects documentation readability
- Simple one-word fix

RECOMMENDATION:
This should be categorized as DOCUMENTATION_FIX. While it could arguably be WONTFIX due to the function being deprecated and the typo being trivial, the fact remains that:
1. The typo exists
2. The function is still in the codebase
3. The docstring is user-visible
4. The fix is trivial (change "du" to "due")
5. Correct documentation improves code quality

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, and provides the exact fix needed.
