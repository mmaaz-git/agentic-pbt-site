Bug Report Triage Analysis
==========================

Consideration for each category:

BUG:
----
Arguments FOR:
- The error message contains clear grammatical errors ("define" instead of "defined", "is order" instead of "in order")
- Error messages are part of the user-facing API and should be grammatically correct
- The fix is trivial and improves code quality
- Professional software should have correct grammar in user-facing messages
- The typos could confuse non-native English speakers or make the library appear unprofessional

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not a functional bug - the code works correctly
- Users can still understand the intent despite the typos
- It's a minor text issue, not a behavioral problem

WONTFIX:
--------
Arguments FOR:
- The error message, while grammatically incorrect, is still understandable
- This is an extremely minor issue that doesn't affect functionality
- Users encountering this error can still understand what they need to do (provide eq parameter)
- Development time might be better spent on functional improvements

Arguments AGAINST:
- The fix is trivial (changing a single string)
- Error messages are important for developer experience
- Leaving known typos reflects poorly on code quality

INVALID:
--------
Arguments FOR:
- Could argue that error message text is not specified in documentation, so any text is acceptable

Arguments AGAINST:
- Grammatical correctness in error messages is a reasonable expectation
- The typos are objectively errors in English grammar
- Professional software should maintain quality in all user-facing text

FEATURE_REQUEST:
---------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could frame this as requesting "better error messages" rather than fixing a bug

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is fixing existing broken text, not adding new functionality
- The current text contains objective grammatical errors

DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
-----------------
Arguments FOR:
- Error messages could be considered a form of inline documentation

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is code (error message string), not documentation
- The issue is in the actual source code, not in documentation files
- Users encounter this through runtime errors, not reading docs

Conclusion:
----------
This is clearly a BUG. While minor, it represents objective grammatical errors in user-facing error messages. The errors are:
1. "define" should be "defined" (typo/grammar error)
2. "is order" should be "in order" (typo/grammar error)

These are not matters of style or preference but clear mistakes in English grammar that should be corrected for professional quality software. The fix is trivial and improves the user experience.
