## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in attrs' asdict() function. Here's what I found:

### 1. Bug Confirmation
The bug is **REAL** and **REPRODUCIBLE**. When calling `asdict()` with `retain_collection_types=True` on an attrs class containing namedtuples within a list, the function crashes with:
```
TypeError: Point.__new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'
```

### 2. Test Results

#### Simple reproduction test:
```python
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
@attr.s
class Container:
    points = attr.ib()

c = Container(points=[Point(1, 2)])
result = asdict(c, retain_collection_types=True)  # CRASHES
```
Result: **TypeError** as reported

#### Control test without retain_collection_types:
```python
result = asdict(c)  # Works fine
# Output: {'points': [[1, 2]]}
```
Result: **SUCCESS** - Works when retain_collection_types is False/default

### 3. Root Cause Verification
I examined the source code in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/_funcs.py`:

- Lines 96-103: Main `asdict()` function has workaround for namedtuples with try/except block
- Lines 163-175: Helper `_asdict_anything()` function lacks the same workaround
- The inconsistency causes crashes when namedtuples appear in nested collections

### 4. Code Comments Confirm Intent
The source code contains comments acknowledging this is a known workaround:
- Line 102: "# Workaround for TypeError: cf.__new__() missing 1 required positional argument (which appears, for a namedturle)"
- Line 289: Similar comment in `astuple()` function

Note: There's a typo "namedturle" instead of "namedtuple" in the comments.

### Conclusion
The bug is confirmed and the analysis in the bug report is accurate. The `_asdict_anything()` helper function needs the same namedtuple workaround that exists in the main `asdict()` function.
