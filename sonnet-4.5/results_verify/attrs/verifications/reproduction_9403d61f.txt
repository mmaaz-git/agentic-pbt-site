Bug Report: Typo in attr.assoc() function docstring

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Imported the attr module
2. Accessed the docstring via attr.assoc.__doc__
3. Searched for the reported typo "du to"

RESULTS:
✓ The typo exists as reported
✓ Location confirmed: Line 383 of /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/attrs_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/_funcs.py
✓ The docstring contains: "removed du to the slightly different approach"
✓ This should be: "removed due to the slightly different approach"

VERIFICATION:
- Created and ran a test script that confirms the presence of "du to" in the docstring
- Verified that the correct spelling "due to" is NOT present in the docstring
- Examined the source file directly at the specified line number

NATURE OF BUG:
This is a simple typographical error in documentation. The word "du" should be "due".
The typo appears in a deprecation notice for the attr.assoc function.

IMPACT:
- This is purely a documentation typo
- It does not affect functionality
- It makes the deprecation notice grammatically incorrect
- Users reading the documentation will see an obvious spelling error

CONCLUSION:
The bug report is accurate. The typo "du to" instead of "due to" exists exactly as described in the bug report.
