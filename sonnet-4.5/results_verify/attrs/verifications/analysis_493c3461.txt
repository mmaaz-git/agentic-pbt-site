TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Inconsistent with Library Patterns**: All other validators in attrs catch specific exceptions (ValueError/TypeError), not all exceptions
2. **Explicit Precedent**: The `not_()` validator explicitly defines `exc_types=(ValueError, TypeError)` as the default, establishing the contract
3. **Hides Real Errors**: Catching Exception masks programming errors (AttributeError, KeyError, etc.) that should propagate for debugging
4. **Linter Warnings**: The code has three linter suppressions (BLE001, PERF203, S112) acknowledging this is problematic
5. **Debugging Impact**: Makes debugging significantly harder by converting all errors to generic "None of ... satisfied" messages
6. **Best Practices Violation**: Catching Exception is a well-known Python anti-pattern

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly say it shouldn't catch all exceptions
- Code has been this way for a while, changing might break existing code

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly specify which exceptions should be caught
- Some might argue this is working as designed

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The consistent pattern across all validators establishes an implicit contract
- The `not_()` validator makes the contract explicit
- Catching Exception is universally considered bad practice
- The linter suppressions acknowledge this is problematic

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Changing behavior might break existing code that relies on this
- The issue might be considered minor

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is a significant debugging impediment
- The current behavior hides real bugs
- The fix is simple and aligns with established patterns

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be clearer about exception handling
- Could document that `or_()` catches all exceptions as a "feature"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation
- Documenting bad practice doesn't make it good practice
- Other validators establish the pattern clearly

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame as requesting better exception handling

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The expected behavior already exists in other validators

## Analysis Summary

The evidence strongly points to this being a **valid bug**:

1. **Clear Pattern Violation**: Every other validator in attrs follows the ValueError/TypeError pattern
2. **Explicit Contract**: The `not_()` validator explicitly defaults to `(ValueError, TypeError)`
3. **Code Smell Acknowledgment**: The linter suppressions show awareness of the problem
4. **Real Impact**: This genuinely hinders debugging by hiding programming errors
5. **Simple Fix**: The fix aligns the behavior with the rest of the library
6. **Best Practices**: Catching Exception is universally discouraged in Python

The fact that the `not_()` validator explicitly defines which exceptions to catch (defaulting to ValueError and TypeError) establishes the intended contract for validator exception handling. The `or_()` validator violating this pattern is clearly a bug, not a feature or documentation issue.
