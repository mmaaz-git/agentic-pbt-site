DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

FUNCTION: attr.assoc

STATUS IN DOCUMENTATION:
1. The function is NOT documented in the current official attrs documentation (attrs.org)
2. The function exists in the codebase but is deprecated since version 17.1.0
3. The deprecation notice itself contains the typo being reported

DEPRECATION CONTEXT:
- attr.assoc is deprecated in favor of attrs.evolve
- The docstring states it won't be removed despite deprecation
- This is due to edge cases where evolve doesn't work (GitHub issue #251)
- Issue #251 describes problems with evolve when attributes have init=False

TYPO IN CONTEXT:
The typo appears in the deprecation notice:
"This function will not be removed du to the slightly different approach"

Should be:
"This function will not be removed due to the slightly different approach"

VERIFICATION FROM SOURCES:
1. GitHub repository confirms the typo exists in main branch
2. Local installation confirms the typo exists
3. The typo is in internal documentation (docstring), not user-facing docs

GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS:
- "du" is not a valid English word in this context
- "due to" is the correct English phrase meaning "because of"
- This is clearly a typographical error, not intentional

IMPACT ON USERS:
- Users who inspect the function with help() or .__doc__ will see the typo
- IDEs that display docstrings will show the incorrect text
- The typo does not affect functionality, only readability

CONCLUSION:
This is a legitimate documentation typo that should be fixed. While the function is deprecated, it still exists in the codebase and its docstring should be grammatically correct.
