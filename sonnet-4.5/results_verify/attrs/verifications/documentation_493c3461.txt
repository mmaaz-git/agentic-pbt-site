DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Official Documentation Review

### or_ Validator Documentation

The official attrs documentation for `or_()` states:
- "When called on a value, it runs all wrapped validators until one of them is satisfied."
- If no validator is satisfied, it raises a ValueError
- No explicit specification of which exception types should be caught from child validators

### Validator Contract in attrs

After examining the source code and documentation:

1. **Standard Validation Exceptions**: All built-in attrs validators follow a consistent pattern:
   - `instance_of()`: raises TypeError for type mismatches
   - `in_()`: raises ValueError for value not in options
   - `matches_re()`: raises ValueError for regex mismatch
   - `lt()`, `le()`, `gt()`, `ge()`: raise ValueError for comparison failures
   - `max_len()`, `min_len()`: raise ValueError for length violations

2. **The not_() Validator Pattern**:
   - Explicitly defaults to catching only `(ValueError, TypeError)`
   - Documentation states: "Exception type(s) to capture. Other types raised by child validators will not be intercepted and pass through."
   - This establishes a clear precedent that validators should only catch specific validation exceptions

3. **No Documentation Supporting Broad Exception Catching**:
   - There is no documentation that suggests validators should catch all exceptions
   - The documentation does not state that `or_()` should behave differently from other validators

## Implicit Contract

Based on examining all validators in attrs:
1. Validators should raise ValueError or TypeError for validation failures
2. Other exceptions (AttributeError, KeyError, etc.) indicate programming errors, not validation failures
3. Programming errors should propagate to help debugging

## Documentation Gap

The documentation for `or_()` doesn't explicitly state which exceptions it catches, but:
1. The consistent pattern across all other validators suggests ValueError/TypeError are the standard
2. The `not_()` validator makes this explicit with its `exc_types` parameter
3. No documentation suggests `or_()` should deviate from this pattern

## Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that `or_()` should only catch ValueError/TypeError, the implicit contract established by:
- All other built-in validators
- The explicit `exc_types` parameter in `not_()`
- Standard Python practices (catching Exception is an anti-pattern)

...strongly suggests that catching all exceptions is unintended behavior rather than a documented feature. The lack of documentation about catching all exceptions, combined with the linter suppressions in the code, indicates this is likely a bug rather than intended behavior.
