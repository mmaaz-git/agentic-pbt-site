## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report is accurate. The `attrs.validators.gt()` function has a documentation error where its docstring incorrectly states it uses `operator.ge` when it actually uses `operator.gt`.

### Reproduction Steps

1. Ran the provided reproduction code which confirmed:
   - The docstring claims: "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values."
   - The actual implementation uses: `operator.gt`
   - Test output confirmed: `gt_validator.compare_func == operator.gt` returns True
   - Test output confirmed: `gt_validator.compare_func == operator.ge` returns False

2. Ran the Hypothesis property-based test which failed specifically for `validators.gt`:
   - The test correctly identifies that the docstring mentions `operator.ge`
   - The test correctly verifies that the actual operator is `operator.gt`
   - The assertion fails as expected, demonstrating the inconsistency

3. Examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/attrs_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/validators.py`:
   - Line 488: Docstring says "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values."
   - Line 495: Implementation returns `_NumberValidator(val, ">", operator.gt)`
   - This confirms the mismatch between documentation and implementation

### Effect
The bug is purely a documentation issue. The functionality is correct (a greater-than validator should use `operator.gt`), but the docstring is wrong. This could confuse users reading the documentation, though the actual validation behavior works as expected.

### Comparison with Other Validators
Checked the other comparison validators for consistency:
- `lt()` correctly documents and uses `operator.lt`
- `le()` correctly documents and uses `operator.le`
- `ge()` correctly documents and uses `operator.ge`
- `gt()` incorrectly documents `operator.ge` but uses `operator.gt`

This confirms that `gt()` is the only one with a documentation mismatch, likely due to a copy-paste error from the `ge()` function.
