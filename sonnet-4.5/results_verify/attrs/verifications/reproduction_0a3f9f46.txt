REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Bug Report Claims

The bug report claims that `attrs.validators.or_` catches ALL exceptions (including NameError, AttributeError, KeyError, etc.), masking programming errors in validators and making debugging difficult. It also claims this is inconsistent with `and_` validator behavior.

## Reproduction Results

### 1. Testing or_ validator

I created a test with a buggy validator that references an undefined variable (which should raise NameError):

```python
def buggy_validator(inst, attr, value):
    undefined_variable  # Should raise NameError

def working_validator(inst, attr, value):
    pass

v = validators.or_(buggy_validator, working_validator)
v(None, None, 42)  # Should raise NameError but doesn't
```

**Result**: CONFIRMED - The code runs without raising any exception. The or_ validator catches the NameError and continues to the next validator, ultimately succeeding.

### 2. Testing and_ validator

I tested the same scenario with `and_` validator:

```python
def buggy_validator(inst, attr, value):
    undefined_variable  # Should raise NameError

def working_validator(inst, attr, value):
    pass

v = validators.and_(working_validator, buggy_validator)
v(None, None, 42)  # Raises NameError as expected
```

**Result**: CONFIRMED - The and_ validator properly propagates the NameError, making the programming error immediately visible.

### 3. Source Code Analysis

Examining the actual implementation confirms the issue:

**_OrValidator (attr/validators.py lines 671-681):**
```python
def __call__(self, inst, attr, value):
    for v in self.validators:
        try:
            v(inst, attr, value)
        except Exception:  # <- Catches ALL exceptions
            continue
        else:
            return
```

**_AndValidator (attr/_make.py lines 3038-3040):**
```python
def __call__(self, inst, attr, value):
    for v in self._validators:
        v(inst, attr, value)  # <- No exception handling
```

### 4. Standard Validator Behavior

I tested standard attrs validators to understand what exceptions they normally raise:
- `instance_of`: Raises `TypeError` for wrong type
- `in_`: Raises `ValueError` for value not in collection
- `gt`: Raises `ValueError` for value not greater than threshold
- `matches_re`: Raises `ValueError` for regex mismatch
- `min_len`: Raises `ValueError` for insufficient length

All standard validators raise either `ValueError` or `TypeError` for validation failures, never other exception types like NameError, AttributeError, etc.

## Conclusion

The bug report is ACCURATE:

1. The or_ validator does catch ALL exceptions (line 675: `except Exception`)
2. This masks programming errors like NameError, AttributeError, KeyError, etc.
3. The and_ validator does NOT catch exceptions and properly propagates them
4. This creates an inconsistency between the two validators
5. Standard validators only raise ValueError or TypeError for validation failures

The bug makes debugging extremely difficult because typos or other programming errors in validators are silently ignored when using or_, potentially causing validators to be skipped unintentionally.
