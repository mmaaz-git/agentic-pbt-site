## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for Each Category:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The crash is real and reproducible with minimal code
- There's clear inconsistency: main `asdict()` has namedtuple workaround, but `_asdict_anything()` helper doesn't
- The existing workarounds in two places (asdict and astuple) show this is intended functionality
- The bug causes a crash rather than graceful degradation
- The fix is straightforward: apply the same workaround pattern
- Comments in code acknowledge namedtuples need special handling

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise namedtuple support
- Could argue namedtuples are an edge case

**Verdict: STRONG case for BUG**

#### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state namedtuples are supported
- User could convert namedtuples to regular tuples before calling asdict()

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code already has workarounds for namedtuples in two places
- The crash is real and happens with reasonable usage
- The inconsistency is clearly unintentional

**Verdict: NOT INVALID - the bug is real**

#### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Namedtuples might be considered a niche use case
- Users can work around by not using retain_collection_types

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This causes a crash, not just incorrect behavior
- The fix is simple and consistent with existing code
- Namedtuples are a standard Python feature, not obscure
- The library already supports namedtuples elsewhere

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - crashes are serious**

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that full namedtuple support is a new feature
- Documentation doesn't promise this works

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The main function already has the workaround - it's partially implemented
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new capability
- The crash indicates broken existing functionality

**Verdict: NOT a feature request - fixing existing partial implementation**

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation could be clearer about namedtuple handling
- The typo "namedturle" in comments should be fixed

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The primary issue is a code bug causing crashes
- Documentation updates would be secondary to fixing the crash
- The code intent is clear from existing workarounds

**Verdict: NOT primarily a documentation issue**

### Final Analysis:

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Inconsistent Implementation**: The codebase has namedtuple workarounds in 2 of 3 places where needed. The `_asdict_anything()` function is missing the same workaround that exists in `asdict()` and `astuple()`.

2. **Crashes vs. Graceful Failure**: The bug causes a hard crash (TypeError) rather than returning incorrect data or degrading gracefully.

3. **Clear Intent**: The existing workarounds with explicit comments show the library intends to support namedtuples. This isn't undefined behavior.

4. **Simple Fix**: The solution is to apply the exact same try/except pattern that already exists elsewhere in the code.

5. **Reasonable Use Case**: Using namedtuples in attrs classes is a reasonable scenario, especially with `retain_collection_types=True` which implies preserving the original types.

The bug report is well-written, includes a minimal reproduction case, identifies the exact problem location, and even provides a fix. This is a textbook example of a valid bug report that should be addressed.
