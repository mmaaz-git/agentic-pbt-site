Documentation Analysis
=====================

Documentation Review:
-------------------
1. attrs.cmp_using() documentation states:
   - "The resulting class will have a full set of ordering methods if at least one of {lt, le, gt, ge} and eq are provided."
   - The eq parameter is described as "Callable used to evaluate equality of two objects"
   - No specific error messages are documented

2. Python functools.total_ordering documentation states:
   - "The class must define one of __lt__(), __le__(), __gt__(), or __ge__(). In addition, the class should supply an __eq__() method."
   - The word "should" indicates a strong recommendation for __eq__

3. Code comment analysis (line 103-104):
   - "functools.total_ordering requires __eq__ to be defined, so raise early error here to keep a nice stack."
   - This confirms that eq is indeed required when using partial ordering functions

Findings:
--------
- The requirement for eq when using ordering functions is technically correct and aligned with Python's functools.total_ordering requirements
- The error being raised is appropriate and expected behavior
- The documentation doesn't specify the exact error message text, so there's no documentation conflict
- The issue is purely about the grammatical correctness of the error message text itself

The error message serves an important purpose: informing users that eq must be provided when using partial ordering functions. The typos in the message don't affect functionality but do impact the professional quality and clarity of the error communication.
