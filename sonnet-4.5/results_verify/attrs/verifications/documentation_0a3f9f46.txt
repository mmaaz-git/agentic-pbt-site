DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Official Documentation Review

### 1. attrs.validators.or_ Documentation

**From docstring (attr/validators.py lines 688-705):**
```
A validator that composes multiple validators into one.

When called on a value, it runs all wrapped validators until one of them is
satisfied.

Raises:
    ValueError:
        If no validator is satisfied. Raised with a human-readable error
        message listing all the wrapped validators and the value that
        failed all of them.
```

**From online documentation (attrs.org):**
- The or_() validator composes multiple validators and attempts to satisfy at least one
- It runs all wrapped validators until one of them is satisfied
- If no validator is satisfied, it raises ValueError
- Example shows using it with instance_of and deep_iterable validators

### 2. What "satisfied" means

The documentation does NOT explicitly define what "satisfied" means, but from context and examples:
- A validator is "satisfied" when it doesn't raise an exception
- The documentation states: "The return value is _not_ inspected so the validator has to throw an exception itself"
- This implies that NOT raising an exception means the validator is satisfied

### 3. Exception Handling Specification

**Critical finding:** The documentation does NOT specify:
- What types of exceptions should be caught by or_
- Whether programming errors (NameError, AttributeError, etc.) should be caught
- That there's any difference in exception handling between or_ and and_

### 4. Validator Behavior Standards

From examining standard validators and documentation:
- Validators should raise exceptions to indicate validation failure
- Standard validators raise ValueError or TypeError for validation failures
- No documentation suggests validators should raise other exception types for validation
- No documentation suggests that programming errors should be caught

### 5. Consistency with and_ validator

**From and_ documentation:**
- Simply states it "runs all validators"
- No mention of exception handling
- Implementation shows it doesn't catch any exceptions

The documentation does NOT mention that or_ and and_ handle exceptions differently.

## Documentation Gaps

1. **Ambiguous "satisfied" definition**: The documentation doesn't explicitly state that "satisfied" means catching ALL exceptions vs only validation exceptions

2. **No exception type specification**: There's no documentation about which exception types indicate validation failure vs programming errors

3. **Inconsistency not documented**: The different exception handling between or_ and and_ is not mentioned

4. **Silent failure risk not mentioned**: The documentation doesn't warn that programming errors in validators will be silently ignored

## Conclusion

The documentation is INSUFFICIENT to determine whether catching all exceptions is intended behavior. However:

1. The documentation only mentions ValueError being raised by or_ itself
2. All standard validators only raise ValueError or TypeError
3. The and_ validator doesn't catch exceptions at all
4. There's no documentation suggesting programming errors should be caught

This suggests that catching ALL exceptions (including programming errors) is likely NOT the intended behavior, but rather an implementation oversight.
