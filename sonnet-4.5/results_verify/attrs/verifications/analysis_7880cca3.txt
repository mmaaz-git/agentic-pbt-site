## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Arguments Against:**
- The code implementation is correct and works as expected
- The validator correctly performs greater-than comparison
- No functional issue exists - only documentation is wrong
- Users relying on actual behavior (testing) will find it works correctly

**Arguments For:**
- Could be considered a bug in the broader sense if documentation is part of the product
- However, this is more accurately a documentation issue than a code bug

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments Against:**
- The report accurately identifies a real discrepancy
- The documentation is objectively wrong
- The issue is reproducible and verifiable

**Arguments For:**
- None - the report is clearly valid

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case
- The documentation error could mislead developers
- The fix is trivial (one word change)
- Documentation accuracy is important for a validation library

**Arguments For:**
- Could argue it's minor since the function name and behavior description are clear
- However, this would be a weak argument given how simple the fix is

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments Against:**
- Not requesting new functionality
- The code already works correctly
- Only requesting documentation correction

**Arguments For:**
- None - this is not a feature request

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments For:**
- The code performs correctly as a "greater than" validator
- The implementation uses the correct operator (`operator.gt`)
- The function name `gt` clearly indicates "greater than"
- The behavioral description in the docstring is correct ("smaller or equal to *val*" are rejected)
- Only the operator reference in the docstring is wrong
- This is purely a documentation error with no code changes needed
- The fix is a simple one-word change: `operator.ge` â†’ `operator.gt`
- Similar validators (lt, le, ge) have correct documentation

**Arguments Against:**
- None - this is clearly a documentation issue

### Final Assessment:
This is a clear case of DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The validator works correctly as a "greater than" validator, using `operator.gt` as it should. The only issue is that the docstring incorrectly references `operator.ge` instead of `operator.gt`. This appears to be a copy-paste error from the `ge` validator's documentation.
