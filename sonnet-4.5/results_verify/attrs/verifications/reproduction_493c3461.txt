REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the attrs `or_` validator. The bug report is accurate in its description.

## Test Cases Run

1. **Basic Reproduction Case**: I created a validator that raises AttributeError and combined it with a valid validator using `or_()`.

Result: The AttributeError was silently caught and converted to a generic ValueError saying "None of ... satisfied", confirming the bug.

2. **KeyError Test**: Tested with a validator that raises KeyError.

Result: Same behavior - the KeyError was caught and converted to ValueError.

3. **ValueError Test**: Tested with a validator that raises ValueError (expected exception type).

Result: Works as expected - ValueError is caught and the next validator in the chain is tried.

4. **TypeError Test**: Tested with a validator that raises TypeError (expected exception type).

Result: Works as expected - TypeError is caught and the next validator in the chain is tried.

## Code Examination

I examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/attrs_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/validators.py`:

Lines 671-678 show the `_OrValidator.__call__` method:
```python
def __call__(self, inst, attr, value):
    for v in self.validators:
        try:
            v(inst, attr, value)
        except Exception:  # noqa: BLE001, PERF203, S112
            continue
        else:
            return
```

The code catches `Exception` (line 675), which means ALL exceptions are caught, not just validation errors.

## Comparison with not_ Validator

The `not_` validator (line 631) has a default parameter `exc_types=(ValueError, TypeError)`, showing that these are the standard validation exception types in attrs.

## Effect of the Bug

1. **Hides Programming Errors**: If a validator has a bug (e.g., AttributeError from accessing a missing attribute), this error is hidden.

2. **Makes Debugging Harder**: Developers see "None of ... satisfied" instead of the actual error that occurred.

3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Other validators in attrs consistently raise either ValueError or TypeError for validation failures, but the `or_` validator catches everything.

## Linter Comments

The code includes linter suppressions: `# noqa: BLE001, PERF203, S112`
- BLE001: Blind except (catching Exception)
- S112: Try-except-continue pattern
- PERF203: Performance warning

These suppressions indicate the developers were aware this was problematic code.

## Conclusion

The bug is real and reproducible. The `or_` validator catches all exceptions instead of just validation exceptions (ValueError, TypeError), which hides bugs in custom validators and makes debugging significantly harder.
