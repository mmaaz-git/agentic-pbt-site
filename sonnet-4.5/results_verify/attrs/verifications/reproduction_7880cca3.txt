## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is a documentation error in the `attr.validators.gt` function.

### Test Results:

1. **Reproduction Script Output:**
   - The docstring clearly states: "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values."
   - However, inspection of the actual validator shows it uses `operator.gt`
   - The function correctly rejects value=10 when bound=10 (correct behavior for >)
   - The function correctly accepts value=11 when bound=10 (correct behavior for >)

2. **Hypothesis Test:**
   - The property-based test passes successfully
   - The test confirms that `gt` validator correctly uses strict greater-than comparison
   - Values equal to the bound are rejected (as they should be for >)
   - Values greater than the bound are accepted (as they should be for >)

3. **Source Code Examination:**
   Located in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/validators.py`:
   - Line 488: Docstring incorrectly states "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values"
   - Line 495: Implementation correctly uses `operator.gt`: `return _NumberValidator(val, ">", operator.gt)`

### Conclusion:
The bug report is accurate. There is a clear discrepancy between the documentation (which incorrectly mentions `operator.ge`) and the implementation (which correctly uses `operator.gt`). The validator's behavior is correct - it performs strict greater-than comparison. Only the documentation needs to be fixed.
