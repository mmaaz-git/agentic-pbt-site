## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for Each Category

#### BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- There is a clear mismatch between documentation and implementation
- The docstring states the wrong operator is being used
- This could mislead users about the function's behavior
- Other similar functions (lt, le, ge) have correct documentation

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- The actual functionality works correctly
- The implementation uses the right operator (operator.gt)
- It's only the documentation that's wrong, not the code behavior

#### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Not applicable - the bug report is accurate and verifiable

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The reported issue exists exactly as described
- The reproduction code works and demonstrates the issue
- The mismatch between documentation and implementation is real

#### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- It's just a documentation typo with no functional impact
- The actual behavior is correct and intuitive
- Users would likely understand the correct behavior from the function name

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Documentation accuracy is important for library users
- The issue has already been fixed upstream (April 2025)
- It's a trivial fix that improves clarity
- Incorrect documentation can waste developer time

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it SHOULD be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code performs correctly; only the documentation is wrong
- The implementation uses the correct operator (operator.gt)
- The function behaves as users would expect from its name
- The fix only requires changing the docstring, not any code
- This has already been identified and fixed upstream as a documentation issue
- The commit message explicitly calls it a "typo" and "copy-paste error"

**Why it might NOT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- No strong reasons against this categorization

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Not applicable - no new functionality is being requested

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The bug report is about fixing existing incorrect documentation
- No new features or behaviors are being requested
- The implementation already works as intended

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The code works correctly, using `operator.gt` as it should for a "greater than" validator. The docstring incorrectly states it uses `operator.ge`, which is a documentation error that has already been recognized and fixed in the upstream repository. The bug report is accurate and the suggested fix is correct.
