# Reproduction Analysis

## Bug Report Summary
The bug report claims that the docstring for `attr.validators.gt()` incorrectly states it uses `operator.ge` when it actually uses `operator.gt`.

## Reproduction Results

### 1. Property-Based Test Execution
I ran the provided Hypothesis-based test, which passed successfully. The test confirms that:
- Values greater than the bound (50) are accepted
- Values less than or equal to the bound are rejected with ValueError
- This behavior is consistent with using operator.gt (strict greater than)

### 2. Specific Example Execution
The reproduction example with bound=5 showed:
- value=6 was accepted (correct, as 6 > 5)
- value=5 was rejected with ValueError (correct, as 5 is NOT > 5)
- value=4 was rejected with ValueError (correct, as 4 is NOT > 5)

This confirms the actual behavior uses operator.gt (strict greater than), not operator.ge.

### 3. Source Code Verification
I examined the actual source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/validators.py`:

Line 488 (docstring): "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values."
Line 495 (implementation): `return _NumberValidator(val, ">", operator.gt)`

This confirms the discrepancy: the docstring says `operator.ge` but the implementation uses `operator.gt`.

## Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. The docstring contains an error - it claims to use `operator.ge` when the code actually uses `operator.gt`. The behavior of the function is correct (rejecting values <= bound), but the documentation is incorrect.
