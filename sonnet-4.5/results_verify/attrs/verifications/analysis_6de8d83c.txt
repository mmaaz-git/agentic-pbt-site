# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### 1. BUG
**Arguments For:**
- There is a clear discrepancy between documentation and implementation
- Users reading the documentation would get incorrect information

**Arguments Against:**
- The code itself works correctly
- This is not a functional bug, just a documentation issue
- The actual behavior matches what users would expect from a function named "gt()"

**Verdict:** Not a BUG - the code functions correctly

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The code behaves exactly as it should (gt uses operator.gt)
- The function name and description match the actual behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug report is factually correct about the documentation error
- There is indeed a mismatch that needs to be fixed

**Verdict:** Not INVALID - the report correctly identifies a real issue

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue it's a trivial typo that doesn't affect functionality
- Developers likely understand gt() means "greater than" regardless of docs

**Arguments Against:**
- Documentation accuracy is important for API contracts
- This could confuse new users or those relying on documentation
- It's an easy fix that improves clarity

**Verdict:** Not WONTFIX - documentation should be accurate

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- None - this isn't requesting new functionality

**Arguments Against:**
- The report is about fixing existing documentation, not adding features
- The functionality already exists and works correctly

**Verdict:** Not FEATURE_REQUEST

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The code performs correctly (strict greater-than comparison)
- The only issue is that the docstring says "operator.ge" instead of "operator.gt"
- The fix is purely textual - changing one word in documentation
- Both the function description and actual behavior are correct
- This is clearly a copy-paste error from the ge() validator's docs
- The bug report even provides the exact diff needed to fix it

**Arguments Against:**
- None - this is clearly a documentation issue

**Verdict:** DOCUMENTATION_FIX is the appropriate classification

## Final Recommendation

This should be classified as **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**.

The function works correctly, performing strict greater-than comparisons using operator.gt as expected. The only issue is that the docstring incorrectly claims it uses operator.ge, which appears to be a copy-paste error from the ge() validator's documentation. The fix is trivial and purely documentary - changing "operator.ge" to "operator.gt" in the docstring.
