## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **attrs.org Documentation**:
   - The online documentation at https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#validators shows the same error
   - States the validator uses `operator.ge` while describing a "greater than" validator
   - The example code shows correct behavior (rejecting values <= bound)

2. **GitHub Repository (Main Branch)**:
   - The current main branch at GitHub has already fixed this issue
   - Commit on April 8, 2025: "doc: fix typo in attrs.validators.gt's docstring: ge -> gt (#1423)"
   - The fix correctly changes the docstring from `operator.ge` to `operator.gt`
   - Commit message explicitly states this was a "copy-paste error"

3. **Local Installation (v25.3.0)**:
   - The installed version still contains the bug
   - The fix hasn't been included in the 25.3.0 release

### Documentation Intent vs Implementation

The implementation is clearly correct:
- Function name `gt()` means "greater than"
- Uses `operator.gt` which is the "greater than" operator
- Validates that values are greater than the bound
- Error message says values must be ">" the bound

The documentation is clearly wrong:
- Claims to use `operator.ge` (greater than or equal)
- This would be inconsistent with the function's name and purpose
- All other comparison validators have matching documentation and implementation

### Conclusion
This is a legitimate documentation bug that has already been recognized and fixed upstream. The documentation should match the implementation, stating that `operator.gt` is used, not `operator.ge`. The bug exists in the currently installed version (25.3.0) but has been fixed in the main branch.
