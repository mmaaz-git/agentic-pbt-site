## Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The behavior contradicts reasonable expectations from the documentation
- Users implementing value_serializer following the docs will experience crashes
- The documentation explicitly says the hook "receives the current instance, field and value" without mentioning these can be None
- This is a functional issue that affects real-world usage of the API
- The fix is straightforward (update documentation or change implementation)

**Arguments Against:**
- The code works as designed internally
- Some users might argue None values are implied for non-attrs objects
- The feature was added in version 20.3.0 and may have always worked this way

**Verdict:** WEAK - While technically a bug, it's more of a documentation issue

### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The code works as implemented
- Passing None for non-attrs values could be considered "obvious" behavior
- Users should defensively code for None values in callbacks

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation clearly states what parameters are received without caveats
- It's not reasonable to expect users to guess that parameters can be None
- The crash is a direct result of following the documentation

**Verdict:** NO - The report accurately identifies a real issue

### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Changing the implementation would be a breaking change
- Some existing code might rely on None values to distinguish non-attrs values
- The workaround (checking for None) is simple

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects common usage patterns
- The issue causes actual crashes in reasonable user code
- Documentation fixes don't require breaking changes

**Verdict:** NO - This is not a trivial issue to ignore

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The code behaves consistently and as designed
- The issue is purely that documentation doesn't match implementation
- Updating documentation is non-breaking and solves the problem
- Users can work around this once they know about it
- The proposed fix in the bug report is a documentation update

**Arguments Against:**
- One could argue the implementation should change to match documentation
- Some might consider this a code bug rather than documentation bug

**Verdict:** STRONG - This is primarily a documentation issue

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- One could argue for a new parameter to control None behavior
- Could request better error messages when None is encountered

**Arguments Against:**
- The functionality already exists, it's just not documented properly
- This isn't asking for new functionality, just accurate documentation
- The bug report isn't requesting new features

**Verdict:** NO - This is about existing functionality

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. The reasons are:

1. The implementation is consistent and deliberate - it passes None for non-attrs values
2. The behavior makes some sense (distinguishing attrs from non-attrs values)
3. The issue is that users following the documentation will write broken code
4. The fix is to update the documentation to accurately describe the actual behavior
5. The bug reporter even suggests a documentation fix as the solution
6. Changing the implementation would be a breaking change for existing users

The documentation needs to clearly state that `inst` and `field` parameters can be None when processing nested non-attrs values, and should include examples showing how to handle this case properly.
