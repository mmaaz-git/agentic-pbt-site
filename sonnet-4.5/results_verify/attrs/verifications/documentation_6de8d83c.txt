# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### 1. Published Documentation (attrs.org)
The official documentation at https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html also contains the same error. It states that `attrs.validators.gt()` "uses operator.ge to compare the values," which is inconsistent with what the function actually does.

### 2. Function Description
Both the source code docstring and the online documentation correctly describe the behavior:
- "A validator that raises ValueError if the initializer is called with a number smaller or equal to val"
- This description accurately describes a "greater than" (>) comparison, not "greater than or equal" (>=)

### 3. Comparison with Related Functions
Looking at the ge() validator for context:
- ge() at line 473: "The validator uses `operator.ge` to compare the values." (correct)
- ge() at line 480: `return _NumberValidator(val, ">=", operator.ge)` (implementation matches docs)

The pattern shows that ge() correctly documents using operator.ge, while gt() incorrectly claims to use operator.ge when it uses operator.gt.

### 4. Expected Behavior
The function name "gt" clearly indicates "greater than" which should use operator.gt. The actual implementation is correct, performing strict greater-than comparison as expected from the function name and description.

## Documentation Errors Found
1. Source code docstring at line 488: Claims to use operator.ge instead of operator.gt
2. Official online documentation: Repeats the same error

## Conclusion
This is a documentation error. The code behaves correctly (using operator.gt for strict greater-than comparison), but the documentation incorrectly states it uses operator.ge. This appears to be a copy-paste error from the ge() validator's documentation.
