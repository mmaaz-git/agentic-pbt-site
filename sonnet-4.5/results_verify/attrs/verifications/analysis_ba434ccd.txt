## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:

**Arguments For:**
1. The behavior violates the principle of least surprise - users expect unchanged fields to remain identical
2. It causes silent data corruption with non-idempotent converters
3. The behavior makes `evolve()` unsafe for common use cases (e.g., normalization converters like `str.lower`)
4. The bug report correctly identifies a real issue that affects data integrity
5. Many users would consider this behavior incorrect based on the function's purpose

**Arguments Against:**
1. The behavior is consistent with Python 3.13's `copy.replace()`
2. GitHub issue #1126 is labeled as "Feature" not "Bug", suggesting maintainers view this as working as designed
3. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that converters won't re-run
4. The implementation consistently applies the same initialization logic for all fields

### Consideration for INVALID:

**Arguments For:**
1. The documentation never explicitly states that converters won't re-run for unchanged fields
2. The behavior is consistent with how the class constructor works
3. Python's own `copy.replace()` exhibits the same behavior
4. The implementation is internally consistent - it treats all fields the same way

**Arguments Against:**
1. The behavior causes actual data corruption
2. Users have a reasonable expectation that "evolve" means "change only what's specified"
3. The issue has been acknowledged by the community as problematic (GitHub issue #1126)
4. The behavior makes common converter patterns unsafe

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:

**Arguments For:**
1. GitHub issue #1126 is already labeled as a "Feature" request by maintainers
2. The current behavior might be intentional, and changing it would be an enhancement
3. The documentation doesn't promise this behavior, so adding it would be a new feature
4. Supporting converter bypass for unchanged fields would be adding new functionality

**Arguments Against:**
1. This seems more like fixing incorrect behavior than adding a new feature
2. Users already expect this behavior based on the function's purpose
3. The current behavior causes data corruption, which is more bug than missing feature

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:

**Arguments For:**
1. The documentation should clearly warn about this behavior with converters
2. Best practices for writing idempotent converters should be documented
3. The interaction between `evolve()` and converters needs explicit documentation
4. Users need to know this limitation to write safe code

**Arguments Against:**
1. The core issue is the behavior itself, not just the documentation
2. Documenting problematic behavior doesn't fix the underlying issue
3. The bug report correctly identifies a behavioral problem, not a documentation issue

### Consideration for WONTFIX:

**Arguments For:**
1. The behavior is consistent with Python's `copy.replace()`
2. Changing it might break existing code that relies on converters re-running
3. Users can work around it by writing idempotent converters
4. The issue has been open since April 2023 without a fix

**Arguments Against:**
1. The behavior causes real data corruption issues
2. It's not an obscure edge case - it affects any non-idempotent converter
3. The workaround (idempotent converters) isn't always practical
4. The issue significantly limits the usefulness of `evolve()`

### Final Assessment:

This is a **FEATURE_REQUEST** because:

1. **Maintainer Intent**: The GitHub issue #1126 tracking this exact problem is labeled as "Feature", indicating the maintainers view the current behavior as working as designed

2. **Documentation Ambiguity**: The documentation never promises that converters won't re-run. Without an explicit contract being violated, changing the behavior is an enhancement rather than a bug fix

3. **Consistency with Python**: The behavior matches Python 3.13's `copy.replace()`, suggesting this might be an intentional design choice for consistency

4. **Not a Clear Bug**: While the behavior is problematic and surprising, it's internally consistent - the implementation treats all fields uniformly by passing them through the constructor

5. **Enhancement Nature**: Adding logic to bypass converters for unchanged fields would be adding new, more sophisticated functionality rather than fixing broken functionality

The fact that this causes data corruption with non-idempotent converters is unfortunate, but without explicit documentation stating the expected behavior, this is best classified as a missing feature that should be added to make `evolve()` more useful and safe.
