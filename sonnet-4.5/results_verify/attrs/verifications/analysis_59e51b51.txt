Bug Report Category Analysis
=============================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug)
------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Clear API contract violation: or_() doesn't follow the exception format established in v22.1.0
- Inconsistent behavior: All other validators pass structured data, or_() only passes a message
- Real impact: Prevents programmatic error handling that works with other validators
- Post-standardization addition: or_() was added in v24.1.0, after the v22.1.0 standardization
- Pattern violation: Every other validator examined (in_(), instance_of(), not_(), matches_re()) follows the pattern
- The fix is straightforward and matches existing patterns

Arguments AGAINST:
- The or_() documentation doesn't explicitly promise structured exception data
- The validator still works functionally (validates correctly)

2. INVALID
----------
Arguments FOR:
- The or_() documentation doesn't explicitly promise the structured format
- Could argue this is just "less useful" rather than "wrong"

Arguments AGAINST:
- There's a clear, established API pattern that or_() violates
- The v22.1.0 release explicitly standardized exception formats
- This is not about exception types but about exception content/structure
- The inconsistency is objectively verifiable

3. WONTFIX
----------
Arguments FOR:
- The validator still functions correctly for validation
- Users can still catch and handle the exception
- The error message is still human-readable

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not a trivial issue - it breaks programmatic error handling
- The inconsistency affects API usability
- Other validators were explicitly updated in v22.1.0 to fix this exact issue

4. FEATURE_REQUEST
------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could frame this as "requesting enhanced error information"
- The or_() validator never promised this feature

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is fixing a deviation from an established pattern, not adding new functionality
- The v22.1.0 release treated this as a bug fix for other validators
- API consistency is a bug, not a feature

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
-------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The or_() documentation could be updated to match its current behavior
- Could document that or_() is an exception to the standard pattern

Arguments AGAINST:
- The code behavior is the problem, not the documentation
- Documenting an inconsistency doesn't fix the API contract violation
- Other validators had their code fixed in v22.1.0, not their documentation changed

CONCLUSION
----------
This is clearly a BUG. The or_() validator violates an established API pattern that was explicitly standardized in v22.1.0. The fact that or_() was added AFTER this standardization (in v24.1.0) makes this an oversight in implementation rather than a legacy compatibility issue. The bug has real impact on code that programmatically handles validator exceptions, and the fix is straightforward - making or_() consistent with every other validator in the library.
