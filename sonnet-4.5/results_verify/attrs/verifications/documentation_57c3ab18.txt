Documentation Analysis for attrs evolve() Function
===================================================

## Official Documentation Review

### attrs.evolve() Documentation (from attrs.org)
The official documentation states:
- evolve() creates a new instance based on an existing instance with specified changes
- It creates a new instance using __init__
- Validators will run on the new values during initialization
- Private attributes should be specified without leading underscores
- Attributes with init=False cannot be set

### Critical Finding: No Mention of Converter Behavior
The documentation does NOT specify:
1. How converters are handled when fields are unchanged
2. Whether converters should be re-applied to already-converted values
3. Any requirement that converters must be idempotent

### Implementation Analysis (from source code review)
From attr/_make.py lines 610-618:
- evolve() retrieves current attribute values using getattr()
- These values are already converted (post-converter values)
- It passes these values to cls(**changes), which runs __init__
- __init__ runs converters again on all values

### Design Intent vs Implementation
From the docstring analysis and implementation:
- evolve() is DESIGNED to go through __init__ (this is documented)
- However, there's no documentation stating that converters will be re-applied to unchanged fields
- The documentation implies evolve() creates a modified copy, suggesting unchanged fields should remain unchanged

## Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation doesn't warn users that converters must be idempotent when using evolve()
2. There's no mention that evolve() will re-apply converters to unchanged fields
3. The behavior with converters is completely undocumented

## Conclusion

The documentation is insufficient regarding converter behavior with evolve(). A reasonable user would expect that:
- evolve(obj) without changes produces an identical copy
- Converters are only applied to explicitly changed values
- Unchanged fields retain their current values without modification

The current implementation violates these reasonable expectations without any documentation warning users of this behavior.
