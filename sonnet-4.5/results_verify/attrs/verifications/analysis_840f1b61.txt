## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for BUG Classification

**Arguments For:**
1. **Violates Python's Fundamental Contract**: The behavior violates Python's documented requirement that equal objects must have equal hash values. This is not a minor issue but a violation of a core Python invariant.

2. **Causes Real Problems**: This isn't theoretical - it causes actual failures in dictionaries and sets where equal objects are treated as distinct, breaking expected Python behavior.

3. **Silent Failure**: The issue fails silently, allowing corrupted data structures without any warning or error. Users may not realize their code is broken until much later.

4. **Documentation Discourages This**: The attrs documentation itself says setting hash to anything other than None (mirroring eq) is "discouraged" and that mirroring eq is "the correct behavior according to the Python spec."

5. **Easy to Accidentally Trigger**: A developer might reasonably set `eq=False` on a field they don't want in equality comparisons and `hash=True` thinking they want it in the hash, not realizing this breaks Python's contract.

### Consideration for INVALID Classification

**Arguments Against:**
1. **Not explicitly forbidden**: The attrs library doesn't explicitly prevent this combination or raise an error.

2. **User responsibility**: One could argue users should understand Python's hash/equality contract and not create invalid configurations.

### Consideration for WONTFIX Classification

**Arguments Against:**
1. **Not a trivial issue**: This violates a fundamental Python invariant and causes real bugs in production code.

2. **Not an obscure edge case**: Using eq and hash parameters is a common use case for attrs users.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST Classification

**Arguments Against:**
1. **This is a bug, not a missing feature**: The current behavior violates Python's documented requirements. Adding validation would be fixing a bug, not adding a new feature.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification

**Arguments For:**
1. **Documentation already discourages this**: The documentation does say this is discouraged and incorrect per Python spec.

**Arguments Against:**
1. **The code allows broken behavior**: Even if documentation warns against it, the library shouldn't allow configurations that violate Python's fundamental contracts.

2. **Documentation isn't clear enough**: While it says setting hash != None is "discouraged", it doesn't explicitly warn about the specific `eq=False, hash=True` combination or its consequences.

### Final Assessment

This should be classified as **BUG** because:

1. **Violates Python's Core Contract**: This isn't about attrs-specific behavior but about violating Python's fundamental requirement that equal objects have equal hashes.

2. **Causes Real Bugs**: This leads to actual failures in dictionaries, sets, and other hash-based data structures.

3. **Library Should Prevent Invalid States**: A well-designed library should prevent users from creating objects that violate language invariants. Just as attrs already validates that `eq=False` and `order=True` is invalid, it should validate this combination too.

4. **Documentation Acknowledges Incorrectness**: The documentation itself states that not mirroring eq is incorrect per Python spec, yet the library allows it.

5. **Simple Fix Available**: The bug report provides a straightforward fix that would prevent this invalid configuration, similar to existing validation in the library.

The fact that the library allows a configuration its own documentation calls incorrect and that violates Python's fundamental invariants makes this a clear bug that should be fixed, not just documented better.
