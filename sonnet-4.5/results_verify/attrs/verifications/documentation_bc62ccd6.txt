DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS: attr.validators.or_
============================================

## Documentation Found

### Official Docstring (validators.py, lines 687-705)
```python
def or_(*validators):
    """
    A validator that composes multiple validators into one.

    When called on a value, it runs all wrapped validators until one of them is
    satisfied.

    Args:
        validators (~collections.abc.Iterable[typing.Callable]):
            Arbitrary number of validators.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If no validator is satisfied. Raised with a human-readable error
            message listing all the wrapped validators and the value that
            failed all of them.

    .. versionadded:: 24.1.0
    """
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **What the documentation SAYS**:
   - Runs validators until one is "satisfied"
   - Only mentions raising ValueError when NO validator is satisfied
   - Does not specify what "satisfied" means
   - Does not document exception handling behavior

2. **What the documentation DOESN'T SAY**:
   - No mention of catching ALL exceptions
   - No specification of what exceptions from child validators are caught
   - No mention that programming errors will be suppressed
   - No comparison with similar validators' behavior

3. **Ambiguity in "satisfied"**:
   The documentation says validators run "until one of them is satisfied" but doesn't define what "satisfied" means:
   - Does it mean "doesn't raise an exception"?
   - Does it mean "doesn't raise a validation error"?
   - The implementation interprets it as "doesn't raise ANY exception"

## Comparison with Related Validators' Documentation

### not_() validator documentation (lines 631-659):
```python
def not_(validator, *, msg=None, exc_types=(ValueError, TypeError)):
    """
    ...
    exc_types (tuple[type, ...]):
        Exception type(s) to capture. Other types raised by child
        validators will not be intercepted and pass through.
    ...
    """
```

The not_() validator EXPLICITLY documents:
- Which exceptions it captures (ValueError, TypeError by default)
- That it's configurable via exc_types parameter
- That "Other types raised by child validators will not be intercepted and pass through"

### and_() validator documentation (lines 3043-3053):
```python
def and_(*validators):
    """
    A validator that composes multiple validators into one.

    When called on a value, it runs all wrapped validators.
    ...
    """
```

The and_() validator doesn't mention exception handling because it doesn't catch any - exceptions propagate naturally.

## Documentation Assessment

### Is the behavior documented?
**NO** - The documentation does not state that or_() catches ALL exceptions. This is a critical behavior that should be documented.

### Is the documentation misleading?
**PARTIALLY** - The documentation only mentions raising ValueError, which could lead users to believe that's the only exception behavior to consider. It doesn't warn that programming errors in validators will be silently suppressed.

### Is this expected behavior based on the documentation?
**NO** - A reasonable developer reading this documentation would NOT expect:
1. That NameError, AttributeError, and other programming errors would be caught
2. That their buggy validators would be silently ignored
3. That the behavior differs significantly from not_() which explicitly limits exception catching

### Comparison with Python idioms
Python's general philosophy (from PEP 20 - The Zen of Python):
- "Errors should never pass silently."
- "Unless explicitly silenced."

The or_() documentation does NOT explicitly state that all errors will be silenced, violating this principle.

## Conclusion

The documentation is INSUFFICIENT and does not accurately describe the actual behavior. The critical fact that ALL exceptions (including programming errors) are caught is completely undocumented. This is not a documentation bug alone - the behavior itself is problematic and inconsistent with:
1. Other validators in the same library
2. Python best practices
3. Reasonable developer expectations
