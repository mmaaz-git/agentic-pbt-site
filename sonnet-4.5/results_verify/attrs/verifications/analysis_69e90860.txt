BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

CONSIDERING BUG:
✓ This is a valid bug - there are clear typos in an error message
✓ The typos are: "define" → "defined" and "is order" → "in order"
✓ These are grammatical errors in user-facing text
✓ The functionality is correct, only the text is wrong
✓ This affects user experience and professionalism

CONSIDERING INVALID:
✗ The bug report is accurate - the typos exist exactly as reported
✗ The test code works correctly and demonstrates the issue
✗ This is not about undocumented behavior - error message quality is expected

CONSIDERING WONTFIX:
✗ This is not an obscure edge case - any user who forgets eq will see this
✗ The typos are obvious grammatical errors, not style choices
✗ Fixing typos in user-facing messages is standard maintenance
? Could argue it's trivial, but error messages are important for developer experience

CONSIDERING DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
✗ This is not a documentation issue - the code has typos, not the docs
✗ The error message itself is the problem, not how it's documented
✗ No documentation claims the error message should have these typos

CONSIDERING FEATURE_REQUEST:
✗ This is not asking for new functionality
✗ The error handling already exists and works correctly
✗ This is fixing existing text, not adding features
? Could argue "better error messages" but typo fixes are bugs, not features

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- Low severity (as stated in report) - doesn't affect functionality
- But still worth fixing as it affects professional appearance
- Error messages are part of the user interface

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is clearly a BUG. The error message contains obvious typos that should be fixed.
While low severity, it's a legitimate issue that affects the quality of the library.
The fix is trivial and risk-free (just correcting spelling/grammar in a string).
