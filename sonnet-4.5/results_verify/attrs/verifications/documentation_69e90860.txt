DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
The cmp_using function documentation states:
- "The resulting class will have a full set of ordering methods if at least one of {lt, le, gt, ge} and eq are provided."
- This confirms that eq is required when using partial ordering functions

PYTHON FUNCTOOLS DEPENDENCY:
- The code uses functools.total_ordering which requires __eq__ to be defined
- This is a Python standard library requirement, not an attrs-specific requirement
- The comment in the code (lines 103-104) explicitly mentions this:
  "functools.total_ordering requires __eq__ to be defined, so raise early error here to keep a nice stack."

ERROR MESSAGE PURPOSE:
- The error message is meant to inform users that eq is required when providing partial ordering functions
- This is a legitimate technical requirement, not arbitrary
- The functionality itself is correct - only the error message text has typos

DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY:
- The documentation doesn't specify the exact error message text
- Error message quality is an implicit expectation for professional software
- The typos don't affect functionality but do affect user experience

CONCLUSION:
The documentation supports that ValueError should be raised when eq is missing with partial ordering.
The typos in the error message are not documented behavior - they are clearly mistakes in the string literal.
