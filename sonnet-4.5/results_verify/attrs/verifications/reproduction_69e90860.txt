BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in attrs.cmp_using.

TEST EXECUTION:
- The provided test code runs successfully and catches the ValueError with the typo
- The error message when calling cmp_using(lt=lambda a, b: a < b) is:
  "eq must be define is order to complete ordering from lt, le, gt, ge."

VERIFICATION IN SOURCE CODE:
- Located the error in /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/attrs_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/attr/_cmp.py
- Line 105 contains the exact typo reported:
  msg = "eq must be define is order to complete ordering from lt, le, gt, ge."

TYPOS CONFIRMED:
1. "define" should be "defined" (missing 'd')
2. "is order" should be "in order" (missing 'n')

EXISTING TEST CONFIRMATION:
- The existing test file test_cmp_using_properties.py line 188 actually expects this typo
- Test: with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="eq must be define")
- This shows the typo has been in the codebase and tests were written to match it

The bug is real and affects the quality of error messages shown to users.
