Bug Report Analysis: attrs evolve() Double-Applies Converters
==============================================================

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The behavior clearly violates the principle of least surprise: evolve(obj) should produce an identical copy
- Non-idempotent converters suffer from silent data corruption
- The implementation demonstrably double-applies converters to unchanged fields
- No documentation warns users about this behavior
- The bug report correctly identifies the root cause in the source code
- This is a logic error that produces incorrect results for valid use cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- One could argue that converters should always be idempotent (but this is not documented)
- The implementation consistently goes through __init__ as documented

**Assessment:** STRONG case for BUG

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug is reproducible and the behavior is clearly incorrect

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The test cases run correctly and demonstrate the issue
- The problem is real and affects non-idempotent converters
- The analysis of the source code is accurate

**Assessment:** NOT INVALID

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Fixing this properly would require significant refactoring
- Users can work around it by using idempotent converters
- The bug only affects non-idempotent converters, which might be considered edge cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - converters are a core feature of attrs
- Non-idempotent converters are legitimate (e.g., incrementing counters, adding timestamps)
- Silent data corruption is a serious issue that shouldn't be ignored
- The workaround (idempotent converters) is a significant limitation

**Assessment:** WEAK case for WONTFIX

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be updated to warn users about this behavior
- Could document that converters must be idempotent when using evolve()
- The code behavior is consistent, just unexpected

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not just a documentation issue - the code behavior is incorrect
- Documenting a bug doesn't make it not a bug
- Users reasonably expect evolve(obj) to produce an identical copy

**Assessment:** Could be partial solution but doesn't address the core issue

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could argue that proper handling of converters in evolve() is a new feature
- The current implementation never promised to handle non-idempotent converters

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not requesting new functionality - it's reporting broken existing functionality
- evolve() already exists and should work correctly
- The expectation that evolve(obj) produces an identical copy is fundamental

**Assessment:** NOT a feature request

## Final Analysis

This is clearly a BUG. The current implementation of evolve() incorrectly double-applies converters to unchanged fields, causing:

1. **Data corruption**: Non-idempotent converters produce incorrect values
2. **Violation of expectations**: evolve(obj) != obj for unchanged objects
3. **Undocumented behavior**: No warning about this limitation exists
4. **Logical inconsistency**: Converters should only apply to new input values, not already-converted values

The bug report is well-written, correctly identifies the root cause, and provides clear reproduction cases. While fixing it may require refactoring, the current behavior is definitively incorrect and should be addressed.

The fact that idempotent converters mask the issue doesn't make it not a bug - many legitimate use cases require non-idempotent converters (counters, timestamps, unique ID generation, cumulative transformations, etc.).
