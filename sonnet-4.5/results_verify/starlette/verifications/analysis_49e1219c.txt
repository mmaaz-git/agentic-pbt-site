## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code has a clear inconsistency between the assertion logic (line 98) and the conditional logic (line 100)
- The assertion uses `bool(directory)` while the conditional uses `directory is not None`
- This causes incorrect behavior where an empty sequence causes the code to create a new environment instead of using the provided one
- The bug report's reproduction is valid and demonstrates the incorrect behavior
- The fix is straightforward and logical - making the conditional consistent with the assertion

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None - this is clearly a bug in the implementation

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug is reproducible and the logic error is evident

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug report correctly identifies an inconsistency in the code
- The reproduction test cases work as described
- The behavior violates the intent expressed by the assertion

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could argue that users shouldn't pass empty sequences as directory parameters

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a logical inconsistency in the code
- The assertion explicitly handles this case correctly (by using truthiness)
- Users might legitimately have code that conditionally builds a directory list that could be empty
- The fix is simple and doesn't break any existing valid usage

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - this is not asking for new functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code already has an assertion that expresses the intended behavior
- This is fixing existing broken behavior, not adding new features

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state what happens with empty sequences

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code has a clear bug - it's not just a documentation issue
- The assertion message already documents the intent: "either 'directory' or 'env' arguments must be passed"
- The type hints via @overload show that you should provide either directory OR env, not both
- Fixing the documentation wouldn't solve the actual code bug

### Final Assessment
This is a **BUG**. The code has a clear logic error where:
1. The assertion correctly uses truthiness to check if directory is provided
2. The conditional incorrectly uses `is not None` check
3. This causes the code to behave incorrectly when empty sequences are provided with a valid env

The bug is:
- Reproducible
- Has a clear root cause
- Has a simple fix
- Violates the intent expressed by the assertion
- Not an unreasonable edge case
