REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the ProgressBar class from django.core.serializers.base.

## Bug Details:

1. The bug occurs in the ProgressBar.update() method at line 59 of base.py
2. The exact line causing the issue is:
   perc = count * 100 // self.total_count

3. When total_count is 0, this line causes a ZeroDivisionError

## Reproduction Results:

1. **Hypothesis Property-Based Test**: FAILED
   - The test fails with ZeroDivisionError when any positive count value (1-100) is passed to update()
   - This confirms the bug exists for all positive integer inputs when total_count=0

2. **Simple Reproducer**: FAILED
   - Creating a ProgressBar with total_count=0 and calling update(1) immediately triggers ZeroDivisionError
   - Stack trace confirms the error occurs at line 59 in the update() method

3. **Contextual Testing**: MIXED
   - An empty queryset (list) doesn't trigger the bug on its own because enumerate() never yields any items
   - However, if update() is manually called with any positive count when total_count=0, it crashes
   - This suggests the bug could occur in edge cases where update() might be called even with total_count=0

## Effect of the Bug:

The bug causes a complete crash with ZeroDivisionError whenever:
- A ProgressBar is initialized with total_count=0
- AND the update() method is called with any positive count value

This prevents the serializer from handling certain edge cases gracefully, particularly when dealing with empty querysets or when object_count is explicitly set to 0.

The bug report accurately describes the issue and provides correct reproduction code.
