BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION
--------------------------------
The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report was executed successfully. The test failed as expected with the specific example:
- Input: origin=':', spaces_after=1
- Result: AssertionError - Got 400 status code instead of expected 200
- Config: allow_origins=[': '] (with trailing space)
- Request: origin=':' (without space)

2. SIMPLE EXAMPLE REPRODUCTION
-------------------------------
Three test cases were executed:

Test 1 - Trailing space:
- Configuration: allow_origins=['http://example.com '] (with trailing space)
- Request origin: 'http://example.com' (no space)
- Result: Status 400 (FAILED - expected 200)

Test 2 - Leading space:
- Configuration: allow_origins=[' http://example.com'] (with leading space)
- Request origin: 'http://example.com' (no space)
- Result: Status 400 (FAILED - expected 200)

Test 3 - Control (no spaces):
- Configuration: allow_origins=['http://example.com'] (no spaces)
- Request origin: 'http://example.com' (no spaces)
- Result: Status 200 (PASSED - as expected)

3. CODE ANALYSIS
----------------
Examined the source code at:
/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/starlette_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/cors.py

Key findings:
- Line 65: self.allow_origins = allow_origins (stored as-is without normalization)
- Line 67: self.allow_headers = [h.lower() for h in allow_headers] (headers ARE normalized)
- Line 102: return origin in self.allow_origins (exact string matching)

The code shows inconsistent normalization:
- Headers are normalized (lowercased) on line 67
- Headers are also stripped on line 129
- Origins are NOT normalized at all on line 65

4. EFFECT OF THE BUG
--------------------
When developers configure CORS middleware with origin URLs that accidentally contain whitespace (e.g., from configuration files, environment variables, or copy-paste errors), valid CORS requests from browsers will be rejected with 400 errors. This happens because:

1. The middleware stores the origins with whitespace intact
2. Browsers send origin headers without whitespace (per spec)
3. The exact string comparison fails
4. Valid requests are incorrectly rejected

This is particularly problematic because:
- The whitespace is often invisible to developers
- The error message doesn't indicate the whitespace issue
- It works fine when there's no whitespace
- Other parameters like headers ARE normalized, creating inconsistency
