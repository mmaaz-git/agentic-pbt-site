## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category

**BUG (Valid Bug Report):**
- **For**: The code violates a clearly defined specification (PEP 3333 and RFC 3875). Both specs explicitly state SERVER_PORT must be a string, but Starlette sets it as an integer.
- **For**: This is a contract violation that could cause real compatibility issues with WSGI applications expecting string types.
- **For**: The fix is straightforward (convert to string) and the bug is well-documented with reproducible test cases.
- **Against**: The middleware is deprecated, which might suggest lower priority.

**WONTFIX:**
- **For**: The middleware is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Users are already being directed to use an alternative (a2wsgi).
- **For**: Since it's deprecated, investing time in fixing it might not be worthwhile.
- **Against**: As long as the code is part of Starlette, it should work correctly. Deprecation doesn't mean it should be broken.
- **Against**: The fix is trivial (adding str() conversion), so the effort required is minimal.

**INVALID:**
- **For**: None - the bug is real and violates documented specifications.
- **Against**: The specifications are clear, the bug is reproducible, and the expected behavior is well-defined.

**DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- **For**: Could argue that Starlette should document this deviation from the WSGI spec.
- **Against**: This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue. The code claims to implement WSGI but doesn't follow the spec.

**FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- **For**: None - this is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality.
- **Against**: The WSGI spec already defines this behavior; it's not a new feature.

### Key Considerations

1. **Specification Compliance**: The WSGI specification (PEP 3333) and CGI specification (RFC 3875) both clearly require SERVER_PORT to be a string. This is not ambiguous.

2. **Real-World Impact**: WSGI applications that perform string operations on SERVER_PORT or make type assumptions based on the spec will fail with Starlette's implementation.

3. **Trivial Fix**: The fix is a one-line change (adding str() conversion), making the cost-benefit ratio favorable even for deprecated code.

4. **User Experience**: Users still using this middleware (before migration) should have correct behavior. Deprecation is not an excuse for incorrect implementation.

5. **Standards Compliance**: When implementing a standard protocol (WSGI), adherence to the specification is critical for interoperability.

### Recommendation

This should be categorized as **BUG**. While the middleware is deprecated, it still exists in the codebase and claims to implement the WSGI specification. The violation is clear, well-documented, and could cause real issues for users. The fix is trivial and would ensure correct behavior for users still using this middleware before they migrate to alternatives.
