## Documentation Analysis

### Starlette Documentation
I reviewed the official Starlette documentation for the Middleware class:
- The documentation does not specify any requirements or expectations for the `__repr__` method
- There is no mention of how the Middleware class should be represented as a string
- The documentation focuses on functionality and usage patterns, not internal implementation details

### Python __repr__ Conventions
Based on Python best practices and conventions research:

1. **Core Principle**: The `__repr__` method should provide an unambiguous representation of the object's state

2. **Syntactic Validity**:
   - The output should ideally be syntactically valid Python code
   - The string should look like a valid Python expression that could recreate the object
   - While not always achievable (e.g., for complex objects), syntactic validity is a strong convention

3. **Format Convention**:
   - Should follow the pattern: `ClassName(arg1=value1, arg2=value2)`
   - The representation should include the class name and constructor arguments

4. **eval(repr(obj)) Idiom**:
   - While not mandatory, it's a common guideline that `eval(repr(obj))` should ideally recreate the object
   - At minimum, the repr should be syntactically valid even if not fully eval-able

5. **Developer-Focused**:
   - `__repr__` is intended for developers and debugging
   - Should provide clear, unambiguous information about the object's state

### Analysis of the Bug Against Documentation

The bug violates Python conventions because:

1. **Syntactic Invalidity**: The output `Middleware(, 123, kwarg='test')` is not valid Python syntax due to the leading comma

2. **Breaks Standard Format**: The leading comma breaks the expected format pattern for repr strings

3. **Not Eval-able**: The invalid syntax means `eval(repr(middleware))` would raise a SyntaxError

4. **Unclear Representation**: The empty first argument with a comma is confusing and doesn't clearly represent the object's state

### Conclusion
While Starlette's documentation doesn't explicitly specify `__repr__` behavior, the current implementation violates well-established Python conventions for `__repr__` methods by producing syntactically invalid output. This is a legitimate bug based on Python's standard practices, even without explicit Starlette documentation requirements.
