DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

HTTP Specification (RFC 7232):
-------------------------------
According to RFC 7232 Section 2.3.2, ETags must be compared using the "weak comparison function" for If-None-Match processing:

"A recipient MUST use the weak comparison function when comparing entity-tags for If-None-Match, since weak entity-tags can be used for cache validation even if there have been changes to the representation data."

The weak comparison function states: "two entity-tags are equivalent if their opaque-tags match character-by-character, regardless of either or both being tagged as 'weak'."

This means:
- W/"123" should match W/"123" ✓
- W/"123" should match "123" ✓
- "123" should match "123" ✓
- W/"123" should NOT match W/"456" ✓

Starlette Documentation:
------------------------
The Starlette documentation for StaticFiles does not explicitly document the `is_not_modified()` method or its ETag handling behavior. However, since Starlette aims to be a standards-compliant ASGI framework, it should follow HTTP specifications.

Conclusion:
-----------
The current implementation violates RFC 7232 by failing to properly implement weak ETag comparison. The bug report correctly identifies that:

1. Weak ETags with identical values should match (W/"123" == W/"123")
2. Weak and strong ETags with identical quoted values should match (W/"123" == "123")
3. The current code fails both of these requirements

The documentation doesn't specify any custom ETag handling that would override the HTTP standard, so the implementation should follow RFC 7232.
