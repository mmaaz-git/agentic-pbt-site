BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
=========================

## Considering INVALID
Why it might be INVALID:
- One could argue that URLPath is meant for internal use by the routing system
- The routing system always generates paths with leading "/"

Why it's NOT INVALID:
- URLPath is a public API class in starlette.datastructures
- The constructor accepts any string without validation
- No documentation states paths must start with "/"
- The bug produces objectively incorrect URLs ('/apitest' instead of '/api/test')
- This is not about unclear behavior but clearly wrong concatenation

## Considering WONTFIX
Why it might be WONTFIX:
- It could be considered an edge case since most users get URLPath from routing
- Internal starlette usage always has paths starting with "/"

Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
- This is not an obscure edge case - relative paths are common
- The fix is simple and straightforward
- The bug produces malformed URLs which is a serious issue
- URLPath is a public API that users can instantiate directly

## Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Supporting relative paths could be seen as a new feature
- The original design might have intended only absolute paths

Why it's NOT a FEATURE_REQUEST:
- The code already accepts relative paths without error
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The constructor doesn't reject relative paths, so they're already "supported"
- The issue is a bug in concatenation logic, not a missing feature

## Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation could be updated to say "paths must start with /"
- This would clarify the expected usage

Why it's NOT just a DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code accepts any string without validation
- Adding documentation without fixing the code leaves a footgun
- The behavior produces incorrect results, not just unexpected ones
- A documentation fix would be a workaround, not addressing the root issue

## Considering BUG
Why this IS a BUG:
1. URLPath is a public API that accepts any string path
2. No validation prevents relative paths in the constructor
3. No documentation requires paths to start with "/"
4. The make_absolute_url method produces objectively incorrect URLs
5. The concatenation logic has a clear flaw: missing separator
6. The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing correct usage
7. Users can reasonably expect URLPath("test") to work properly
8. The malformed URLs ('/apitest' instead of '/api/test') are clearly wrong

## Final Assessment
This is a clear BUG. The URLPath class accepts relative paths but handles them incorrectly,
producing malformed URLs. The lack of validation combined with incorrect concatenation logic
makes this a legitimate bug that should be fixed, not worked around with documentation or
dismissed as invalid usage.
