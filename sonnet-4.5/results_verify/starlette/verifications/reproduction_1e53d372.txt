## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report claims that starlette.middleware.errors.ServerErrorMiddleware.format_line generates invalid HTML entities by omitting the required semicolon from `&nbsp`, producing `&nbsp` instead of `&nbsp;`.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Hypothesis Test Execution**
   - Ran the provided hypothesis test which tests various inputs
   - Test FAILED on input: line=' ' (single space)
   - The test correctly identified that when a space is present in the line, the formatted output contains `&nbsp` without semicolon

2. **Direct Reproduction**
   - Executed the provided reproduction code with test line "    some code with spaces"
   - Output confirmed the bug:
     ```html
     <p class="center-line"><span class="frame-line center-line">
     <span class="lineno">10.</span> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsome&nbspcode&nbspwith&nbspspaces</span></p>
     ```
   - Found 7 instances of `&nbsp` without semicolon in the output

3. **Source Code Verification**
   - Located the bug in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/errors.py
   - Line 192 contains: `"line": html.escape(line).replace(" ", "&nbsp"),`
   - Confirms the bug: spaces are replaced with `&nbsp` (missing semicolon)

### Effect of the Bug
The bug produces technically invalid HTML according to W3C standards. Every space character in the error traceback lines is replaced with `&nbsp` instead of the correct `&nbsp;`. While most modern browsers are lenient and will still render this correctly, it:
- Produces invalid HTML that fails W3C validators
- May cause issues with strict HTML parsers
- Violates HTML specification requirements

### Conclusion
The bug is reproducible and confirmed. The format_line method generates HTML with invalid character entity references.
