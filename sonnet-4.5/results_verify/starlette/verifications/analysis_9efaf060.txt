BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible classification:

1. BUG (Valid bug report):
   REASONS FOR:
   - The code fails to correctly parse standard IPv6 addresses in Host headers
   - IPv6 is a fundamental internet protocol, not an obscure edge case
   - The RFCs (3986 and 2732) clearly define the bracket notation for IPv6 addresses
   - The bug causes complete failure of the middleware for IPv6 connections
   - The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality
   - Real-world impact: IPv6-only networks cannot use applications with this middleware

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly promise IPv6 support
   - Could be argued that IPv6 support is a new feature

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report):
   REASONS FOR:
   - Documentation never explicitly states IPv6 is supported
   - Examples only show domain names, not IP addresses

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The bug report is technically correct - the code fails on valid Host headers
   - IPv6 is a standard protocol, not undefined behavior
   - The middleware's purpose is to validate Host headers, which by RFC can contain IPv6

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
   REASONS FOR:
   - IPv6 adoption is still not universal
   - Workaround exists (use domain names instead of IP addresses)

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - IPv6 is an internet standard
   - The bug completely breaks functionality for IPv6 users
   - Security implications: IPv6 users can't use this security middleware

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality):
   REASONS FOR:
   - IPv6 support could be seen as an enhancement
   - Documentation doesn't mention IP addresses at all

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - This is fixing broken parsing, not adding new capability
   - The middleware already accepts IP addresses (IPv4 works)
   - Host header parsing should handle all valid formats per RFC

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue):
   REASONS FOR:
   - Could document that IPv6 is not supported

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The code is broken, not the documentation
   - Documenting a limitation doesn't fix the underlying problem
   - The expected behavior (supporting standard Host headers) is reasonable

CONCLUSION:
This is a BUG. The middleware fails to correctly parse Host headers that follow the IPv6 standard defined in RFCs 3986 and 2732. While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise IPv6 support, a middleware that validates Host headers should handle all valid Host header formats according to internet standards. The impact is significant (complete failure for IPv6 users) and the fix is straightforward without breaking existing functionality.
