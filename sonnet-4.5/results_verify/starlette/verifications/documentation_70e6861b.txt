## Documentation Analysis

### WSGI and CGI Specifications

I have reviewed the relevant specifications and documentation:

1. **PEP 3333 (WSGI Specification)**:
   - States: "SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT are required strings and must never be empty."
   - This clearly indicates that SERVER_PORT must be a string type, not an integer.

2. **RFC 3875 (CGI 1.1 Specification)**:
   - Section 4.1.15 defines SERVER_PORT with the grammar: `SERVER_PORT = server-port` and `server-port = 1*digit`
   - This means SERVER_PORT must be a string containing one or more digits.
   - The CGI spec is important because WSGI is based on CGI and inherits many of its conventions.

3. **Starlette Documentation**:
   - The Starlette documentation does not provide specific details about the build_environ function's implementation.
   - The function's docstring only states: "Builds a scope and request body into a WSGI environ object."
   - There is no documentation stating that Starlette's implementation deviates from the WSGI spec.

4. **Deprecation Notice**:
   - The code itself contains a deprecation warning stating the WSGI middleware will be removed in a future release.
   - Users are directed to use https://github.com/abersheeran/a2wsgi as a replacement.

### Conclusion

The bug report's claim is correct. Both the WSGI specification (PEP 3333) and the underlying CGI specification (RFC 3875) clearly require SERVER_PORT to be a string representation of the port number, not an integer. Starlette's implementation violates this requirement by directly assigning the integer port value without converting it to a string.

The fact that this middleware is deprecated does not invalidate the bug - as long as it's part of Starlette, it should conform to the WSGI specification it claims to implement.
