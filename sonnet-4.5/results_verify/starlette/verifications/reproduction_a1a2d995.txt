BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. REPRODUCTION OF THE EXACT BUG REPORT:
   The bug report's code example was tested and CONFIRMED to produce the exact error described:
   - Input: allow_headers=['Ä€'] (character U+0100, Latin Extended-A)
   - Error: UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode character '\u0100' in position 57
   - The error occurs exactly as described in the bug report

2. STACK TRACE ANALYSIS:
   The error occurs in this sequence:
   a) CORSMiddleware.__init__ accepts the Unicode header 'Ä€' without validation
   b) The header is added to preflight_headers dictionary as part of "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" value
   c) When preflight_response() is called, it creates a PlainTextResponse with these headers
   d) PlainTextResponse.__init__ calls self.init_headers()
   e) init_headers() attempts to encode all header values as latin-1: v.encode("latin-1")
   f) This encoding fails for the Unicode character 'Ä€' (U+0100)

3. ADDITIONAL TESTING:
   Tested with various non-latin-1 characters, ALL FAILED with the same error:
   - 'Ä€' (U+0100) - Latin Extended-A: UnicodeEncodeError
   - 'Î©' (U+03A9) - Greek: UnicodeEncodeError
   - 'â™¥' (U+2665) - Symbol: UnicodeEncodeError
   - 'ä½ ' (U+4F60) - Chinese: UnicodeEncodeError
   - 'ðŸ˜€' (U+1F600) - Emoji: UnicodeEncodeError

4. CONTROL TEST:
   Tested with normal ASCII/latin-1 compatible headers:
   - 'X-Custom-Header': Works perfectly, returns 200 OK
   - Standard headers work as expected

5. BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION:
   - The middleware DOES accept non-latin-1 characters during initialization
   - The middleware DOES NOT validate encoding compatibility
   - The crash DOES occur when trying to send the response
   - The crash happens consistently and deterministically
   - This is NOT a random or intermittent issue

6. IMPACT:
   - Any user who passes non-latin-1 characters in allow_headers will experience a crash
   - The crash occurs at response time, not at configuration time
   - This could cause production services to fail if configured with Unicode headers

TECHNICAL ACCURACY OF BUG REPORT:
The bug report is technically accurate in all aspects:
- The code reproduces the exact error
- The error message matches exactly
- The root cause analysis (latin-1 encoding requirement) is correct
- The failing input example is valid and causes the described crash
