BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

BUG (Valid Bug Report):
------------------------
STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
- The code demonstrably fails to match weak ETags with themselves (W/"123" != W/"123")
- This violates RFC 7232 Section 2.3.2 which mandates weak comparison for If-None-Match
- The bug causes incorrect HTTP caching behavior, potentially serving stale content
- The implementation error is clear: only request ETags are normalized, not response ETags
- The fix is straightforward and would align the code with HTTP standards
- This affects real-world usage where web servers commonly use weak ETags

INVALID:
---------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- The code does work correctly for strong ETags
- No documentation explicitly promises RFC compliance

WHY IT'S NOT INVALID:
- Starlette is a web framework that should follow HTTP standards by default
- ETag comparison is a fundamental HTTP caching mechanism
- The behavior contradicts reasonable expectations for any HTTP implementation

WONTFIX:
---------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- This is not an obscure edge case - weak ETags are commonly used
- The bug affects basic HTTP caching functionality
- The fix is simple and doesn't break backward compatibility

WHY IT'S NOT WONTFIX:
- This is a practical issue that affects production systems
- Weak ETags are standard in HTTP/1.1 and widely used by CDNs and web servers

FEATURE_REQUEST:
-----------------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- Not requesting new functionality - the method already attempts ETag comparison
- The code clearly intends to handle weak ETags (it strips "W/")
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

WHY IT'S NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
- The code already tries to handle weak ETags but does so incorrectly
- This is a bug fix, not a feature addition

DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
-------------------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- The code behavior is incorrect according to HTTP standards
- No documentation suggests non-standard ETag handling
- The issue is in the implementation, not the documentation

WHY IT'S NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Even if documentation existed saying "weak ETags don't match", this would still be wrong

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This is clearly a BUG. The implementation violates HTTP standards (RFC 7232), causes incorrect caching behavior, and fails to match identical weak ETags. The bug is well-documented, easily reproducible, and has a clear fix.
