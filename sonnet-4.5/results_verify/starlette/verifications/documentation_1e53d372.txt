## Documentation Analysis

### HTML Specification Requirements

1. **W3C HTML Standard**
   - According to the HTML specification (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#character-references), character references MUST be terminated by a semicolon.
   - The specification explicitly states: "Named character references must be terminated by a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;)"
   - This applies to all three forms of character references:
     - Named character references (e.g., &nbsp;)
     - Decimal numeric character references (e.g., &#160;)
     - Hexadecimal numeric character references (e.g., &#x00A0;)

2. **Valid vs Invalid HTML**
   - `&nbsp;` is VALID according to HTML standards
   - `&nbsp` is INVALID according to HTML standards
   - While browsers may be lenient and still render `&nbsp` correctly, this is error recovery behavior, not correct parsing

### Starlette Documentation

1. **ServerErrorMiddleware Documentation**
   - The Starlette documentation mentions ServerErrorMiddleware briefly
   - It states that in DEBUG mode, it displays an application traceback
   - No specific documentation about HTML format requirements or entity encoding

2. **format_line Method**
   - No specific documentation found for the format_line method
   - The method is an internal implementation detail of ServerErrorMiddleware
   - Purpose appears to be formatting source code lines for HTML display in error pages

### Assumptions Made by Bug Report

The bug report assumes:
1. HTML entities must end with semicolons - **CORRECT** (verified by HTML spec)
2. The code produces `&nbsp` without semicolon - **CORRECT** (verified in source)
3. This violates W3C standards - **CORRECT** (verified by HTML spec)
4. This is technically invalid HTML - **CORRECT**

### Conclusion

All assumptions made by the bug report are correct and well-founded. The HTML specification clearly requires semicolons for character references, and the code demonstrably produces invalid HTML by omitting them. This is not a case of unspecified behavior - the HTML standard is explicit about this requirement.
