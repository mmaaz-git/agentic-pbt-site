## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report is accurate. The `URL.replace()` method in starlette crashes with an `IndexError` when called on URLs with empty hostnames.

### Test Results

1. **Simple reproduction case**: CONFIRMED
   - Input: `URL("http://@/path").replace(port=8000)`
   - Result: `IndexError: string index out of range`
   - Location: `starlette/datastructures.py`, line 121

2. **Hypothesis property test**: CONFIRMED
   - The property test fails immediately with any valid port number (1-65535)
   - The crash is consistent and reproducible

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurs in the `URL.replace()` method at line 121 of `datastructures.py`:

```python
if hostname is None:
    netloc = self.netloc
    _, _, hostname = netloc.rpartition("@")

    if hostname[-1] != "]":  # <-- CRASH HERE when hostname is empty
        hostname = hostname.rsplit(":", 1)[0]
```

When the URL is `http://@/path`:
- `netloc` is `"@"`
- `netloc.rpartition("@")` returns `('', '@', '')`
- `hostname` becomes an empty string `""`
- Accessing `hostname[-1]` on an empty string raises `IndexError`

### Validity of the Test URL

The URL `http://@/path` is a syntactically valid URL according to RFC 3986:
- It has a scheme (`http`)
- It has an authority component with an empty host (`@` indicates userinfo separator)
- It has a path (`/path`)

While unusual, this URL structure is technically valid and should be handled gracefully by the library.

### Impact

This is a crash bug that causes the application to fail with an unhandled exception when processing URLs with empty hostnames. The bug affects any call to `URL.replace()` with parameters that trigger hostname processing (port, username, password, hostname) on such URLs.
