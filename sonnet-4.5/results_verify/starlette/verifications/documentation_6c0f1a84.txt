DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing both HTML specifications and Starlette documentation:

## HTML Specification Requirements

According to the HTML specification (WHATWG) and web standards:

1. **Formal Requirement**: Named character references MUST end with a semicolon (;). The HTML spec states: "The name must be one that is terminated by a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;)."

2. **Validity**: Using named character references without a semicolon is explicitly flagged as invalid HTML. While the spec includes some entities without semicolons in its list for browser compatibility, these are officially forbidden for HTML authors to use.

3. **Browser Behavior**: Browsers are required to support some semicolon-less entities for backwards compatibility, particularly for ISO Latin 1 characters (Unicode < 256), which includes `&nbsp`. However, this is error-recovery behavior, not valid HTML.

4. **Best Practices**: The W3C, WHATWG, and all major web standards organizations recommend always using semicolons with HTML entities. This has "always been regarded as good practice."

## Starlette Documentation

The Starlette documentation for ServerErrorMiddleware:

1. **Purpose**: Describes the middleware as handling 500 responses and providing debug tracebacks when `debug=True`

2. **HTML Generation**: Does not specify the exact format of HTML entities used in the debug output

3. **No Specification**: There is no documentation stating that Starlette intentionally uses invalid HTML entities or that this is a design choice

## Conclusion

The bug report's claim is correct: `&nbsp` without a semicolon violates the HTML specification. While browsers may render it due to error recovery, it produces technically invalid HTML. The Starlette documentation does not indicate this is intentional behavior.
