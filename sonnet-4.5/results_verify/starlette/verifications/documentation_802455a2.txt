DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## PEP 3333 WSGI Specification

According to PEP 3333 (Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0.1), which is the authoritative specification for WSGI:

1. **String Type Requirement**: The specification explicitly states that "CGI-defined variables must be native strings, if they are present at all." SERVER_PORT is a CGI-defined variable.

2. **Required Variable**: The specification states that "SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT are required strings and must never be empty." This clearly indicates SERVER_PORT must be a string type.

3. **CGI Compliance**: The WSGI specification follows the CGI (Common Gateway Interface) standard, where all environment variables are strings by definition.

## Starlette Documentation

The Starlette module includes a deprecation warning stating:
"starlette.middleware.wsgi is deprecated and will be removed in a future release."

However, the function's docstring only states:
"Builds a scope and request body into a WSGI environ object."

There is no Starlette-specific documentation that contradicts the WSGI specification or suggests SERVER_PORT should be an integer.

## Conclusion

The WSGI specification (PEP 3333) unambiguously requires SERVER_PORT to be a string. The current implementation returning an integer violates this specification. Even though the module is deprecated, as long as it exists in the codebase, it should conform to the standard it claims to implement.
