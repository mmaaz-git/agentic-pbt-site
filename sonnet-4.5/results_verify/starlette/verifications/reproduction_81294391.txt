## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully reproduced the reported bug by running the provided test cases.

### Basic Reproduction Test
The simple test with input "hello world" confirmed the bug:
- Input line: "hello world"
- Output: `<p class="center-line"><span class="frame-line center-line"><span class="lineno">10.</span> hello&nbspworld</span></p>`
- **Confirmed**: The output contains "&nbsp" without a semicolon

### Property-Based Test
The Hypothesis property-based test also failed as expected:
- The test correctly identifies that lines with spaces get "&nbsp" (without semicolon) instead of "&nbsp;" (with semicolon)
- Example failing input: A single space character " " produces "&nbsp" without semicolon

### Code Verification
Examining the source code at line 191 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/starlette_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/errors.py`:
```python
"line": html.escape(line).replace(" ", "&nbsp"),
```
This confirms the code indeed uses "&nbsp" without a semicolon.

### Browser/Parser Behavior
Testing with Python's html.parser and html.unescape shows that both "&nbsp;" (correct) and "&nbsp" (incorrect) are parsed identically:
- Both produce the same non-breaking space character (\xa0)
- Modern parsers are lenient and handle the missing semicolon

### Technical Assessment
1. The bug report is technically accurate - the code does use "&nbsp" without semicolon
2. The HTML entity is incomplete according to W3C HTML standards
3. However, most modern browsers and parsers handle this gracefully
4. The functionality still works correctly in practice despite the standards violation
