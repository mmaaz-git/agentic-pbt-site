TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluation of possible categorizations for this bug report:

## BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code generates technically invalid HTML by using `&nbsp` without semicolon
- HTML specification explicitly requires semicolons for named character references
- The fix is trivial (adding a semicolon) and makes the HTML valid
- This is a clear violation of web standards, not a matter of interpretation
- The code's intent is clearly to use non-breaking spaces, but it's doing so incorrectly

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Browsers handle this gracefully through error recovery
- No user-facing functionality is broken
- The debug pages still render correctly in practice

## WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The issue has minimal practical impact since browsers render it correctly anyway
- This only affects debug mode, not production code
- The HTML still displays correctly despite being technically invalid
- It's been working this way without complaints

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Violating HTML standards is not trivial, especially for a web framework
- The fix is extremely simple (one character addition)
- Valid HTML is important for accessibility tools and validators
- Setting a bad example in a popular framework

## INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug is real and verifiable.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code demonstrably produces invalid HTML
- The HTML specification is clear about semicolon requirements
- The bug report is accurate and well-documented

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is not a documentation issue.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Starlette doesn't document that it intentionally generates invalid HTML

## FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- HTML entities with semicolons are not a "new feature" but correct syntax
- This is a bug fix, not an enhancement

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

This should be categorized as **BUG**. The reasons are:

1. **Standards Compliance**: The code violates the HTML specification by omitting required semicolons from named character references.

2. **Correctness**: While browsers may handle the error, generating invalid HTML is objectively wrong for a web framework.

3. **Simple Fix**: The solution requires changing literally one character in the code - adding the semicolon.

4. **Professional Standards**: A professional web framework should generate valid HTML, especially in its own debug pages which developers will see.

5. **No Downside**: Adding the semicolon has zero negative impact - it makes the HTML valid while maintaining identical visual rendering.

The fact that browsers handle this error gracefully does not make it acceptable. By the same logic, we wouldn't accept a JSON library that generates `{"key": "value",}` with trailing commas just because some parsers accept it. Standards exist for a reason, and frameworks should follow them.
