## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The middleware strips whitespace when checking incoming headers (line 129) but doesn't strip when storing configured headers (line 67). This inconsistency is clearly a logic error.
2. **Violates Principle of Least Surprise**: Users would expect that if they configure `allow_headers=["X-Custom "]`, it would either:
   - Work for requests with "X-Custom" header
   - Fail immediately with a clear error about invalid header name
   Instead, it silently accepts the configuration and then mysteriously rejects valid requests.
3. **Real-World Impact**: This could cause production issues where developers accidentally include whitespace (e.g., from copy-paste or configuration files) and experience hard-to-debug CORS failures.
4. **Clear Fix Available**: The solution is straightforward - strip whitespace consistently in both places.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly inconsistent behavior that should be fixed.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- HTTP specifications state that header names cannot contain whitespace, so technically the configuration is invalid.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The middleware accepts the invalid configuration without error, creating an expectation that it will work.
- The bug is not about accepting invalid headers, but about inconsistent handling of whitespace.
- The middleware already strips whitespace in one place but not the other - this is clearly unintended.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that developers shouldn't put whitespace in header names.
- Might be considered an edge case.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - whitespace issues are common in configuration.
- The fix is trivial (add `.strip()` to one line).
- The current behavior causes silent failures that are hard to debug.
- The middleware already attempts to handle this by stripping in one place.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that supporting whitespace-tolerant configuration is a new feature.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code already partially handles whitespace (strips on checking but not on storing).
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality.
- The middleware should either consistently strip or consistently not strip - the current mixed approach is a bug.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't specify how whitespace is handled.
- Could document that header names must not contain whitespace.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not just a documentation issue - the code behavior is inconsistent.
- Even if documented, the current behavior is confusing and error-prone.
- The code should be fixed to handle this consistently, not just documented.

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The middleware has inconsistent whitespace handling:
1. It accepts headers with whitespace in configuration (line 67: no strip)
2. It strips whitespace when checking incoming headers (line 129: with strip)
3. This causes valid requests to be incorrectly rejected

The fix is simple and correct: strip whitespace consistently in both places. This aligns with HTTP specifications and prevents confusing failures.
