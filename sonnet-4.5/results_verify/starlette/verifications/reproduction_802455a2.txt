REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the bug report.

## Test Execution

1. Created and ran the hypothesis test provided in the bug report
2. Created and ran the specific reproduction case

## Results

When running the test with a scope containing `"server": ("example.com", 8080)`:

- The `build_environ` function returns `environ["SERVER_PORT"] = 8080` (an integer)
- The type is confirmed as `<class 'int'>`
- This occurs for all port numbers tested (1-65535)

## Verification of Bug

The bug is confirmed. Looking at line 50 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/starlette_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/wsgi.py`:

```python
environ["SERVER_PORT"] = server[1]
```

This directly assigns the port number from the server tuple, which is an integer, to the environ dictionary without converting it to a string.

## Impact

The function `build_environ` is responsible for converting ASGI scope to WSGI environ format. It currently returns SERVER_PORT as an integer instead of a string. This is a clear deviation from the expected behavior according to WSGI specifications.
