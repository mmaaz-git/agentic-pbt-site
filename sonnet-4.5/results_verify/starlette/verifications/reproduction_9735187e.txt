# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The FloatConvertor's `to_string()` method indeed fails to correctly round-trip very small float values.

## Test Results

### 1. Property-Based Test
The property-based test using Hypothesis passed for most randomly generated cases (100 examples), but this is because Hypothesis likely didn't generate extremely small values like 1e-21 in its default strategy.

### 2. Specific Test Case
The specific test case from the bug report **FAILED** as described:
- Input: `"0.000000000000000000001"`
- Float value after convert(): `1e-21`
- String value after to_string(): `"0"`
- Expected: `"0.000000000000000000001"` or at least a string that converts back to `1e-21`
- Actual: `"0"` (which converts to `0.0`, not `1e-21`)

### 3. Edge Cases Analysis
Testing multiple decimal values revealed:
- Values from 0.1 down to 0.00000000000000000001 (1e-20) work correctly
- Values at 1e-21 and smaller (0.000000000000000000001, 0.0000000000000000000001) fail
- The failure point is exactly at values smaller than 1e-20

## Root Cause Verification
The bug occurs because:
1. The regex pattern `[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?` accepts strings with unlimited decimal places
2. The `convert()` method correctly parses these to float values
3. The `to_string()` method uses `"%0.20f"` formatting, which only preserves 20 decimal places
4. For values like 1e-21, the formatting produces "0.00000000000000000000"
5. After stripping trailing zeros and dots, this becomes "0"
6. The value "0" converts to 0.0, not the original 1e-21

## Impact
This bug breaks URL generation in Starlette routing. When a route contains a float parameter with a very small value (< 1e-20), the generated URL will contain "0" instead of the actual value, causing data loss and incorrect routing behavior.
