## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior is not explicitly documented, and one could argue that the middleware is working as designed. The code intentionally drops ports 80 and 443, which are the two most common ports for HTTP/HTTPS. Someone might have intended this behavior to simplify URLs by always dropping these common ports. Additionally, running HTTP on port 443 is highly unusual and could be considered a misconfiguration rather than a valid use case that needs support.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies a logical inconsistency in the code. Port 443 is NOT the default port for HTTP, and port 80 is NOT the default port for HTTPS. The RFC standards are clear about default ports for each protocol. The current implementation violates the principle that non-default ports should be preserved in URLs. The test cases prove the middleware produces incorrect URLs in valid scenarios.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Running HTTP on port 443 or WS on port 443 is extremely unusual and likely represents a misconfiguration. The real-world impact is minimal since almost no production systems would run HTTP on port 443. The bug is marked as "Low" severity even by the reporter. Fixing this could potentially break existing systems that rely on the current behavior, even if that behavior is technically incorrect.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial and makes the code more logically correct. The proposed solution is clean and follows proper HTTP standards. Even if the use case is rare, correctness matters in a web framework. WebSocket on port 443 is more plausible than HTTP on 443, especially in development or testing scenarios. The bug represents a conceptual error in understanding port defaults that should be corrected.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There is absolutely no documentation about how the middleware handles ports. The current behavior, while technically incorrect by RFC standards, might be intentional. If the maintainers intended to always drop ports 80 and 443 for simplicity, then the documentation should explicitly state this behavior. The lack of documentation is the real problem here, not necessarily the code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code behavior is objectively wrong according to HTTP/HTTPS standards. Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it correct. The RFC standards clearly define default ports for each protocol, and the middleware should follow these standards. This is a logic bug in the code, not a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current code might not have been designed to handle non-standard port configurations. Supporting HTTP on port 443 could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The middleware works correctly for 99% of use cases (standard port configurations). Adding support for edge cases could be considered an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not asking for new functionality but rather fixing existing incorrect behavior. The middleware already attempts to handle ports; it just does so incorrectly. The issue is with the logic of the existing feature, not a request for something new. Port handling is a core part of URL manipulation and should work correctly by default.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code contains a clear logical error: it drops ports based on a fixed set {80, 443} rather than considering whether each port is the default for its scheme. This violates HTTP/HTTPS standards where port defaults are scheme-specific. The bug is reproducible, the test cases are valid, and the fix is straightforward. The middleware produces objectively incorrect URLs when redirecting HTTP on port 443 to HTTPS.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The behavior might be intentional, even if not standards-compliant. Without documentation, we can't know if the developers intended this behavior. The edge case is so rare that it might not qualify as a bug worth fixing. The current behavior works correctly for all normal use cases.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate bug, though a low-severity one. The current implementation contains a logical error where it treats ports 80 and 443 as universally "default" rather than understanding that default ports are scheme-specific. According to RFC standards, port 80 is default for HTTP/WS, and port 443 is default for HTTPS/WSS. The middleware should only drop a port if it matches the default for the current scheme, not based on a fixed set.

The bug report provides accurate test cases that demonstrate the issue. The reproduction is successful and shows that the middleware produces incorrect redirect URLs in specific but valid scenarios. While running HTTP on port 443 is unusual, it's not invalid, and a web framework should handle it correctly. The WebSocket case (ws on port 443) is more plausible and strengthens the argument for fixing this.

The complete lack of documentation for this middleware makes it difficult to determine intent, but following established HTTP standards is the most reasonable approach. The proposed fix is clean, correct, and unlikely to break existing applications since it only affects edge cases that are currently handled incorrectly. This is a valid bug that should be fixed to ensure the middleware behaves correctly according to HTTP/HTTPS standards.
