BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
======================

Bug Target: starlette.middleware.errors.ServerErrorMiddleware.format_line
Reported Issue: Incomplete HTML entities (&nbsp instead of &nbsp;)

REPRODUCTION RESULTS
--------------------

1. Code Location Verification:
   - File: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/starlette_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/errors.py
   - Line 191: html.escape(line).replace(" ", "&nbsp")
   - Confirmed: The code does replace spaces with "&nbsp" (missing semicolon)

2. Bug Reproduction Test:
   - Ran the provided test code successfully
   - Input: "    def example_function():"
   - Actual output: "&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdef&nbspexample_function():"
   - Expected output: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def&nbsp;example_function():"
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED - Missing semicolon in all &nbsp entities

3. Property-Based Test (Hypothesis):
   - The provided Hypothesis test runs correctly
   - It fails on ANY input containing spaces
   - Example failure: Input " " produces "&nbsp" instead of "&nbsp;"
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED through property testing

4. Direct Method Test:
   - Called ServerErrorMiddleware.format_line() directly
   - The method produces HTML output with incomplete &nbsp entities
   - The bug affects the actual HTML generation in debug mode
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED in production code path

5. HTML Parser Behavior:
   - Python's HTML parser accepts both "&nbsp" and "&nbsp;" due to error recovery
   - However, "&nbsp" without semicolon is technically invalid HTML5
   - Browsers render both due to backwards compatibility, but it's still a standards violation

EFFECT OF THE BUG
-----------------

The bug produces technically invalid HTML according to HTML5 specifications. While most modern browsers will render the output correctly due to error recovery mechanisms, this can cause:

1. HTML validation failures when the debug output is validated
2. Potential issues with strict HTML parsers
3. Problems with accessibility tools that expect valid HTML
4. Possible rendering issues in future browser versions with stricter parsing

The bug is real and reproducible. The code generates HTML with incomplete character entity references, violating HTML5 standards that require named character references to end with a semicolon.
