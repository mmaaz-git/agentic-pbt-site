## Documentation Analysis for starlette.middleware.errors.ServerErrorMiddleware.format_line

### Starlette Documentation
The official Starlette documentation (https://www.starlette.io/exceptions/) does not provide specific implementation details about the ServerErrorMiddleware.format_line method or its HTML formatting requirements. The documentation only mentions that ServerErrorMiddleware "Returns 500 responses when server errors occur" as part of the middleware stack, with no specification about HTML entity formatting.

### HTML Standards Documentation
According to W3C HTML specifications (https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/entities.html), HTML character entities should properly include a trailing semicolon. The correct format for a non-breaking space entity is "&nbsp;" (with semicolon), not "&nbsp" (without semicolon).

The HTML specification defines entities with the pattern: ampersand + entity name + semicolon. For example:
- "&nbsp;" for non-breaking space
- "&lt;" for less-than
- "&gt;" for greater-than

### Function Purpose and Behavior
The format_line method in ServerErrorMiddleware is an internal implementation detail that formats error traceback lines for HTML display in debug mode. The method:
1. HTML-escapes the line content to prevent XSS issues
2. Replaces spaces with non-breaking space entities for proper formatting
3. Returns formatted HTML snippet for display in error pages

### Key Finding
There is no documentation specifying that the method MUST use incomplete HTML entities or that it should follow strict HTML standards. The method is internal to the middleware and its output format is not part of the public API contract. The documentation does not specify how HTML entities should be formatted in internal error display pages.
