## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug could be considered invalid if we argue that developers should never include whitespace in header names in the first place, as HTTP header field names are tokens that don't contain whitespace. The developer is essentially providing invalid input (a header name with whitespace), and the library's behavior with invalid input is undefined. The documentation doesn't promise to handle malformed header names gracefully.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The library does accept the configuration without any error or warning, suggesting it considers headers with whitespace as valid input. More importantly, there is a clear inconsistency in the code where one part preserves whitespace and another part strips it, leading to incorrect behavior. This asymmetry is objectively present in the code and causes legitimate requests to be rejected.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered a trivial edge case that only occurs when developers make configuration mistakes (adding accidental whitespace). The workaround is simple - don't include whitespace in header names. The impact is limited to development/configuration time issues rather than production runtime failures with valid data. Most developers would quickly notice and fix the whitespace in their configuration.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency in the code is clear and the fix is trivial (adding .strip() to one line). The bug causes valid client requests to be rejected, which could be difficult to debug. The error message doesn't indicate the whitespace issue, making it frustrating for developers. The cost of fixing is minimal while the benefit is preventing confusion and improving robustness.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify how whitespace in header configuration is handled. If the current behavior (storing headers with whitespace but stripping during validation) is intentional, then the documentation should warn users not to include whitespace in header names. The documentation could be updated to explicitly state that header names should not contain leading or trailing whitespace.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The issue isn't just about unclear documentation - there's an actual inconsistency in the code logic. One part of the code preserves whitespace while another strips it, which is objectively inconsistent regardless of what the documentation says. Fixing the documentation to warn about whitespace doesn't address the underlying code inconsistency.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that properly handling whitespace in configuration is a new feature - the library currently doesn't normalize header names during configuration, and adding this normalization would be an enhancement. The request is essentially asking for more robust input validation and normalization, which could be seen as a feature addition rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but rather fixing an inconsistency in existing functionality. The validation logic already strips whitespace, suggesting that stripping is the intended behavior. The initialization code just forgot to do the same stripping. This is fixing broken behavior rather than adding new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There is a clear, objective inconsistency in the code where line 67 lowercases headers without stripping whitespace, while line 129 strips whitespace before checking membership. This asymmetry causes valid requests to be incorrectly rejected when configuration contains whitespace. The fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent. The validation logic's stripping behavior suggests that headers should be normalized, but the initialization forgot to do this normalization.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The library is working as coded, and the issue only arises from invalid input (headers with whitespace). HTTP header names shouldn't contain whitespace, so this is user error rather than library error. The library isn't required to handle every form of invalid input gracefully, and developers should be responsible for providing clean configuration values.

**Overall consideration**
The core issue here is an objective inconsistency in the code: the initialization preserves whitespace while the validation strips it. This asymmetry is clearly present in the code at lines 67 and 129. While one could argue that header names with whitespace are invalid input, the library accepts this input without error and then behaves inconsistently with it. The validation logic's stripping behavior (line 129) suggests the intended design is to be lenient with whitespace, but the initialization code (line 67) fails to implement this same leniency.

The fact that the validation logic already strips whitespace indicates this is not about accepting invalid input but rather about normalizing input consistently. If the library intended to reject headers with whitespace, it should do so at configuration time with a clear error. Instead, it accepts the configuration and then fails later with a confusing error that doesn't mention the whitespace issue.

Given that the fix is trivial (adding .strip() to line 67) and would make the behavior consistent with what the validation logic already does, this appears to be a legitimate bug rather than a documentation issue or feature request. The bug causes real problems (valid requests being rejected) and the proposed fix aligns with the apparent intent of the validation code. While the bug may be triggered by imperfect user input, the inconsistent handling within the library itself is the actual bug.
