## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in starlette.middleware.wsgi.build_environ.

### What I Did:
1. Ran the property-based test from the bug report using Hypothesis
2. Tested the specific example provided in the bug report
3. Tested with various port numbers (80, 443, 8080, 1, 65535)

### Results:
The bug is confirmed to exist. The SERVER_PORT value in the WSGI environ dictionary is being set as an integer instead of a string.

**Property-based test**: Failed as expected with the error "SERVER_PORT should be str, got <class 'int'>"

**Specific example output**:
- SERVER_PORT value: 8000
- SERVER_PORT type: <class 'int'>
- Is SERVER_PORT a string? False

**All tested port values** (80, 443, 8080, 1, 65535) resulted in integer types being stored in SERVER_PORT.

### Code Location:
The bug is on line 49 of /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/wsgi.py:
```python
environ["SERVER_PORT"] = server[1]
```

The port value from the server tuple is directly assigned without converting it to a string.

### Impact:
This bug means that any WSGI application expecting SERVER_PORT to be a string (as per the WSGI specification) will receive an integer instead, potentially causing type errors or unexpected behavior in downstream WSGI applications.
