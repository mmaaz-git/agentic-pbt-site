## Documentation Analysis Report

### Starlette Documentation Review

1. **Official Starlette Middleware Documentation** (https://www.starlette.io/middleware/):
   - No specific documentation about the `__repr__` method implementation
   - No specification for how Middleware objects should be displayed
   - No explicit requirements for what constitutes a valid middleware factory
   - Documentation shows middleware can be instantiated with classes and arguments but doesn't specify representation requirements

2. **Source Code Examination**:
   - The `Middleware` class is a simple container that stores a middleware factory and its arguments
   - The factory is typed as `_MiddlewareFactory[P]` protocol, requiring only that it be callable with an `app` parameter
   - No documentation comments specify the expected behavior of `__repr__`

### Python __repr__ Conventions

From Python's official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__):

1. **Primary Convention**: Should return "a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value"

2. **Fallback Convention**: If recreation isn't possible, return a string of the form `<...some useful description...>`

3. **Purpose**: Used for debugging, should be "information-rich and unambiguous"

### Analysis of Current Implementation

The current `__repr__` implementation attempts to follow Python's primary convention by producing output like:
```python
Middleware(function_name, arg1, arg2, key=value)
```

However, when the middleware factory lacks a `__name__` attribute, it produces:
```python
Middleware(, arg1, arg2, key=value)
```

This violates Python's repr conventions because:
1. It's not valid Python syntax (leading comma is a syntax error)
2. It cannot be used to recreate the object
3. It's ambiguous and not information-rich (the empty first element provides no information)

### Documentation Gaps

1. Starlette doesn't document the expected behavior of `Middleware.__repr__`
2. There's no specification for how callable instances should be represented
3. No documentation states that middleware factories must have a `__name__` attribute

### Conclusion

The lack of specific documentation about `__repr__` behavior means we must fall back on Python's general conventions. The current implementation produces syntactically invalid Python code when handling callable instances without `__name__`, which clearly violates Python's documented repr conventions. This is not a case of unspecified behavior - it's a violation of Python's standard conventions that all __repr__ methods should follow.
