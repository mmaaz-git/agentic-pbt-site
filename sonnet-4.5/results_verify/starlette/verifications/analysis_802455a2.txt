BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

## Considerations for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- PEP 3333 explicitly requires SERVER_PORT to be a string, not an integer
- The specification is unambiguous: "SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT are required strings"
- This is a clear contract violation of a well-established standard (WSGI)
- The fix is trivial and correct: `environ["SERVER_PORT"] = str(server[1])`
- WSGI-compliant applications may fail or behave incorrectly with integer SERVER_PORT
- Other WSGI implementations correctly return SERVER_PORT as a string

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The module is deprecated with a warning
- Many applications might handle integers gracefully
- The bug has likely existed for a while without major complaints

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The module is deprecated and will be removed
- Users are directed to use a replacement (a2wsgi)
- Fixing deprecated code might not be worth the effort
- Applications that work with this have already adapted

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Even deprecated code should be correct while it exists
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- Standards compliance matters for interoperability
- Users still using this module deserve correct behavior

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug clearly exists and violates the specification

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The specification is clear and unambiguous
- The test case correctly identifies the issue
- The reproduction is accurate

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - this is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The WSGI specification already defines the correct behavior
- This is a bug fix, not a feature addition

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code could be left as-is with documentation warning about non-compliance

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is wrong according to the specification it implements
- Documentation cannot override a standard specification
- The issue is in the code, not the documentation

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code violates the WSGI specification (PEP 3333) by returning SERVER_PORT as an integer instead of a string. The specification is explicit and unambiguous about this requirement. While the module is deprecated, it still exists in the codebase and should conform to the standard it claims to implement. The fix is trivial and correct.
