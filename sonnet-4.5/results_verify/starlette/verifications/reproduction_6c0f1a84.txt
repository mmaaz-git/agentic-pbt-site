REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. **Bug Reproduction**: The bug report's test cases run correctly and demonstrate the issue:
   - The simple test shows that `html.escape(line).replace(" ", "&nbsp")` produces `&nbsp` without semicolons
   - The property-based test with Hypothesis confirms this happens for any text containing spaces
   - Output matched exactly what the bug report claimed:
     * Result: `&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdef&nbspexample():`
     * Expected: `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def&nbsp;example():`

2. **Source Code Verification**: I examined the actual Starlette source code at:
   `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/starlette_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/errors.py`

   Line 191 contains the exact problematic code:
   ```python
   "line": html.escape(line).replace(" ", "&nbsp"),
   ```

   This confirms that Starlette's ServerErrorMiddleware does indeed use `&nbsp` without the semicolon when formatting code lines in debug mode HTML output.

3. **Impact**: This affects the HTML generated for debug error pages when ServerErrorMiddleware runs in debug mode. Every space in the code context shown in the traceback is replaced with the invalid HTML entity `&nbsp` (missing semicolon).

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
