BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
====================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - The code clearly intends to merge overlapping ranges (comment "# Merge ranges")
   - RFC 7233 explicitly allows and encourages coalescing overlapping ranges
   - The algorithm produces overlapping ranges in the output, violating the invariant
   - The bug is reproducible and affects real use cases
   - The fix is straightforward and aligns with both spec and intent

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - None. This is clearly a bug.

2. INVALID (Incorrect report, code works as intended):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. The code does not work as intended.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The code has a comment "# Merge ranges" showing intent to merge
   - The algorithm tries to merge but fails in specific cases
   - The output violates the non-overlapping invariant

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could argue it's an edge case that rarely occurs

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - This affects HTTP Range request handling, a standard feature
   - Can cause incorrect data to be served to clients
   - Violates RFC 7233 recommendations
   - The bug can lead to inefficient multipart responses

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. Merging is already attempted, just buggy.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The code already has merge logic, it just doesn't work correctly
   - This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new features

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. There's no documentation claiming different behavior.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The code behavior doesn't match its own implementation intent
   - The issue is in the code logic, not documentation

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

The bug occurs because the merge algorithm has a fundamental flaw:
1. When processing a new range, it checks against existing ranges in order
2. If it finds an overlap, it merges and immediately breaks
3. It doesn't check if the newly merged range now overlaps with subsequent ranges

This violates:
- The HTTP specification (RFC 7233) which expects proper coalescing
- The code's own intent (evident from the "# Merge ranges" comment)
- The invariant that output ranges should be non-overlapping and sorted
- Efficiency goals (serving overlapping ranges is inefficient)

The bug is NOT:
- A misunderstanding of expected behavior (merging IS intended)
- An enhancement request (the feature exists but is broken)
- A documentation issue (the code is wrong, not the docs)
- Trivial (it affects a core HTTP feature)

CONCLUSION: This is a clear BUG that should be fixed. The merge algorithm needs to be corrected to properly handle cases where merging creates new overlaps with subsequent ranges.
