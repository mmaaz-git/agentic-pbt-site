BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible classification:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The code crashes with IndexError on empty inputs instead of handling them gracefully
   - The error message (IndexError: string index out of range) doesn't indicate the actual problem
   - The underlying translation.get_language_info() function has proper error handling with KeyError
   - The fix is simple and makes the error handling consistent
   - The code comment says it handles both strings and sequences, implying robust handling

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Empty language codes are clearly invalid input
   - One could argue the function shouldn't be called with empty values

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Empty strings/lists are obviously invalid language codes
   - The function isn't documented to handle empty inputs gracefully

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug is real - the code does crash with IndexError
   - Other Django functions handle invalid input more gracefully
   - The proposed fix improves error messages

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Empty language codes would never occur in normal usage
   - This is an edge case that shouldn't happen in practice
   - The current error still stops execution as intended

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Poor error messages make debugging harder
   - The fix is trivial to implement
   - Defensive programming is a best practice
   - Property-based testing legitimately found this issue

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Handling empty inputs gracefully could be seen as a new feature

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature
   - The function already tries to handle various input types
   - The fix doesn't add new functionality, just fixes error handling

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation could be clearer about valid inputs
   - Could document that empty inputs raise IndexError

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The IndexError is clearly unintended
   - The code attempts to access [0] without bounds checking
   - This is a code bug, not just a documentation issue

CONCLUSION:
----------
This is a valid BUG. While empty language codes are invalid input, the function should fail gracefully with an appropriate error message (KeyError: "Unknown language code") rather than crashing with an IndexError that doesn't indicate the actual problem. The proposed fix is correct and improves error handling consistency with the rest of the Django i18n module.
