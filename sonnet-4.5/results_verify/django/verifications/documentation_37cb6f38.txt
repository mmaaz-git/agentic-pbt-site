## Django Q Object Documentation Analysis

### Official Django Documentation Review

I reviewed the official Django documentation for Q objects at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects. The documentation states:

1. **Purpose**: Q objects are designed to "encapsulate a collection of keyword arguments" for creating complex database queries.

2. **Operator Support**: The documentation explicitly mentions support for `&` (AND), `|` (OR), and `^` (XOR) operators, and states that "combining Q objects yields a new Q object."

3. **No Idempotence Guarantees**: The documentation makes NO mention of:
   - Idempotence properties
   - How Q objects should handle duplicate conditions
   - Any optimization for redundant conditions
   - Specific guarantees about Q object equality

4. **No Performance Guarantees**: There are no explicit statements about performance optimization or avoiding redundant SQL conditions.

### Source Code Documentation Review

I examined the Django source code:

1. **Q Class Docstring** (`django/db/models/query_utils.py`):
   - States: "Encapsulate filters as objects that can then be combined logically (using `&` and `|`)."
   - No mention of idempotence or optimization

2. **`_combine` Method Implementation**:
   - The method simply creates a new node and adds both operands as children
   - No check for self-combination or duplicate detection
   - No optimization for redundant conditions

3. **Node Class Equality** (`django/utils/tree.py`):
   - The `__eq__` method compares children lists directly
   - `[('x', 0)]` is not equal to `[('x', 0), ('x', 0)]`
   - This explains why `q != (q & q)`

### Key Finding: No Documented Expectation of Idempotence

The documentation and source code make no promises about:
- Idempotent behavior for Q object operations
- Optimization of redundant conditions
- Semantic equality vs structural equality

The Q objects are documented as a way to build complex queries, but there's no specification that they should follow mathematical properties of boolean algebra like idempotence.

### Comparison with Boolean Algebra

While the bug report correctly states that boolean algebra has idempotence properties (x ∧ x = x and x ∨ x = x), Django's Q objects are never documented as implementing pure boolean algebra. They are documented as query builders that combine conditions, not as mathematical boolean algebra operators.

### Conclusion on Documentation

The behavior observed is not contradicting any documented guarantees. The documentation describes Q objects as tools for combining filters, not as implementations of boolean algebra with all its mathematical properties. The current behavior follows what is documented: combining Q objects yields a new Q object that contains both operands.
