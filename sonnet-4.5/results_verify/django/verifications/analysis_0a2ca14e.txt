Bug Report Analysis and Triage
================================

## Bug Report Summary
The check_referrer_policy function incorrectly rejects SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY configurations containing trailing or leading commas, which create empty strings after splitting.

## Categorization Analysis

### Could this be BUG?
**YES - Strong evidence:**
- The validation function is demonstrably stricter than the middleware that uses the setting
- The code comment explicitly says it supports comma-separated strings for fallback
- The SecurityMiddleware would handle trailing commas fine (empty strings would be ignored)
- The validation prevents valid use cases that would work at runtime
- Users reasonably expect trailing commas to be handled gracefully, as they are in:
  * Python lists/tuples
  * Most HTTP header parsers
  * Other Django comma-separated settings

### Could this be INVALID?
**Unlikely:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The behavior contradicts the stated intent in code comments
- The inconsistency between validation and runtime is clear
- While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise trailing comma support, the general expectation from HTTP standards is that empty values between delimiters should be ignored

### Could this be WONTFIX?
**Possible but unlikely:**
- One could argue trailing commas are "sloppy" configuration
- However, this isn't an obscure edge case - trailing commas are common in:
  * Programmatic string construction
  * Manual configuration editing
  * Copy-paste operations
- The fix is trivial and has no negative side effects
- It improves user experience and API robustness

### Could this be FEATURE_REQUEST?
**No:**
- This isn't asking for new functionality
- The setting already claims to support comma-separated values
- This is fixing existing functionality to be less fragile
- The middleware already handles this case correctly; only validation is broken

### Could this be DOCUMENTATION_FIX?
**Possible but not ideal:**
- One could document that trailing commas aren't allowed
- However, this would be documenting an unnecessary limitation
- The code fix is simpler and better than documenting the quirk
- The validation should match what the middleware accepts

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
Line 266 in check_referrer_policy:
```python
values = {v.strip() for v in settings.SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY.split(",")}
```

Creates a set including empty strings when there are trailing/leading/consecutive commas.

### Proposed Fix
```python
values = {v.strip() for v in settings.SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY.split(",") if v.strip()}
```

Filters out empty strings after stripping, making the validation consistent with how the SecurityMiddleware handles the setting.

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Medium - Causes unnecessary validation failures
- **Scope**: Affects all Django applications using SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY
- **Fix Risk**: Very low - Only makes validation less strict, doesn't break existing valid configs
- **User Impact**: Improves developer experience by accepting reasonable configurations

## Recommendation

This should be categorized as **BUG** because:

1. The validation contradicts the implementation's actual behavior
2. The code comment indicates support for flexible comma-separated values
3. The current behavior violates reasonable user expectations
4. The fix is trivial and safe
5. This makes Django's API unnecessarily fragile

The bug report is well-written with:
- Clear reproduction steps
- Root cause analysis
- Proposed fix with diff
- Reasonable justification

This is a valid bug that should be fixed to improve Django's robustness and user experience.
