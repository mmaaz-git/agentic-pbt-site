## Documentation Analysis

### Django Documentation

1. **Official Django Documentation**:
   - Django's documentation mentions that `runserver` strips all headers with underscores to prevent header-spoofing
   - The documentation states: "Note that runserver strips all headers with underscores in the name, so you won't see them in META. This prevents header-spoofing based on ambiguity between underscores and dashes both being normalizing to underscores in WSGI environment variables."
   - This confirms the intended behavior: ALL headers with underscores should be removed

2. **Source Code Comments**:
   - The code itself contains a clear comment explaining the security purpose:
   ```python
   # Strip all headers with underscores in the name before constructing
   # the WSGI environ. This prevents header-spoofing based on ambiguity
   # between underscores and dashes both normalized to underscores in WSGI
   # env vars. Nginx and Apache 2.4+ both do this as well.
   ```

### Python Documentation

1. **Dictionary Iteration Rules**:
   - Python documentation and community consensus clearly state that modifying a dictionary while iterating over it causes `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`
   - This has been enforced more strictly since Python 3.8
   - The standard solution is to iterate over a copy or a list of keys

### Security Context (CVE-2015-0219)

1. **WSGI Header Spoofing Vulnerability**:
   - Headers with underscores can be used for header spoofing attacks
   - Both "Foo-Bar" and "Foo_Bar" headers normalize to "HTTP_FOO_BAR" in WSGI environ
   - Attackers can exploit this to bypass authentication or inject malicious headers
   - Django, Nginx, and Apache 2.4+ all implement underscore header stripping as a security measure

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly establishes that:
1. ALL headers with underscores MUST be removed (security requirement)
2. Python prohibits dictionary modification during iteration (language requirement)
3. The current implementation violates both requirements
4. The bug can result in incomplete header removal, creating the exact security vulnerability the code is designed to prevent
