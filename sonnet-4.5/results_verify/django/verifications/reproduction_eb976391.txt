## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in `django.db.utils.ConnectionHandler.configure_settings`.

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is confirmed to exist exactly as described in the report. The `configure_settings` method crashes with an `AttributeError` when the `TEST` setting is provided as a non-dict value.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The provided Hypothesis test correctly identifies the bug
   - Falsifying example: `databases={'default': {'TEST': ''}}`
   - Error: `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'setdefault'`

2. **Minimal Reproduction**:
   - The minimal example with `databases = {'default': {'TEST': ''}}` reproduces the bug
   - Same error occurs at line 181 in django/db/utils.py

3. **Extended Testing**:
   - Tested various non-dict values for TEST setting
   - ALL non-dict values cause the same AttributeError:
     - Empty string: FAILED
     - Integer (42): FAILED
     - Boolean (True/False): FAILED
     - List ([]): FAILED
     - None: FAILED
     - Float (3.14): FAILED

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurs in `/django/db/utils.py` at lines 172 and 181:

```python
test_settings = conn.setdefault("TEST", {})  # Line 172
# ...
for key, value in default_test_settings:
    test_settings.setdefault(key, value)  # Line 181 - crashes here
```

The code uses `setdefault()` on line 172, which:
- Returns the existing value if "TEST" key exists
- Sets and returns {} if "TEST" key doesn't exist

However, if "TEST" exists with a non-dict value (e.g., empty string), `test_settings` becomes that non-dict value. When the code tries to call `setdefault()` on `test_settings` at line 181, it fails because non-dict objects don't have a `setdefault` method.

### Impact
- Any Django application that accidentally passes a non-dict value for the TEST database setting will crash with an unhelpful AttributeError
- The error message doesn't clearly indicate that the TEST setting must be a dictionary
- This is a valid crash scenario that can occur through misconfiguration
