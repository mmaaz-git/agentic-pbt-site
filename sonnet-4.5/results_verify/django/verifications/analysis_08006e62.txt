## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Considerations for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The behavior is confirmed and reproducible - registering the same check twice with different tags overwrites the first tags
- This violates the principle of least surprise - users might reasonably expect tags to accumulate
- The check becomes inaccessible via its original tags, which could break existing code
- The implementation uses a set to store checks (preventing duplicates) but overwrites tags, creating an inconsistency
- There's no documentation warning against this pattern

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation examples show the correct way to register with multiple tags (all in one call)
- The current behavior is consistent - the second registration completely replaces the first
- There's a clear workaround: register with all tags in a single call

#### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The system works as designed - each registration sets the tags attribute
- The examples in documentation show the correct usage pattern
- The behavior is deterministic and predictable once understood

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The behavior causes the check to be inaccessible via previously registered tags
- There's no documentation stating this is the intended behavior

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments For:**
- There's an easy workaround (register with all tags at once)
- This is likely a rare edge case in practice
- Fixing it might introduce complexity or break backward compatibility

**Arguments Against:**
- This could silently break code that relies on the first tag
- The fix is relatively simple (accumulate tags instead of overwriting)
- It's a violation of expected behavior patterns

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly say multiple registrations should accumulate tags
- This could be viewed as requesting new functionality (tag accumulation)
- The current implementation clearly wasn't designed for this use case

**Arguments Against:**
- The user isn't asking for new functionality, just for existing functionality to work correctly
- Checks already support multiple tags, the issue is how they're assigned
- This is more about fixing unexpected behavior than adding features

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation doesn't warn against registering the same check multiple times
- Adding a warning would prevent user confusion
- The documentation could be clearer about the correct way to assign multiple tags

**Arguments Against:**
- The code behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation
- Simply documenting the current behavior doesn't fix the underlying issue
- Users would still lose access to checks via original tags

### Analysis Summary

The key issue is that when a check is registered multiple times:
1. The check object remains in the set (no duplicate)
2. But its tags attribute is overwritten, not accumulated
3. This makes the check inaccessible via the original tags

This creates an inconsistency: the set prevents duplicate checks, but the tags are overwritten as if it were a new registration. This half-measure behavior is confusing and can lead to silent failures where checks become inaccessible.

The proposed fix (accumulating tags) is reasonable and would make the behavior more intuitive while maintaining backward compatibility for the common case of single registration.
