## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None applicable. The documentation is explicit that an integer must be returned.

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The BaseEmailBackend docstring clearly states the method must "return the number of email messages sent"
- The SMTP backend follows this contract by returning 0 for empty lists
- The behavior is well-specified and unambiguous

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- One could argue that code checking for empty lists before calling send_messages() would never encounter this issue
- The None vs 0 distinction might seem trivial in some contexts

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty lists are common in programming
- The inconsistency between backends breaks the pluggable backend design
- Code that performs arithmetic on the return value (e.g., `total += backend.send_messages(msgs)`) will fail with TypeError
- This affects multiple backends (console and filebased)

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- If the console backend was intentionally designed to return None for empty lists

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The base class documentation is clear and correct
- The SMTP backend implements the documented behavior correctly
- Changing the documentation to allow None would break backward compatibility for code expecting integers

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- None applicable. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality.

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The feature (returning message count) already exists and is documented
- This is a bug fix to make the implementation match the specification

### Considering BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The BaseEmailBackend.send_messages() docstring explicitly states it must "return the number of email messages sent". Returning None violates this contract.

2. **Inconsistent Backend Behavior**: The SMTP backend correctly returns 0 for empty lists, while console returns None. This breaks the principle of interchangeable backends.

3. **Potential Runtime Errors**: Code expecting an integer (e.g., `total += backend.send_messages([])`) will raise TypeError when None is returned.

4. **Inheritance Issue**: The filebased backend inherits this bug, spreading the problem to multiple backends.

5. **Easy to Fix**: The fix is trivial (change `return` to `return 0`) and matches the existing pattern in SMTP backend.

6. **Not Edge Case**: Empty lists are common in real-world code, especially in batch processing or conditional sending scenarios.

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation violates the documented API contract, causes inconsistent behavior across backends, and can lead to runtime errors in user code. The bug report is accurate, well-documented, and provides a correct fix.
