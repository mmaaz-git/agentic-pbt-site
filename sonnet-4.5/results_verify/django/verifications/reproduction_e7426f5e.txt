# Bug Reproduction Analysis

## Summary
The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The `RenameModel` and `RenameIndex` operations violate their immutability contract when exceptions occur during `database_backwards()`.

## Reproduction Results

### Hypothesis Test
The provided hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue. Running the test fails with:
```
AssertionError
Falsifying example: test_rename_model_immutability_after_exception(
    old_name='A',
    new_name='O',
)
```

### Manual Reproduction
The manual reproduction script produces the exact output claimed in the bug report:
```
Before: old_name='Article', new_name='Post'
        old_name_lower='article', new_name_lower='post'
After:  old_name='Post', new_name='Article'
        old_name_lower='post', new_name_lower='article'
```

## Code Verification
Examined the actual Django source code at:
- `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`

Lines 538-551 confirm the issue in `RenameModel.database_backwards()`:
1. The method swaps old_name/new_name and their lowercase versions (lines 539-543)
2. It calls `database_forwards()` (line 545)
3. It attempts to swap them back (lines 547-551)

If `database_forwards()` raises an exception at line 545, the restoration code at lines 547-551 never executes, leaving the object in a mutated state.

Lines 1140-1157 show identical issue in `RenameIndex.database_backwards()`.

## Effect
When `database_forwards()` raises an exception (which occurs with None schema_editor), the operation object is permanently mutated:
- The old_name and new_name attributes are swapped
- The old_name_lower and new_name_lower cached properties are swapped
- This violates the immutability contract documented in the base class
- Subsequent operations on the same object would be incorrect
