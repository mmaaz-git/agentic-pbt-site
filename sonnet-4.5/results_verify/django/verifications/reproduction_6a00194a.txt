REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. BUG CONFIRMATION
The bug is real and reproducible. When a Signal is created with use_caching=True and send() is called with a non-weakly-referenceable sender (like None, int, str, or plain object()), a TypeError occurs.

2. EXACT ERROR
The error occurs at line 183 in dispatcher.py:
    or self.sender_receivers_cache.get(sender) is NO_RECEIVERS

The traceback shows:
TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'NoneType' object

3. REPRODUCED TEST CASES
All test cases from the bug report were confirmed:
- sender=None: FAILS with TypeError
- sender=object(): FAILS with TypeError
- sender=42: FAILS with TypeError
- sender="string": FAILS with TypeError
- sender=MyClass(): SUCCESS (custom classes support weak references)

4. CONTROL TEST
With use_caching=False, all sender types work correctly, confirming the issue is specifically related to the caching mechanism.

5. HYPOTHESIS TEST
The hypothesis test fails as expected when use_caching=True is tested, confirming the property-based test correctly identifies the bug.

6. ROOT CAUSE
The issue is that on line 47, a WeakKeyDictionary is created when use_caching=True:
    self.sender_receivers_cache = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary() if use_caching else {}

WeakKeyDictionary cannot accept keys that don't support weak references (like None, int, str, or plain object instances). When the code tries to access this cache with such a sender on line 183, it crashes.

The bug is correctly identified and reproducible.
