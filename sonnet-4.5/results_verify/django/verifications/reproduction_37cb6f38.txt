## Reproduction of Django Q Object Idempotence Bug

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. The bug report is accurate in its description and the provided code runs correctly.

### Hypothesis Test Results

The Hypothesis property-based test correctly identified the issue:
- Running `test_q_and_idempotent()` fails with `Q(x=0)` as a falsifying example
- The assertion `(q & q) == q` fails because Q objects do not maintain idempotence

### Manual Reproduction Results

The manual reproduction code executed successfully and produced the exact output claimed in the bug report:

1. **Q Object Structure:**
   - `q` produces: `(AND: ('x', 0))`
   - `q & q` produces: `(AND: ('x', 0), ('x', 0))` - contains duplicate conditions
   - `q | q` produces: `(OR: ('x', 0), ('x', 0))` - contains duplicate conditions

2. **Equality Checks:**
   - `q == (q & q)` returns `False`
   - `q == (q | q)` returns `False`

   These should return `True` if idempotence was properly maintained.

3. **SQL Generation:**
   - `q` generates: `WHERE "test_app_testmodel"."x" = 0`
   - `q & q` generates: `WHERE ("test_app_testmodel"."x" = 0 AND "test_app_testmodel"."x" = 0)`
   - `q | q` generates: `WHERE ("test_app_testmodel"."x" = 0 OR "test_app_testmodel"."x" = 0)`

   The redundant conditions in the SQL are inefficient and unnecessary.

### Effect of the Bug

The bug has the following concrete effects:

1. **Performance Impact:** Redundant SQL conditions are generated, potentially impacting query performance with unnecessary duplicate checks.

2. **Logic Violations:** The Q objects violate the fundamental boolean algebra property of idempotence (x ∧ x = x and x ∨ x = x).

3. **Equality Issues:** Code that relies on Q object equality comparisons will fail when comparing `q` with `q & q` or `q | q`, even though they should be logically equivalent.

4. **Query Deduplication:** Systems that attempt to cache or deduplicate queries may fail to recognize that `q`, `q & q`, and `q | q` represent the same logical condition.

The reproduction confirms that this is a real issue in Django's Q object implementation.
