## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report complains that CheckMessage objects are unhashable, but there is no documentation or evidence suggesting that CheckMessage objects were ever intended to be hashable. The current behavior is exactly what Python's data model specifies should happen when a class implements `__eq__()` without `__hash__()`. The Django codebase shows no usage of CheckMessage objects in sets or as dictionary keys, suggesting this capability was never needed or intended. The user is essentially asking for functionality that was never promised or documented.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies that CheckMessage violates the Python hash/equality contract by implementing `__eq__()` without `__hash__()`. While Python's behavior is correct, the Django class design could be considered incomplete. The objects are effectively immutable (no methods modify state), so there's no technical reason they couldn't be hashable.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a trivial issue that has likely existed since CheckMessage was created, and no one has complained about it before. A search through Django's codebase reveals no usage of CheckMessage objects in sets or dictionaries, indicating this functionality is not actually needed. The use cases mentioned (deduplicating messages, using as dict keys) are hypothetical rather than real requirements. Adding hashability would require careful consideration of the `obj` attribute which might contain unhashable objects.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is relatively simple and would make the class more complete and Pythonic. Having objects that can be compared for equality but not hashed is an inconsistent design that could confuse users. The bug report provides valid use cases where hashability would be useful.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior follows Python's documented rules exactly - when `__eq__()` is defined without `__hash__()`, objects become unhashable. If this is intentional design, the documentation should explicitly state that CheckMessage objects are not hashable and should not be used in sets or as dictionary keys. This would clarify the intended usage and prevent confusion.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There's no incorrect documentation to fix - the documentation simply doesn't mention hashability at all. The behavior is consistent with Python's defaults, which don't need to be explicitly documented for every class. Adding documentation about what the class doesn't support could be excessive.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is asking for new functionality that doesn't currently exist - the ability to use CheckMessage objects in sets and as dictionary keys. This is not fixing broken behavior but adding a new capability. The class works correctly for its current use cases (creating check messages, comparing them), and the user wants to extend its functionality to support additional use cases like deduplication.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Implementing `__hash__()` when `__eq__()` exists could be seen as fixing an incomplete implementation rather than adding a new feature. The Python documentation suggests that classes should either implement both or neither, so this could be considered completing the existing equality functionality rather than adding something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The CheckMessage class violates the principle that objects implementing `__eq__()` should also implement `__hash__()` if they are immutable. The class appears to be immutable in practice, and Python's data model states that such objects should be hashable. This inconsistency could be considered a design bug.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There is no actual broken functionality - the class works exactly as Python specifies it should work when `__eq__()` is defined without `__hash__()`. No documented behavior is violated, no promises are broken, and no existing Django functionality is impaired. The unhashability appears to be either intentional or at least acceptable given that Django never uses these objects in hashable collections.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a FEATURE_REQUEST rather than a bug. The CheckMessage class behaves exactly as Python's data model specifies for classes that override `__eq__()` without `__hash__()`. There is no documentation suggesting these objects should be hashable, and Django's own codebase never attempts to use them in sets or as dictionary keys.

The bug reporter is essentially asking for enhanced functionality - the ability to use CheckMessage objects in hashable collections. While this might be a reasonable enhancement, it's not fixing broken behavior but rather adding new capabilities that were never promised or documented. The current implementation works correctly for all its intended use cases within Django's check framework.

Most importantly, the fact that this limitation has apparently existed since the class was created without causing problems suggests that hashability is not a required feature. The use cases mentioned in the bug report (deduplicating messages, using as dict keys) are hypothetical rather than actual problems encountered in practice. This is classic feature request territory - "it would be nice if..." rather than "this is broken and needs fixing."
