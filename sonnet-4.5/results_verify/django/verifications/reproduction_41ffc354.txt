## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Successful Reproduction
The bug report's claims have been successfully reproduced and verified. The technical details are correct.

### Key Findings

1. **Truncation Confirmed**: DjangoJSONEncoder does indeed truncate microseconds from 6 digits to 3 digits (millisecond precision).
   - Input: 123456 microseconds → Output: 123000 microseconds
   - The last 3 digits are always truncated

2. **Exact Truncation Mechanism**: The code uses string slicing to remove the last 3 digits:
   - For datetime: `r[:23] + r[26:]` removes characters at positions 23-25 (the last 3 microsecond digits)
   - For time: `r[:12]` keeps only up to position 11, removing the last 3 microsecond digits

3. **Data Loss Verified**:
   - Original: `2000-01-01T12:34:56.123456+00:00`
   - Encoded: `2000-01-01T12:34:56.123Z`
   - Reconstructed: `2000-01-01T12:34:56.123000+00:00`
   - The values are NOT equal after round-trip

4. **Systematic Behavior**: Testing multiple values shows consistent truncation:
   - 999999 microseconds → 999000 (loses 999)
   - 500500 microseconds → 500000 (loses 500)
   - 123456 microseconds → 123000 (loses 456)
   - Only values already at millisecond precision (e.g., 123000) are preserved

5. **Both Types Affected**: The truncation affects both:
   - `datetime.datetime` objects (lines 95-96 in the code)
   - `datetime.time` objects (lines 106-107 in the code)

6. **Hypothesis Test Passed**: The property-based test correctly identifies that any datetime with non-zero microseconds that aren't multiples of 1000 will lose precision.

### Comparison with Bug Report
The bug report's technical description is accurate:
- The code locations cited (lines 95-96 and 106-107) are correct
- The truncation behavior described matches exactly
- The example output provided is accurate
- The assertion about data loss is valid

The truncation is intentional (following ECMA-262's millisecond precision), but this behavior is not documented in the DjangoJSONEncoder's docstring or Django's serialization documentation.
