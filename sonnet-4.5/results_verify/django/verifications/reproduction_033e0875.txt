## Reproduction Results

### Bug Confirmation
The bug report is technically accurate. The reproduction tests confirm the reported issue with `get_exception_info` in Django's Jinja2 backend.

### Technical Details

1. **The Bug Exists**:
   - When template source contains leading newlines, `get_exception_info` strips them using `source.strip()` at line 105
   - Jinja2 reports line numbers based on the original source (including empty lines)
   - After stripping, the line numbers no longer correspond to the original source

2. **Reproduction Results**:

   a) **IndexError Case**: With source `"\n\nline 3 content\nline 4 content"` and error at line 3:
      - Original source has 4 lines (2 empty, then 2 with content)
      - After strip(), only 2 lines remain
      - Attempting to access line 3 causes IndexError

   b) **Wrong Line Display**: With source `"\n\nActual line 3\nActual line 4\nActual line 5"` and error at line 3:
      - Original line 3 contains "Actual line 3"
      - After strip(), what was line 3 becomes line 1
      - The function displays line 3 of the stripped source, which is "Actual line 5"
      - This shows the wrong line content to developers

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - The bug can cause crashes (IndexError) when debugging templates with many leading newlines
   - More commonly, it displays incorrect line content in error messages
   - This affects debugging experience when templates have leading/trailing whitespace

4. **Real-World Scenarios**:
   - Templates with heredocs or multiline strings often have leading newlines
   - Generated templates might have whitespace for formatting
   - Templates included from other templates might have extra newlines

### The Proposed Fix
The bug report suggests removing `.strip()` from line 105, changing:
```python
lines = list(enumerate(source.strip().split("\n"), start=1))
```
to:
```python
lines = list(enumerate(source.split("\n"), start=1))
```

This fix would preserve the original line numbering and ensure the correct line is displayed.
