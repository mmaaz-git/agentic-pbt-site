DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR DJANGO FIELD NAMING AND CREATEMODEL.REDUCE()

1. Django Field Naming Convention:
   - Django documentation does not explicitly mandate case-sensitive field naming
   - The documentation recommends lowercase with underscores but doesn't enforce it
   - Field names are used to create database column names (unless db_column is specified)
   - The documentation states "Your code should never have to deal with the database column name"

2. Field Name Case Sensitivity in Django:
   - Django's internal field lookup (`_meta.get_field()`) IS case-sensitive
   - Field names in Python are case-sensitive attributes on the model class
   - Database behavior varies by backend (MySQL case-insensitive by default, PostgreSQL case-sensitive)
   - Django allows defining a field with one case (e.g., 'myField') and referencing it with another case in constraints

3. CreateModel.reduce() Method:
   - No specific documentation found about case sensitivity requirements
   - The method is part of Django's migration optimization system
   - It's used to combine/reduce migration operations for efficiency
   - The code shows it uses exact string comparison (`==`) for field matching

4. Constraints and Field References:
   - Django accepts field names in `unique_together` and `index_together` with different cases than the actual field definition
   - The model validation doesn't enforce case-matching between field definitions and constraint references
   - This creates an inconsistency where a field 'myField' can be referenced as 'MyField' in unique_together

5. Migration System Behavior:
   - Migrations need to handle field renaming across all references
   - The reduce() method attempts to update field names in constraints when fields are renamed
   - No documentation specifies whether this should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive

6. Database-Level Considerations:
   - Different databases handle case sensitivity differently
   - PostgreSQL is case-sensitive for unquoted identifiers (folds to lowercase)
   - MySQL/MariaDB case sensitivity depends on the OS and configuration
   - SQLite is case-insensitive for identifiers
   - Oracle folds unquoted identifiers to uppercase

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly specify how CreateModel.reduce() should handle field name case sensitivity in constraints. There's no clear statement that field references in constraints must match the exact case of field definitions, nor that the reduce() method should perform case-insensitive matching. This is an undocumented edge case where Django accepts mismatched cases in constraint definitions but fails to handle them properly during migration optimization.
