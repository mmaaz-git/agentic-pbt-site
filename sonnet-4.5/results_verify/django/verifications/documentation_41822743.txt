DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS for EmailMessage.attach()

1. DOCSTRING DOCUMENTATION (from source code):
The docstring for EmailMessage.attach() at line 311-312 of django/core/mail/message.py states:
"Attach a file with the given filename and content. The filename can be omitted and the mimetype is guessed, if not provided."

This docstring explicitly states that "The filename can be omitted". This is a clear statement that the filename parameter should be optional.

2. METHOD SIGNATURE:
def attach(self, filename=None, content=None, mimetype=None):

The method signature shows that filename defaults to None, which further suggests that None is intended to be a valid value.

3. DJANGO OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
The Django official documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/email/) provides examples of using attach() but does not explicitly clarify whether filename can be None. The examples shown use actual filenames like:
message.attach("design.png", img_data, "image/png")

However, the documentation does not contradict the docstring's claim that filename can be omitted.

4. CODE IMPLEMENTATION:
The actual implementation at line 333 calls:
mimetype = mimetype or mimetypes.guess_type(filename)[0] or DEFAULT_ATTACHMENT_MIME_TYPE

The mimetypes.guess_type() function from Python's standard library expects a string, bytes, or os.PathLike object, not None. This is where the TypeError occurs.

5. SPECIAL CASE - MIMEBase:
The method also accepts a MIMEBase instance as the first parameter (lines 321-327), which is a different usage pattern entirely. This doesn't affect the None filename issue.

6. EMAILATTACHMENT STRUCTURE:
EmailAttachment is defined as a namedtuple with fields: filename, content, mimetype (line 195). This structure can technically accept None as a filename value, as namedtuples don't enforce type constraints.

CONCLUSION FROM DOCUMENTATION:
The docstring clearly and explicitly states that "The filename can be omitted", and the method signature defaults filename to None. This creates a reasonable expectation that passing filename=None should work. The implementation, however, does not handle this case properly, causing a TypeError when mimetypes.guess_type() is called with None.
