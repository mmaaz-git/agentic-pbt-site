## Documentation Analysis for CaseInsensitiveMapping

### Class Documentation

The CaseInsensitiveMapping class in django/utils/datastructures.py has the following documentation:

```
Mapping allowing case-insensitive key lookups. Original case of keys is
preserved for iteration and string representation.
```

The documentation provides a simple example with ASCII characters ('name', 'Name', 'NAME') but does not mention:
- Unicode handling
- Non-ASCII character support
- Limitations with certain character sets
- The specific method used for case normalization

### Key Findings

1. **No Unicode-specific documentation**: The class documentation does not explicitly state how Unicode characters are handled or whether they are supported.

2. **Implementation uses .lower()**: The source code shows that the class uses Python's `.lower()` method for normalization, not `.casefold()` which is the Unicode-aware case folding method.

3. **Implicit contract**: The documentation states it provides "case-insensitive key lookups" without qualifying this statement with any limitations.

4. **Usage context**: The class is primarily used for HTTP headers in Django (HttpHeaders and ResponseHeaders classes inherit from it). HTTP headers are ASCII-based per RFC specifications, so Unicode edge cases may not have been a primary design consideration.

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not specify:
- Whether the class is intended to work with all Unicode characters
- What happens with characters that have asymmetric case transformations
- Whether it follows Unicode case folding standards
- Any limitations with non-ASCII character sets

### Reasonable User Expectations

Given that the documentation states "case-insensitive key lookups" without qualification, users would reasonably expect:
1. If a key can be stored, it should be retrievable using any case variation
2. The behavior should be consistent with Unicode standards for case-insensitive matching
3. Common Unicode characters (like German 'ÃŸ') should work correctly

### Conclusion

The documentation is incomplete regarding Unicode handling. While the class works correctly for ASCII and many Unicode characters, it fails for characters with asymmetric case transformations. This is either a bug in the implementation or a gap in the documentation that should clarify the limitations.
