## Official Documentation Review

### Parameter Description for step_factor

From the official SciPy documentation (both online and built-in help):

```
step_factor : float, default: 2.0
    The factor by which the step size is *reduced* in each iteration; i.e.
    the step size in iteration 1 is ``initial_step/step_factor``. If
    ``step_factor < 1``, subsequent steps will be greater than the initial
    step; this may be useful if steps smaller than some threshold are
    undesirable (e.g. due to subtractive cancellation error).
```

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **No Explicit Restriction on step_factor=1.0**
   - The documentation states the parameter controls how step size is "reduced"
   - It explicitly discusses values < 1 (which increase step size)
   - It does NOT mention that step_factor=1.0 is invalid or problematic
   - No warning about singular matrix issues with step_factor=1.0

2. **Input Validation Documentation**
   - The documentation mentions that tolerances and step parameters must be "non-negative scalars"
   - This is enforced in the code (lines 27-33) but only checks >= 0, not != 1.0

3. **Mathematical Context**
   - The documentation describes step_factor as reducing step size by division
   - When step_factor=1.0, the step size never changes (initial_step/1.0 = initial_step)
   - This creates a degenerate case not mentioned in the documentation

4. **Expected Behavior**
   - Based on the documentation, a user would reasonably expect:
     - step_factor=1.0 to be valid (no restriction stated)
     - The function to either work or provide a clear error message
     - Not to encounter a low-level linear algebra error

5. **Documentation Gaps**
   - No mention that step_factor must not equal 1.0
   - No explanation of why 1.0 would be problematic
   - No guidance on handling edge cases near 1.0

## Comparison with Similar Functions

Other numerical differentiation libraries typically either:
1. Document restrictions on step reduction factors
2. Handle the edge case gracefully
3. Provide meaningful error messages for invalid parameters

## Conclusion

The documentation does NOT indicate that step_factor=1.0 is invalid. A reasonable user following the documentation would expect this value to be accepted. The crash with an obscure "Singular matrix" error represents either:
1. A BUG - the code should handle this case
2. A DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the docs should warn about this restriction

Given that the function performs input validation on step_factor but misses this critical case, and that the error occurs deep in the mathematical computation rather than at the interface level, this appears to be a code bug rather than a documentation issue.
