BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report assumes that Q objects should follow boolean algebra properties for equality comparison, but the Django documentation never makes this claim. Q objects are designed for building SQL queries, not as a general-purpose boolean algebra implementation. The documentation only states they can be "combined logically" for query construction, not that their Python-level equality should follow mathematical laws. The current behavior (structural equality) is consistent and predictable - two Q objects are equal if they have the exact same structure, including order.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The technical claims in the bug report are accurate - Q objects do not satisfy commutativity for equality. The reporter correctly identified the root cause and provided working test cases. The behavior is surprising to users who expect logical operators to follow standard boolean algebra properties.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This behavior has likely existed for many Django versions without causing significant issues. The primary purpose of Q objects is to generate correct SQL queries, which they do successfully - Q(id=0) & Q(id=1) and Q(id=1) & Q(id=0) generate equivalent SQL. Changing equality semantics could break existing code that relies on the current structural comparison. The fix would add complexity (sorting children) that could impact performance for a theoretical concern that doesn't affect actual query execution.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue violates user expectations about logical operations. The inconsistency between keyword argument handling (which sorts) and operator combination (which doesn't) is confusing. This could lead to subtle bugs in user code that compares Q objects.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state how Q object equality works or that it's order-dependent. Adding a note that Q objects use structural equality (not logical equivalence) would clarify the behavior. The documentation could explain that while Q(a=1) & Q(b=2) and Q(b=2) & Q(a=1) generate equivalent SQL, they are not considered equal as Python objects.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current documentation doesn't make false claims about boolean algebra properties. It focuses appropriately on Q objects' primary purpose - building queries. Adding technical details about equality comparison might confuse users who just want to build queries.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report is essentially requesting a new feature - semantic equality comparison for Q objects based on logical equivalence rather than structural equality. This would be an enhancement to make Q objects behave more like a boolean algebra system. It's not fixing broken functionality but adding new behavior that some users desire.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The report frames this as a bug (violation of expected behavior) rather than requesting new functionality. The reporter provides specific failing test cases and proposed fixes, treating it as incorrect behavior rather than a missing feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The inconsistency is real - Q objects created with keyword arguments sort their children (ensuring order-independent equality) while Q objects combined with operators don't. This inconsistency could be considered a bug. Users reasonably expect logical AND and OR operations to be commutative for equality comparison.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation never promises boolean algebra properties. The current behavior is intentional and consistent - it compares the exact structure of Q objects. For the primary use case (generating SQL queries), the system works correctly. The equality comparison accurately reflects whether two Q objects have the identical structure.

**Overall consideration**
This bug report highlights a genuine inconsistency in Django's Q object implementation, where equality comparison is order-dependent for operator-combined Q objects but order-independent for keyword-argument Q objects. However, this is fundamentally a design decision about what Q object equality means - structural equivalence vs. logical equivalence.

The documentation never promises that Q objects form a proper boolean algebra with standard properties like commutativity. Q objects are designed as a DSL for building SQL queries, not as a general mathematical abstraction. The current structural equality is valid, consistent, and predictable - it just doesn't match some users' expectations.

Most importantly, this doesn't affect the core functionality of Q objects. Whether you write Q(id=0) & Q(id=1) or Q(id=1) & Q(id=0), you get the same SQL query and the same database results. The only impact is on Python-level equality comparison, which is rarely used in practice compared to actually executing queries. Given that fixing this would require changes to core equality semantics that could break backward compatibility, and the issue doesn't affect actual query functionality, this should be closed as INVALID - the current behavior, while perhaps surprising, is not incorrect given what the documentation actually promises.
