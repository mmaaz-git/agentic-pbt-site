## Bug Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Test Results:

1. **Mixed-type keys (int and string)**: `{1: 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`
   - Result: **FAILED** with TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
   - This matches exactly what the bug report claims

2. **Integer keys only**: `{1: 'value1', 2: 'value2'}`
   - Result: **SUCCESS** - Serialized correctly

3. **String keys only**: `{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`
   - Result: **SUCCESS** - Serialized correctly

4. **Property test example**: `{1: 10, 'a': 20}`
   - Result: **FAILED** with TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
   - This confirms the Hypothesis test failure

### Technical Details:

The bug occurs at line 129 of django/db/migrations/serializer.py where `sorted(self.value.items())` is called without a key function. In Python 3, comparing incompatible types (int vs str) raises a TypeError.

### Fix Verification:

I tested the proposed fix of using `sorted(self.value.items(), key=lambda item: repr(item[0]))` and confirmed:
- All mixed-type dictionaries serialize successfully
- Round-trip serialization/deserialization works correctly
- Serialization order is deterministic
- The fix is consistent with BaseUnorderedSequenceSerializer which uses `key=repr`

The bug is technically valid and the proposed fix works correctly.
