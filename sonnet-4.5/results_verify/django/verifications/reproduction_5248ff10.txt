## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully ran both the basic reproduction test and the Hypothesis property-based test provided in the bug report. The results confirm the technical accuracy of the bug report.

### Basic Test Results
- **Input**: uri="/page/", referer="http://example.com/page", domain="example.com"
- **Expected**: is_ignorable_request should return True (indicating this is an internal APPEND_SLASH redirect)
- **Actual**: is_ignorable_request returns False

### Root Cause Verification
The comparison on line 165 of django/middleware/common.py:
```python
if settings.APPEND_SLASH and uri.endswith("/") and referer == uri[:-1]:
```

This compares:
- `referer` = "http://example.com/page" (full URL from HTTP Referer header)
- `uri[:-1]` = "/page" (path without trailing slash)

These strings are fundamentally different types:
- One is a complete URL with scheme and domain
- One is just a path

The comparison will ALWAYS fail when given real HTTP Referer headers.

### Property-Based Test Results
The Hypothesis test failed on the first generated example and would fail on ALL examples. This demonstrates the bug is not edge-case specific but affects 100% of cases where APPEND_SLASH redirects occur.

### Additional Test Cases
I tested multiple scenarios:
1. Simple paths: /foo/ with referer http://example.com/foo
2. Nested paths: /bar/baz/ with referer https://example.com/bar/baz
3. Root path: / with referer http://example.com
4. Different schemes: both http and https
5. Subdomains: subdomain.example.com

ALL cases failed because the fundamental comparison logic is incorrect.

### Impact Assessment
This bug means that whenever Django's APPEND_SLASH feature redirects from a URL without a trailing slash to one with a trailing slash:
1. The redirect is successful (user sees the correct page)
2. But BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware incorrectly treats this as a broken link
3. Site managers receive unnecessary email notifications

This would affect any Django site with:
- `APPEND_SLASH = True` (Django's default)
- `BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware` enabled
- `DEBUG = False` (production sites)

The bug report's technical analysis is completely accurate.
