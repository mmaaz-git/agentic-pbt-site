## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Summary
The bug report claims that `is_broken_pipe_error()` in Django's basehttp module crashes with a `TypeError` when called without an active exception context.

### Reproduction Steps Performed

1. **Located the source code**: Found the function in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/servers/basehttp.py` at lines 56-65.

2. **Examined the function implementation**:
```python
def is_broken_pipe_error():
    exc_type, _, _ = sys.exc_info()
    return issubclass(
        exc_type,
        (
            BrokenPipeError,
            ConnectionAbortedError,
            ConnectionResetError,
        ),
    )
```

3. **Reproduced the bug**: Called the function without an active exception:
   - Result: `TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class`
   - This confirms the reported behavior - when no exception is active, `sys.exc_info()` returns `(None, None, None)`, making `exc_type` equal to `None`, which causes `issubclass(None, ...)` to raise a TypeError.

4. **Ran the provided Hypothesis test**: The test failed with the same TypeError, confirming the bug.

### Current Usage Context
The function is only called once in the codebase, inside `WSGIServer.handle_error()` method (line 80):
```python
def handle_error(self, request, client_address):
    if is_broken_pipe_error():
        logger.info("- Broken pipe from %s", client_address)
    else:
        super().handle_error(request, client_address)
```

The `handle_error` method is typically called by the socketserver framework when an exception occurs during request handling, which means there SHOULD always be an active exception when `is_broken_pipe_error()` is called in the current codebase.

### Reproduction Confirmed
The bug is reproducible exactly as described in the report. The function crashes with a TypeError when called without an active exception context.
