DOCUMENTATION REVIEW FINDINGS

1. Django BaseEmailBackend Documentation:

The Django source code documentation states:
- Lines 10-15: "open() and close() can be called indirectly by using a backend object as a context manager"
- Line 22-37: open() method documentation states "Open a network connection" and "The default implementation does nothing"
- Line 41: close() method documentation simply states "Close a network connection"

The documentation does NOT specify:
- What should happen if open() raises an exception
- What should happen if close() raises an exception during cleanup
- How exceptions should be handled in the __enter__ method
- Whether the original exception should be preserved if cleanup also fails

2. Python Context Manager Best Practices (PEP 343):

PEP 343 and related Python documentation establish:
- Resource acquisition should ideally happen in __init__, not __enter__
- __enter__ should rarely raise exceptions
- If __enter__ fails partway through, proper cleanup is essential
- The contextlib module provides ExitStack for complex cleanup scenarios
- Exception chaining and preservation of original exceptions is considered best practice

Key quote from best practices: "If there is the chance that an exception could occur in __enter__() then you will need to catch it yourself and call a helper function that contains the cleanup code."

3. Current Implementation Analysis:

The current Django implementation (lines 44-50) does:
```python
def __enter__(self):
    try:
        self.open()
    except Exception:
        self.close()  # This can raise and mask the original exception
        raise
    return self
```

4. Documentation Gap:

The documentation does not explicitly specify the expected behavior when:
- Both open() and close() raise exceptions
- Whether exception masking is intentional or acceptable
- How cleanup failures should be handled

The documentation is silent on exception handling semantics in the context manager protocol implementation.
