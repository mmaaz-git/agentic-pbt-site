## Documentation Analysis for incr_version Method

After reviewing Django's official documentation and source code, here is what I found:

### Method Documentation
The `incr_version` method has the following docstring in the source code:
```
Add delta to the cache version for the supplied key. Return the new version.
```

### Method Signature
`incr_version(self, key, delta=1, version=None)`

Parameters:
- `key`: The cache key to operate on
- `delta`: The amount to increment the version by (default: 1)
- `version`: The specific version to operate on (optional, defaults to cache's default version)

### What the Documentation Says
1. The method "adds delta to the cache version" - this suggests it increments the version number by the specified delta amount
2. The method returns the new version number
3. The documentation example shows incrementing a version and demonstrates that the old version becomes unavailable while the new version contains the cached value

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say
1. **No explicit behavior defined for delta=0**: The documentation does not specify what should happen when delta is 0
2. **No validation requirements**: The documentation doesn't specify any restrictions on delta values (e.g., must be positive, non-zero, etc.)
3. **No explicit guarantee about value preservation**: While the examples show the value being preserved at the new version, there's no explicit statement about what happens when delta=0

### Related Methods
- `decr_version(key, delta=1, version=None)`: Subtracts delta from the version, implemented as `incr_version(key, -delta, version)`
- This shows that negative deltas are intended to be supported

### Implementation Details from Source
The implementation shows:
1. Get the value at the current version
2. Set the value at version + delta
3. Delete the value at the original version
4. Return version + delta

### Key Observation
The documentation does not explicitly define the behavior for delta=0. The method name "incr_version" (increment version) semantically suggests changing the version, but doesn't explicitly forbid delta=0. The fact that `decr_version` uses negative delta values shows the method is designed to handle various delta values, potentially including 0.
