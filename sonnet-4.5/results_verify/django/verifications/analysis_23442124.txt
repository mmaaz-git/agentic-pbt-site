## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report assumes that CaseInsensitiveMapping should handle all Unicode case transformations perfectly, but the documentation never explicitly promises Unicode support. The examples only show ASCII characters, and one could argue that "case-insensitive" might implicitly mean ASCII-only in the context of web frameworks where HTTP headers (a common use case) are traditionally ASCII. The implementation uses lower(), which is a standard Python approach that works for most practical cases.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The class makes a general promise of "case-insensitive key lookups" without any documented restrictions. In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, and users reasonably expect string operations to work with Unicode unless explicitly documented otherwise. The bug demonstrably breaks the promised behavior - accessing a key with its upper-case form fails, which violates the core promise of case-insensitive access.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case involving the MICRO SIGN character (µ) which has unusual Unicode properties. The character is relatively obscure in practical Django applications. The current implementation works correctly for ASCII and most common Unicode characters. Fixing this might introduce performance overhead or backward compatibility issues for a problem that affects very few users in practice.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue affects multiple Unicode characters beyond just µ, including Turkish letters and German ß, which are used in real-world applications. Django is an international framework used globally, and proper Unicode support is expected. The fix (using casefold()) is straightforward and is the Python-recommended approach for case-insensitive string comparison. This is not just a trivial edge case but a correctness issue.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior using lower() is reasonable and works for the vast majority of use cases. Rather than changing the implementation, the documentation could be updated to clarify that the class provides "ASCII case-insensitive lookups" or note that certain Unicode characters may not work as expected. This would set proper expectations without risking backward compatibility breaks from changing the implementation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The implementation is genuinely broken for its stated purpose. Documenting a limitation doesn't fix the fact that the class fails to deliver on its core promise. Users need true case-insensitive lookups, not documented excuses for why certain characters don't work. The class name itself would be misleading if it doesn't actually provide case-insensitive access for valid string inputs.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Full Unicode case-insensitive support could be seen as an enhancement rather than a bug fix. The current implementation provides the documented behavior for ASCII cases shown in the examples. Adding Unicode support would be extending the functionality beyond what was originally demonstrated, making it a new feature rather than fixing broken behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The class already claims to provide "case-insensitive key lookups" - it's not asking for new functionality but for the existing functionality to work correctly. The bug report isn't requesting a new feature but pointing out that the current feature doesn't work as advertised. Case-insensitive access is the sole purpose of this class, not an additional feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The class explicitly promises "case-insensitive key lookups" but fails to deliver this for valid Unicode strings. The failure is not an edge case of unusual input but a fundamental breakdown of the advertised behavior - you cannot access a key using its uppercase form, which is the definition of case-insensitive access. The Python documentation recommends casefold() for case-insensitive comparisons, and Django's implementation uses the inferior lower() method. The fix is straightforward and makes the code work as documented.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The implementation works correctly for the documented ASCII examples, and lower() is a common, acceptable approach for case normalization in many contexts. The Unicode edge cases might be considered outside the intended scope, especially since Django often deals with HTTP headers and URLs where ASCII is predominant. The behavioral change might break existing code that depends on the current lower() behavior.

## Overall Consideration
After examining the documentation, code, and test results, this appears to be a legitimate bug. The CaseInsensitiveMapping class makes an unqualified promise to provide "case-insensitive key lookups" but fails to do so for certain valid Unicode characters. The failure is not due to invalid input or unreasonable expectations, but because the implementation uses str.lower() instead of str.casefold(), which is Python's recommended method for case-insensitive string matching.

The bug affects real-world characters used in various languages (Turkish, German), not just obscure symbols. While the MICRO SIGN might seem esoteric, it demonstrates a fundamental flaw that impacts multiple Unicode characters. Django is an international framework, and proper Unicode handling is a reasonable expectation in modern Python applications. The documentation makes no disclaimer about Unicode limitations, and in Python 3's Unicode-by-default world, users rightfully expect string operations to handle Unicode correctly.

The proposed fix using casefold() is the correct approach according to Python's own documentation for case-insensitive string comparison. While casefold() doesn't solve every Unicode edge case (like Turkish i/I), it handles the reported issue and improves correctness significantly. This is a bug that should be fixed rather than documented away or dismissed as an edge case.
