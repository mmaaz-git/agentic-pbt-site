Bug Triage Analysis for ErrorDict.copy() Renderer Preservation
==============================================================

## Analysis of Each Triage Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence For:**
1. The bug is reproducible and affects core functionality
2. ErrorList in the same module implements copy() correctly, preserving renderer
3. The renderer attribute is essential for ErrorDict's rendering functionality
4. Users reasonably expect copy() to create a functionally equivalent object
5. The inconsistency between ErrorDict and ErrorList suggests an oversight
6. The proposed fix is simple, follows established patterns, and has no side effects

**Evidence Against:**
- No explicit documentation stating copy() must preserve renderer

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Evidence For:**
- dict.copy() behavior is technically correct (shallow copy of dict data only)
- No explicit documentation promising renderer preservation

**Evidence Against:**
- The bug demonstrably exists and breaks expected functionality
- ErrorList already implements the expected behavior
- The renderer is a core attribute, not an optional enhancement

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Evidence For:**
- Could be worked around by manually setting renderer after copy

**Evidence Against:**
- Not a trivial edge case - affects core form rendering functionality
- Breaks consistency within the same module
- Easy to fix with minimal code change

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Evidence For:**
- Could be argued that preserving renderer is an enhancement

**Evidence Against:**
- ErrorList already has this "feature" - it's an expected behavior
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
- The renderer parameter exists in __init__, suggesting it should be preserved

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error)
**Evidence For:**
- Documentation doesn't specify the behavior either way

**Evidence Against:**
- The code behavior is incorrect, not the documentation
- Adding documentation wouldn't fix the inconsistency with ErrorList

## Severity Assessment

**Impact:** Medium
- Affects form rendering functionality
- Can cause unexpected behavior in production code
- Silent failure (no error, just missing attribute)

**Scope:** Limited but important
- Only affects code that copies ErrorDict objects
- But ErrorDict is a core Django forms component

**Fix Complexity:** Trivial
- 5-line addition following existing pattern
- No breaking changes or side effects

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG** that should remain open and be fixed:

1. **Consistency**: ErrorList.copy() preserves renderer, ErrorDict.copy() doesn't - clear inconsistency
2. **Functionality**: The renderer is essential for the object to work correctly
3. **User Expectations**: Reasonable to expect copy() to preserve essential attributes
4. **Easy Fix**: The solution is trivial and follows established patterns
5. **No Downside**: The fix has no negative impact on existing code

The lack of explicit documentation doesn't make this invalid - it's a clear oversight where ErrorDict didn't get the same copy() implementation as ErrorList when the renderer attribute was added.
