## Documentation Analysis

### Official Django Documentation

The Django documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/checks/ states:
- "You can pass as many tags to `register` as you want in order to label your check."
- It shows examples of registering checks with multiple tags in a single call
- It does NOT explicitly mention whether the same check can be registered multiple times with different tags

### Source Code Documentation

The docstring in `/django/core/checks/registry.py` for the `register()` method shows:
```python
@registry.register('mytag', 'anothertag')
def my_check(app_configs, **kwargs):
    # ... perform checks and collect `errors` ...
    return errors
# or
registry.register(my_check, 'mytag', 'anothertag')
```

This example clearly shows the intended way to register a check with multiple tags is to pass all tags in a single `register()` call.

### Key Findings

1. **No explicit documentation about multiple registrations**: Neither the official documentation nor the code comments explicitly state what should happen if the same check function is registered multiple times with different tags.

2. **Implied behavior from examples**: All examples show registering with multiple tags in a single call, not through multiple registrations.

3. **Current implementation allows multiple tags**: The system clearly supports a check having multiple tags, as shown in test 1 where `register(my_check, "tag1", "tag2")` works correctly.

4. **Documentation gap**: There is no warning or note that registering the same check multiple times will overwrite previous tags rather than accumulate them.

### Comparison with User Expectations

The bug reporter states: "A user might reasonably expect to be able to register the same check function under multiple tags by calling `register()` multiple times."

This is a reasonable expectation because:
1. Many registration systems accumulate or merge when the same item is registered multiple times
2. Since checks are stored in a set (which handles uniqueness), users might expect the tags to accumulate
3. The documentation doesn't explicitly warn against this pattern

### Workaround Available

The documentation and examples show the correct way to register a check with multiple tags:
```python
registry.register(my_check, "tag1", "tag2", "tag3")  # All tags in one call
```

This works as expected and the check is accessible via all specified tags.
