DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

METHOD: django.apps.config.AppConfig.create(entry)

PURPOSE (from source code docstring):
"Factory that creates an app config from an entry in INSTALLED_APPS."

DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS
----------------------

1. Official Django Documentation:
   - The AppConfig.create() method is NOT documented in the public Django documentation
   - The method appears to be an internal/private API (uses @classmethod but not in public docs)
   - Django docs only describe how users should define AppConfig subclasses, not use create()

2. Source Code Documentation:
   The method's docstring states it creates an AppConfig from an INSTALLED_APPS entry.

   Expected behavior from code analysis:
   - Accepts a string entry that can be:
     a) A module path (e.g., "django.contrib.auth")
     b) A full class path (e.g., "myapp.apps.MyAppConfig")

   - Returns an AppConfig instance

   - Raises ImportError or ImproperlyConfigured for invalid entries

3. Error Handling Intent:
   Lines 168-193 show deliberate error handling with helpful messages:
   - If entry looks like a class name (starts with uppercase), provides suggestions
   - If entry looks like a module, re-triggers the import error
   - Goal is to provide "nice error message in both cases"

4. Edge Cases:
   - No documentation specifies what should happen with trailing dots
   - The code comment says "provide a nice error message" but IndexError is not nice
   - No specification that entries must not end with dots

5. API Contract:
   Since this is an internal method (not in public docs), the exact behavior for edge
   cases is not part of a public contract. However, the code clearly intends to
   provide helpful error messages for invalid inputs.

CONCLUSION
----------
The documentation does not specify behavior for entries ending with dots. However,
the code's intent (from comments) is to provide helpful error messages for invalid
entries. An IndexError is inconsistent with this documented intent.
