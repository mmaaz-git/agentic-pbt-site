DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
   The is_same_domain() function has minimal public documentation:

   Docstring (from source code):
   """
   Return ``True`` if the host is either an exact match or a match
   to the wildcard pattern.

   Any pattern beginning with a period matches a domain and all of its
   subdomains. (e.g. ``.example.com`` matches ``example.com`` and
   ``foo.example.com``). Anything else is an exact string match.
   """

   Key observations:
   - The docstring says "exact string match" but doesn't specify case sensitivity
   - No mention of DNS standards or case-insensitive comparison
   - Function is not documented in Django's official API documentation (appears to be internal)

2. USAGE CONTEXT IN DJANGO:

   a) validate_host() function explicitly documents:
      "Note: This function assumes that the given host is lowercased and has
      already had the port, if any, stripped off."

      This function pre-processes the host via split_domain_port() which lowercases it,
      so validate_host() works correctly.

   b) CSRF middleware uses is_same_domain() directly with:
      - request_netloc from urlsplit() - which preserves original case
      - This means CSRF checks could fail with mixed-case domains

3. DNS STANDARDS (RFC 1035):

   RFC 1035 explicitly states:
   - "For all parts of the DNS that are part of the official protocol, all comparisons
     between character strings (e.g., labels, domain names, etc.) are done in a
     case-insensitive manner."
   - "Name servers and resolvers must compare labels in a case-insensitive manner
     (i.e., A=a), assuming ASCII with zero parity."

4. CONCLUSION ON DOCUMENTATION:

   The function's behavior contradicts DNS standards. While the documentation doesn't
   explicitly promise case-insensitive comparison, the function name "is_same_domain"
   and its purpose (domain matching) strongly implies it should follow DNS conventions.

   The fact that some Django code (validate_host) assumes pre-normalized input while
   other code (CSRF middleware) doesn't, creates inconsistency and potential bugs.

   This is not a documentation error - the code implementation is incorrect for a
   domain comparison function.
