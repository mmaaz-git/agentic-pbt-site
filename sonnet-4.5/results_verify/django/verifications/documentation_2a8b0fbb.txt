## Documentation Analysis for apps.get_model()

### Official Documentation Review

From Django's official documentation and source code docstring:

1. **Method Signature**: `apps.get_model(app_label, model_name=None, require_ready=True)`

2. **Docstring (lines 189-198 in registry.py)**:
   ```
   Return the model matching the given app_label and model_name.

   As a shortcut, app_label may be in the form <app_label>.<model_name>.

   model_name is case-insensitive.

   Raise LookupError if no application exists with this label, or no
   model exists with this name in the application. Raise ValueError if
   called with a single argument that doesn't contain exactly one dot.
   ```

3. **Key Documentation Points**:
   - The function explicitly documents that it raises ValueError for single arguments without exactly one dot
   - The documentation does NOT specify what the error message should contain
   - The documentation does NOT promise a user-friendly error message

### Documentation vs Implementation Analysis

1. **What's Promised**:
   - The function will raise ValueError when called with single argument lacking exactly one dot
   - This is being fulfilled - a ValueError IS raised

2. **What's NOT Promised**:
   - No specific error message format is documented
   - No promise of user-friendly error messages
   - No requirement that the error message explain the format requirement

3. **Documentation Completeness**:
   - The documentation correctly describes WHAT exception is raised
   - The documentation does not describe HOW the error is presented to users
   - From a strict contract perspective, the implementation follows the documentation

### Related Django Standards

While not explicitly documented for this specific function, Django generally follows patterns of providing helpful error messages throughout the framework. Many Django errors include:
- Context about what went wrong
- Guidance on how to fix the issue
- The actual value that caused the problem

### Conclusion

The documentation is technically correct - it promises a ValueError and delivers one. However, the documentation doesn't specify the quality or content of the error message. The bug report's complaint is about the QUALITY of the error message, not whether the correct exception type is raised.

This is a gray area where:
- The strict API contract (raise ValueError) is met
- The user experience expectation (clear error messages) is not met
- Django's general practice of helpful error messages sets an expectation not met here
