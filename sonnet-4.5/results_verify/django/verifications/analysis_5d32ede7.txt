## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it IS a bug:**
- Violates explicit API contract: BaseEmailBackend docstring clearly states the method should "return the number of email messages sent"
- Causes type inconsistency: Returns NoneType instead of int, breaking type expectations
- Breaks backend substitutability: Cannot transparently swap console/filebased with smtp/locmem backends
- Causes runtime errors: Code expecting integer return values will fail with TypeError
- Inconsistent with other backends: SMTP and locmem correctly return 0

**Why it might NOT be a bug:**
- No evidence against this being a bug

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue that None semantically means "no operation performed"
- However, this is contradicted by the explicit documentation

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- Documentation is explicit about return type being a number
- Other backends demonstrate the correct behavior
- The API contract is clear and unambiguous

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Empty message lists might be considered an edge case
- Console/filebased backends are primarily for development/testing

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty lists are common in programming
- The fix is trivial (return 0 instead of return)
- Breaks real code that relies on the return value
- Violates a documented API contract
- Affects production use cases (filebased backend can be used in production)

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could update docs to say "returns number of messages or None for empty lists"

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current documentation is correct and clear
- Other backends follow the documented behavior
- Changing documentation would break backward compatibility for correct implementations
- The code is wrong, not the documentation

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be seen as requesting consistent behavior across backends

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The expected behavior is already documented
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding features

### Conclusion
This is clearly a BUG. The code violates its documented contract, causes type errors, and breaks backend substitutability. The fix is trivial and the bug has real impact on users who rely on the return value of send_messages().
