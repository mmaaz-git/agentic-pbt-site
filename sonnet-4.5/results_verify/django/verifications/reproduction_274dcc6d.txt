## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

1. **The bug report's claim is technically correct:**
   - `Substr` does NOT validate the `length` parameter
   - `Substr(Value("hello"), 1, 0)` and `Substr(Value("hello"), 1, -5)` execute without raising exceptions
   - `Left` DOES validate its `length` parameter
   - `Left(Value("hello"), 0)` and `Left(Value("hello"), -5)` raise ValueError: "'length' must be greater than 0."

2. **Behavior of other similar functions:**
   - `LPad`: Allows `length=0` but rejects negative values (raises ValueError for length < 0)
   - `Repeat`: Allows `times=0` but rejects negative values (raises ValueError for number < 0)
   - Both validate their numeric parameters, though with different constraints than Left

3. **SQL Database Behavior:**
   - SQLite (tested): `SUBSTR` with zero or negative length returns an empty string - NO ERROR
   - The SQL executes successfully at the database level
   - Results in empty strings rather than database errors

### Key Findings

1. **The inconsistency exists:** Left validates that length > 0, while Substr doesn't validate length at all
2. **No database errors occur:** SQLite handles negative/zero lengths gracefully by returning empty strings
3. **The bug report's claim about "database errors" is incorrect** - the SQL executes fine
4. **There IS an API inconsistency** between similar functions in the same module

### Technical Accuracy of Bug Report

- ✓ Correct: Substr doesn't validate length parameter
- ✓ Correct: Left does validate length parameter
- ✓ Correct: There's an inconsistency between the two functions
- ✗ Incorrect: "would likely cause errors when the SQL query is executed" - This is false for SQLite
- ? Questionable: Whether this violates "expected API contract" - no contract was documented
