REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report using both the Hypothesis test and the manual reproduction code.

1. Hypothesis Test Results:
   - The test correctly identified that mail_admins() returns None instead of an integer
   - The test failed with the assertion: "Expected int, got <class 'NoneType'>"
   - This confirms the inconsistency with send_mail() which returns an integer

2. Manual Test Results:
   Running the provided reproduction code produced:
   - send_mail() returned: 1 (type: <class 'int'>)
   - mail_admins() returned: None (type: <class 'NoneType'>)
   - mail_managers() returned: None (type: <class 'NoneType'>)

3. Source Code Verification:
   Examining django/core/mail/__init__.py confirms the issue:

   - Line 92: send_mail() ends with "return mail.send()"
   - Line 119: send_mass_mail() ends with "return connection.send_messages(messages)"
   - Line 139: mail_admins() ends with "mail.send(fail_silently=fail_silently)" (no return)
   - Line 159: mail_managers() ends with "mail.send(fail_silently=fail_silently)" (no return)

   The mail.send() method does return an integer (the number of messages sent), but
   mail_admins() and mail_managers() don't capture and return this value.

4. Impact:
   The bug accurately describes the issue. Users cannot programmatically determine
   whether emails sent via mail_admins() or mail_managers() were successful, unlike
   with send_mail() and send_mass_mail() where they can check the return value.

The bug report is accurate and the reproduction steps work correctly.
