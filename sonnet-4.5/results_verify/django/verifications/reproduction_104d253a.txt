BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

1. TEST EXECUTION:

I successfully ran the reproduction code provided in the bug report. The tests confirm that both RenameModel and RenameIndex operations exhibit the reported behavior.

2. RENAMEMODEL BEHAVIOR:

Test Case 1 - RenameModel(old_name='Author', new_name='Writer'):
- Initial state: old_name='Author', new_name='Writer'
- After database_backwards() with exception: old_name='Writer', new_name='Author'
- Result: STATE WAS MUTATED ❌

Test Case 2 - RenameModel(old_name='A', new_name='B'):
- Initial state: old_name='A', new_name='B'
- After database_backwards() with exception: old_name='B', new_name='A'
- Result: STATE WAS MUTATED ❌

3. RENAMEINDEX BEHAVIOR:

Test Case - RenameIndex(model_name='TestModel', old_name='idx_old', new_name='idx_new'):
- Initial state: old_name='idx_old', new_name='idx_new'
- After database_backwards() with exception: old_name='idx_new', new_name='idx_old'
- Result: STATE WAS MUTATED ❌

4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

The code inspection confirms the bug report's analysis. Both operations use a problematic swap-mutate-swap-back pattern:

RenameModel.database_backwards() (lines 538-551):
1. Swaps old_name and new_name (lines 539-543)
2. Calls database_forwards() (line 545)
3. Swaps back (lines 547-551)

If step 2 raises an exception, step 3 never executes, leaving the operation in a mutated state.

RenameIndex.database_backwards() (lines 1140-1157):
- Uses the identical pattern with the same vulnerability

5. EXCEPTION SCENARIOS:

The bug manifests when database_forwards() raises an exception, which can occur in several realistic scenarios:
- schema_editor is None (as in test cases or dry runs)
- Database connection issues
- Permission errors
- Schema conflicts
- Migrations being tested or validated without actual database operations

6. IMPACT VERIFICATION:

The mutation affects:
- The describe() method would return incorrect information after an exception
- The deconstruct() method would return swapped values
- Retry logic would operate on swapped names
- Any code inspecting the operation after the exception would see incorrect state

CONCLUSION:
The bug is 100% reproducible. The operations violate the documented immutability requirement by permanently mutating their state when database_backwards() encounters an exception.
