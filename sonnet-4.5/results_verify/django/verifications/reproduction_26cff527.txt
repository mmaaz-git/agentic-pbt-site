Bug Reproduction Results
========================

Test Environment:
- Django version: Tested with Django installed at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django
- Python version: 3.13
- Function tested: django.core.cache.utils.make_template_fragment_key

Reproduction Test 1 - Manual Test Cases:
----------------------------------------
Test case 1: vary_on=["a:", "b"] vs vary_on=["a", ":b"]
Result: COLLISION CONFIRMED
- Both produce identical key: template.cache.fragment.b76cc21cba4ac805d1fc53024777d235
- Hash portion is identical: b76cc21cba4ac805d1fc53024777d235

Test case 2: vary_on=["x:y", "z"] vs vary_on=["x", "y:z"]
Result: COLLISION CONFIRMED
- Both produce identical key: template.cache.test.9650df9e19633bf061a181a85d966e32
- Hash portion is identical: 9650df9e19633bf061a181a85d966e32

Root Cause Analysis:
-------------------
The implementation concatenates elements with ':' separator without escaping:
- ["a:", "b"] → "a:" + ":" + "b" + ":" = "a::b:"
- ["a", ":b"] → "a" + ":" + ":b" + ":" = "a::b:"

Both produce the exact same byte sequence "a::b:" that gets hashed, resulting in identical cache keys.

Reproduction Test 2 - Hypothesis Test:
--------------------------------------
The hypothesis test from the bug report was run successfully and confirmed the failures.
The test correctly identified that different vary_on lists can produce identical cache keys.

Impact Verification:
-------------------
The bug is real and reproducible. The collision occurs because:
1. The function uses ':' as a separator between elements
2. Elements themselves can contain ':'
3. No escaping or length-prefixing is used
4. This creates ambiguity in the concatenated string

This is a genuine cache key collision bug that violates the fundamental contract that different inputs should produce different cache keys.
