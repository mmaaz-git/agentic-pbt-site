## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The function `_quote_params_for_last_executed_query` has minimal inline documentation:
- Docstring: "Only for last_executed_query! Don't use this to execute SQL queries!"
- This warns against using the function for actual SQL execution, but doesn't specify behavior for edge cases

### Naming Convention
- The underscore prefix (`_quote_params_for_last_executed_query`) indicates this is a private/internal method in Python convention
- Private methods are not part of Django's public API and are not documented in public documentation

### Public Documentation Search Results
1. **Django Official Documentation**: No mention of this function in public API docs
2. **Web Search Results**: Only references found were in bug reports and internal implementation discussions
3. **SQLite3 Python Docs**: No direct reference to this Django-specific implementation

### Related Documentation Context

1. **last_executed_query() Documentation**:
   - This is the public method that uses `_quote_params_for_last_executed_query`
   - The public method already handles empty params case with `if params:` check

2. **Django Database Backend API**:
   - DatabaseOperations is part of Django's database backend interface
   - Private methods within backends are implementation details not covered by stability guarantees

### Documentation Expectations

For a private method (underscore-prefixed):
1. **No public documentation required** - This is an internal implementation detail
2. **No API stability guarantee** - Can change between versions without notice
3. **No edge case handling requirements** - Since it's private, callers are expected to understand preconditions

### Key Finding
The function is clearly marked as private (underscore prefix) and is only meant to be called by `last_executed_query()`, which already protects against the empty params case. The docstring explicitly warns against other uses.

### Conclusion
There is no documentation issue here. The function is private, undocumented by design, and its current caller already handles the empty params edge case appropriately.
