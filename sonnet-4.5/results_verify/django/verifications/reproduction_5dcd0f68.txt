BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

## Source Code Verification
Located the source file at: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/db/backends/mysql/operations.py

Line 65 contains the typo:
```python
raise ValueError(f"Invalid loookup type: {lookup_type!r}")
```

The word "lookup" is misspelled as "loookup" with three 'o's instead of two.

## Reproduction Tests

1. Simple test with invalid lookup type:
   - Input: "invalid$type"
   - Output: ValueError with message "Invalid loookup type: 'INVALID$TYPE'"
   - Confirmed the typo exists in the error message

2. Hypothesis property-based test:
   - Ran 500 test cases with various invalid lookup types
   - All invalid lookup types that trigger the ValueError show the typo
   - Examples of inputs that triggered the error: '0', 'invalid$type', various special characters
   - Every error message contained "loookup" instead of "lookup"

## Impact
The typo appears in user-facing error messages when an invalid lookup type is provided to the date_extract_sql method. While functionally the code works correctly (raises appropriate ValueError), the error message contains a spelling mistake that affects the professional quality of the error reporting.

## Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. The typo exists exactly as described at line 65 of the file, and it consistently appears in error messages when invalid lookup types are provided to the date_extract_sql method.
