## Documentation Analysis

### 1. BaseEmailBackend Contract

The base class `BaseEmailBackend` at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/mail/backends/base.py` provides clear documentation for the `send_messages` method:

```python
def send_messages(self, email_messages):
    """
    Send one or more EmailMessage objects and return the number of email
    messages sent.
    """
```

This docstring explicitly states that the method should:
1. Accept one or more EmailMessage objects
2. **Return the number of email messages sent**

There is no ambiguity here - the method MUST return a number (integer) representing how many messages were sent.

### 2. SMTP Backend Implementation

The SMTP backend correctly implements this contract. At lines 125-126 of `smtp.py`:

```python
if not email_messages:
    return 0
```

The SMTP backend explicitly returns `0` when no messages are provided, which is the correct number of messages sent (zero).

### 3. Console Backend Implementation

The console backend at lines 30-31 of `console.py`:

```python
if not email_messages:
    return
```

This returns `None` instead of an integer, violating the documented contract.

### 4. Django Public Documentation

The Django documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/email/ confirms that `send_messages()` should return "the number of successfully delivered messages", reinforcing that it must be a numeric value.

### 5. Consistency Across Backends

The email backend system is designed to be pluggable - different backends should be interchangeable. Having one backend return `None` while others return `0` for the same input breaks this interchangeability principle.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly establishes that:
1. `send_messages()` must return an integer count
2. For zero messages sent, the return value should be `0`
3. The console backend's return of `None` violates this documented contract
4. The SMTP backend correctly implements the contract with `return 0`
