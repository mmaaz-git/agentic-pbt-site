## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG Classification

**Arguments for BUG:**
1. The code crashes with an unhelpful AttributeError when TEST is set to a non-dictionary value
2. The documentation clearly states TEST should be a dictionary, but the code doesn't validate this
3. The error message doesn't indicate the actual problem (invalid TEST configuration)
4. The code assumes TEST is a dictionary without checking, leading to a crash
5. Other database configuration keys have proper defaults and handling
6. This is a configuration validation issue that should be handled gracefully

**Arguments against BUG:**
- User provided invalid input according to documentation
- However, frameworks should validate configuration and provide clear errors

### Considering INVALID Classification

**Arguments for INVALID:**
1. The documentation clearly states TEST should be a dictionary
2. User is providing incorrect configuration format
3. The code works correctly when proper configuration is provided

**Arguments against INVALID:**
1. The error message is cryptic and doesn't help users understand what's wrong
2. Configuration validation is a basic expectation in frameworks
3. The failure mode is poor - an AttributeError deep in the code rather than a clear configuration error

### Considering WONTFIX Classification

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
1. Users should follow documentation and provide correct configuration
2. The error only occurs with invalid input

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - configuration errors are common
2. The fix is simple and improves user experience significantly
3. Configuration validation is important for framework usability

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST Classification

**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could be seen as requesting better validation of configuration

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. This is a crash/error handling issue, not a new feature
2. Proper error handling for invalid configuration is a basic expectation
3. The code already attempts to work with TEST, it just fails ungracefully

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification

**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation could be more explicit about what happens with invalid values

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation is already clear that TEST should be a dictionary
2. The problem is the code's error handling, not documentation clarity
3. Adding "don't use strings" to documentation doesn't fix the poor error message

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. While the user provided invalid configuration according to documentation, the framework should:
1. Validate configuration and provide clear error messages
2. Not crash with cryptic AttributeErrors for configuration issues
3. Handle invalid input gracefully

The bug is in the error handling and validation, not in the core functionality. Django should either:
- Validate that TEST is a dictionary and raise a clear ImproperlyConfigured exception
- Convert non-dictionary TEST values to empty dictionaries (as the proposed fix does)

Either approach would be better than the current cryptic AttributeError.
