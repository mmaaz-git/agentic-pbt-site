## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments For:**
- The function violates its core invariant: LPAD should always return a string of exactly `length` characters
- The current behavior is inconsistent with all major SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
- The function name LPAD implies "Left PAD" - padding to achieve a specific length
- When fill_text is non-empty, the function correctly returns a string of the specified length
- The bug causes incorrect behavior that could lead to data integrity issues in applications expecting consistent string lengths

**Arguments Against:**
- Django documentation doesn't explicitly specify behavior for empty fill_text
- This is an edge case that may not commonly occur in practice

### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- This is an edge case (empty fill_text) that may rarely occur in real applications
- Users can work around this by checking for empty fill_text before calling the function
- The function works correctly in all normal use cases with non-empty fill_text

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug violates a fundamental invariant of the function
- It's inconsistent with standard SQL database behaviors
- The fix is simple and straightforward
- Property-based testing revealed this as a legitimate issue

### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly define behavior for empty fill_text
- There's no universal SQL standard for this edge case

**Arguments Against:**
- The function name and purpose clearly indicate it should pad to a specific length
- All major databases handle this case more consistently than Django's implementation
- The current behavior (returning unpadded text) doesn't make logical sense
- The bug is reproducible and violates reasonable expectations

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Handling empty fill_text could be seen as an enhancement rather than a bug fix
- The documentation doesn't promise this behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already exists and should work correctly for all inputs
- Other databases handle this case, so it's expected behavior

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation could be updated to explicitly state that empty fill_text returns unpadded text
- This would align documentation with current behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- The current behavior is incorrect and inconsistent
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
- The code should be fixed, not the documentation

## Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The function fails to maintain its fundamental invariant of returning a string of exactly `length` characters when `fill_text` is empty. This behavior is:
1. Inconsistent with all major SQL databases
2. Violates the reasonable expectation based on the function's name and purpose
3. Could cause data integrity issues in applications
4. Has a simple, straightforward fix

The suggested fix (defaulting to space when fill_text is empty, matching PostgreSQL's behavior) is reasonable and maintains backward compatibility while fixing the invariant violation.
