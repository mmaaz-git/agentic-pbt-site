## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report claims there is a typo in the error message of `django.db.backends.oracle.operations.DatabaseOperations.date_extract_sql` where "Invalid loookup type" (with 3 o's) appears instead of "Invalid lookup type" (with 2 o's).

### Reproduction Steps Performed

1. **Verified the typo in Django source code**:
   - Located the Django source at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/db/backends/oracle/operations.py`
   - Confirmed the typo exists on line 109: `raise ValueError(f"Invalid loookup type: {lookup_type!r}")`
   - The word "loookup" indeed has 3 o's instead of the correct 2 o's

2. **Ran the simplified reproduction code**:
   - Created a simplified version of the `date_extract_sql` method
   - Tested with invalid input "invalid!type" which triggers the error
   - Confirmed the error message contains "Invalid loookup type: 'INVALID!TYPE'"

3. **Executed the Hypothesis property-based tests**:
   - Ran 1000 random test cases as specified in the bug report
   - All tests pass correctly, showing the function behavior is correct
   - The only issue is the typo in the error message text

### Results
- ✓ The typo exists exactly as described in the bug report
- ✓ The error occurs when an invalid lookup_type is provided that doesn't match the regex pattern `[A-Z_]+`
- ✓ The functionality is correct - only the error message text has a typo
- ✓ The bug report's sample code runs successfully and reproduces the issue

### Effect of the Bug
This is a minor cosmetic issue in an error message. When users provide an invalid lookup type to the Oracle backend's date_extract_sql method, they see an error message with a spelling mistake ("loookup" instead of "lookup"). This affects:
- User experience: The typo looks unprofessional
- Documentation/searchability: Users searching for this error message might not find help
- Code quality: Typos in error messages reduce confidence in the codebase

The bug does not affect functionality - the method correctly rejects invalid lookup types as intended.
