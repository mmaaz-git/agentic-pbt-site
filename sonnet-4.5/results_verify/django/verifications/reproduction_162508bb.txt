## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Setup
I created test scripts to verify the bug report's claims about the ZeroDivisionError in ProgressBar.update().

### Test Results

1. **Basic Reproduction Test**:
   - Created a ProgressBar with total_count=0
   - Called pb.update(1)
   - Result: **ZeroDivisionError raised as expected**
   - The exact error: "integer division or modulo by zero"

2. **Multiple Count Values**:
   - Tested with count values of 1, 10, and 100
   - All cases with total_count=0 raised ZeroDivisionError
   - This confirms the bug occurs for any positive count value

3. **Normal Operation Test**:
   - Created ProgressBar with total_count=100
   - Called pb.update(50)
   - Result: Successfully created progress bar output
   - Output string: '\r[.....................................                                      ]'
   - This shows the code works correctly when total_count > 0

4. **Property-Based Test**:
   - Ran the exact Hypothesis test from the bug report
   - The test failed with ZeroDivisionError as claimed
   - This validates the bug reporter's test case

### Code Analysis

Looking at line 59 in ProgressBar.update():
```python
perc = count * 100 // self.total_count
```

This line performs integer division by self.total_count with no prior check. When total_count is 0, this will always raise ZeroDivisionError.

### Serializer Integration

Examining the Serializer.serialize() method:
- Line 93: `object_count=0` is the default parameter value
- Line 105: `progress_bar = self.progress_class(progress_output, object_count)`
- Line 146: `progress_bar.update(count)` is called for each object

This means if someone calls serialize() with progress_output enabled but doesn't specify object_count, and the queryset has at least one object, the code will crash with ZeroDivisionError when update() is called.

### Verification Summary

**The bug is 100% reproducible**. The code crashes exactly as described in the bug report. The mathematical operation on line 59 cannot handle total_count=0, and the serializer's default parameter creates this exact condition. The bug reporter's analysis of the code flow is accurate.
