## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)

**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**

1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The method's documented purpose is to "Return a string of the query last executed by the given cursor, with placeholders replaced with actual values." Using `dict.fromkeys()` prevents this from happening correctly when duplicates exist.

2. **Incorrect Behavior**: When parameters contain duplicates, the method:
   - Fails to replace all placeholders (e.g., `:arg3` remains unreplaced)
   - Substitutes wrong values for some placeholders (e.g., `:arg2` gets 200 instead of 'active')
   - Produces misleading debugging output

3. **Inconsistent with Other Backends**: MySQL and PostgreSQL implementations correctly handle all parameters including duplicates. Oracle's manual substitution should achieve the same result.

4. **Real-World Impact**: Duplicate parameter values are common in SQL queries (e.g., date ranges, status codes, user IDs). This bug makes debugging such queries difficult and confusing.

5. **Simple Fix Available**: Removing `dict.fromkeys()` fixes the issue without any negative side effects.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be considered invalid (weak arguments):**

1. The Oracle cursor.statement documentation doesn't explicitly define how placeholders should be mapped - but Django's own documentation does.

2. Someone might argue this is an "implementation detail" - but it's a user-facing debugging method that produces incorrect output.

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX (unlikely):**

1. Could be argued as an edge case - but duplicate parameters are actually common in real queries.

2. The method is primarily for debugging, not production use - but incorrect debugging information is still a bug.

3. Has existed for a long time without complaints - but this doesn't make it correct.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX (very unlikely):**

1. The documentation could be updated to say "duplicate parameters will be deduplicated" - but this would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it.

2. The behavior is undocumented - but the current behavior contradicts the stated purpose of the method.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST (very unlikely):**

1. Supporting duplicate parameters could be seen as a "new feature" - but this is clearly expected behavior based on the method's purpose.

2. The fix could be considered an "enhancement" - but it's fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities.

### Verdict

This is clearly a **BUG**. The method fails to fulfill its documented purpose when parameters contain duplicates. The use of `dict.fromkeys()` is an implementation error that causes:
- Incomplete placeholder substitution
- Wrong values in substituted placeholders
- Misleading debugging information

The bug has a clear reproduction case, affects real-world usage, and has a simple fix. It should be categorized as BUG and fixed by removing the `dict.fromkeys()` call.
