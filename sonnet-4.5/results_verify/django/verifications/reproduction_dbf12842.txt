## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is that Django's `WSGIRequestHandler.get_environ()` method modifies a dictionary (`self.headers`) while iterating over it, which violates Python's dictionary iteration rules.

### Test Results

1. **Direct Dictionary Test**:
   - When testing the exact code pattern from Django's source (`for k in headers: if "_" in k: del headers[k]`), I confirmed that Python raises `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`
   - This occurs with regular Python dictionaries containing headers with underscores

2. **Incomplete Removal**:
   - When the RuntimeError occurs, the iteration is interrupted
   - This results in only partial removal of headers with underscores
   - For example, with headers ['X_Header', 'Y_Header', 'Z_Header'], only 'X_Header' gets removed before the error, leaving ['Y_Header', 'Z_Header'] intact

3. **Security Impact**:
   - The code comment explicitly states the purpose: "Strip all headers with underscores in the name before constructing the WSGI environ. This prevents header-spoofing based on ambiguity"
   - Due to the bug, some headers with underscores may remain, defeating the security measure
   - This creates the exact vulnerability the code is trying to prevent

### Verified Code Location

The bug is in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/servers/basehttp.py` lines 220-222:
```python
for k in self.headers:
    if "_" in k:
        del self.headers[k]
```

The bug report is accurate in its description and the proposed fix (collecting keys first, then deleting) is the standard solution for this Python issue.
