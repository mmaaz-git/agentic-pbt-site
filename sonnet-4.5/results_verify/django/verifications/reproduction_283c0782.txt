BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
======================

1. BUG CONFIRMATION
-------------------
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug occurs in Django version 5.2.6 in the function `django.core.serializers.base.deserialize_m2m_values` at line 360.

2. BUG DESCRIPTION
------------------
When an exception is raised during iteration of field values in `deserialize_m2m_values`, specifically when the iterator's `__next__()` method raises an exception before any value is assigned to the loop variable `pk`, the exception handler attempts to reference the undefined variable `pk`, resulting in an UnboundLocalError.

3. REPRODUCTION STEPS
---------------------
Created test cases that demonstrate the bug:

a) Direct reproduction test (test_bug.py):
   - Created an ErrorIterator class that raises RuntimeError on first __next__() call
   - Created mock classes to simulate Django model infrastructure
   - Called deserialize_m2m_values with the ErrorIterator
   - Result: UnboundLocalError raised with message "cannot access local variable 'pk' where it is not associated with a value"

b) Property-based test (test_hypothesis.py):
   - Tested with multiple exception types: RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError, KeyError
   - All exception types trigger the same UnboundLocalError
   - Confirmed the bug is consistent across different error conditions

4. EXPECTED VS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
-------------------------------
EXPECTED: When an error occurs during iteration, the function should raise M2MDeserializationError with:
- The original exception as `original_exc`
- The problematic value (either `pk` if available, or `field_value`) as context

ACTUAL: The function raises UnboundLocalError because it tries to access `pk` which hasn't been defined yet.

5. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
----------------------
The bug is in the exception handler at line 360:

```python
try:
    values = []
    for pk in pks_iter:  # pk is assigned here during iteration
        values.append(m2m_convert(pk))
    return values
except Exception as e:
    if isinstance(e, ObjectDoesNotExist) and handle_forward_references:
        return DEFER_FIELD
    else:
        raise M2MDeserializationError(e, pk)  # BUG: pk may not be defined!
```

If the iterator raises an exception on the first __next__() call (before pk is assigned), the variable `pk` doesn't exist in the local scope, causing UnboundLocalError.

6. IMPACT
---------
This bug masks the original exception with a confusing UnboundLocalError, making debugging difficult for users. When deserializing fixtures or data with problematic many-to-many relationships, users see:
- UnboundLocalError instead of the meaningful M2MDeserializationError
- No context about what value caused the problem
- The original exception is completely hidden

7. VERIFICATION
---------------
The bug has been verified to:
- Occur consistently with any exception raised by the iterator
- Affect Django 5.2.6 (current version tested)
- Prevent proper error reporting in deserialization scenarios
