## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully reproduced the reported bug using both the provided test case and the Hypothesis property-based test.

### Manual Test Results
The manual test confirmed the bug:
- Initial state: key in _expire_info=True, key in _cache=False
- After calling _delete(): key remains in _expire_info=True
- The method returned False (indicating key not found)
- The key was NOT removed from _expire_info despite not being in _cache

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test failed immediately with the error:
"Test failed: Key :1:0 should not be in _expire_info"

This confirms that for ANY key, when _expire_info contains a key that's not in _cache, calling _delete() fails to clean up _expire_info.

### Code Analysis
The bug is in the _delete() method implementation (lines 102-108):
```python
def _delete(self, key):
    try:
        del self._cache[key]       # Raises KeyError if key not in _cache
        del self._expire_info[key]  # Never reached if above line raises
    except KeyError:
        return False
    return True
```

When `del self._cache[key]` raises KeyError (because the key doesn't exist), the exception is caught immediately, preventing `del self._expire_info[key]` from executing.

### Normal Operation Testing
I verified that in normal cache operations:
1. The public API always maintains synchronization between _cache and _expire_info
2. All public methods use locks to ensure thread safety
3. Methods that call _delete() always check _has_expired() first
4. The scenario (key in _expire_info but not in _cache) cannot occur through normal public API usage

### Technical Impact
The bug is technically real - the _delete() method does fail to clean up _expire_info when called with a key that exists only in _expire_info. However:
1. This is an internal method (prefixed with underscore)
2. The scenario cannot occur through normal public API usage
3. The bug requires direct manipulation of internal data structures to trigger
4. All public methods maintain consistency correctly

### Reproduction Verdict
The bug report is technically accurate - the code behaves exactly as described. The _delete() method does fail to maintain consistency when the dictionaries are already out of sync. However, this situation can only arise through direct manipulation of internal attributes, not through normal use of the cache.
