## Documentation Analysis for parse_cookie

### Function Documentation:
The parse_cookie function in django/http/cookie.py has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Return a dictionary parsed from a `Cookie:` header string."
- No explicit documentation about handling of edge cases or invalid cookie names

### Code Comments:
Line 16-17 contains a comment referencing Mozilla Bugzilla issue #169091 for handling cookies without '=' characters, treating them as having an empty name.

### RFC 6265 Compliance:
According to RFC 6265 (HTTP State Management Mechanism):
1. Cookie names should be tokens that exclude whitespace characters
2. Cookie names cannot contain: whitespace, comma, semicolon, or equals sign
3. The specification explicitly prohibits whitespace (spaces, tabs) in cookie names
4. Whitespace-only cookie names are invalid per the specification

### Django's Implementation:
The current implementation:
1. Strips leading/trailing whitespace from both keys and values (line 19)
2. Accepts cookies with empty keys after stripping (line 20: "if key or val")
3. Does not validate cookie names against RFC 6265 requirements
4. Silently accepts invalid cookie names

### Expected vs. Actual Behavior:
- **Expected (per RFC)**: Invalid cookie names (whitespace-only) should be rejected or handled explicitly
- **Actual**: Invalid cookies are processed, stripped to empty string, causing key collision and data loss
- **Documentation Gap**: No documentation specifies how Django handles invalid cookie names

### Usage Context:
The function is used in Django's WSGI handler to parse HTTP_COOKIE headers into the request.COOKIES dictionary. This is core functionality affecting all Django applications that process cookies.

### Conclusion:
The documentation does not specify behavior for invalid cookie names. The implementation violates RFC 6265 by accepting whitespace-only cookie names, and the silent data loss behavior is undocumented. This represents both a documentation gap and a deviation from the expected RFC-compliant behavior.
