## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report is CONFIRMED. The `GetLanguageInfoListNode.get_language_info()` method in Django's `django.templatetags.i18n` module uses a fragile heuristic to distinguish between string language codes and sequence inputs, which fails for sequences with single-character first elements.

### Steps Taken to Reproduce

1. **Examined Source Code**: Located the actual Django source at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/templatetags/i18n.py`, lines 40-46. The code exactly matches what the bug report describes.

2. **Ran Hypothesis Property-Based Test**: The test immediately found multiple failing examples, including the specific case mentioned in the bug report: `['x', 'Unknown Language']`. The test confirmed that ANY sequence with a single-character first element triggers the bug.

3. **Ran Manual Reproduction Code**: Confirmed the exact behavior described in the bug report:
   - For sequence `['x', 'Unknown Language']`: `language[0]` is `'x'` with `len(language[0]) = 1`, causing it to take the ELSE branch and call `str(['x', 'Unknown Language'])`, resulting in the string `"['x', 'Unknown Language']"` being passed to `translation.get_language_info()`, which then raises a KeyError.

   - For sequence `['en', 'English']`: `language[0]` is `'en'` with `len(language[0]) = 2`, causing it to take the IF branch and correctly call `translation.get_language_info('en')`.

   - For string `'en'`: `language[0]` is `'e'` with `len(language[0]) = 1`, causing it to take the ELSE branch and call `str('en')` which is `'en'`, working correctly by coincidence.

### The Bug

The code at lines 43-46:
```python
if len(language[0]) > 1:
    return translation.get_language_info(language[0])
else:
    return translation.get_language_info(str(language))
```

This logic is fundamentally flawed because:
1. It assumes all sequences will have first elements with length > 1
2. It relies on string indexing behavior (`'en'[0]` = `'e'`) coincidentally working
3. It doesn't actually check the type of the input, just the length of the first indexed element

### Impact

Any sequence (list, tuple, etc.) passed to `get_language_info()` where the first element is a single character will fail with a KeyError. This includes valid single-character language codes or any data structure that happens to have a single-character string as its first element.

### Verification

The bug is 100% reproducible and the report accurately describes both the problem and its root cause. The suggested fix (using `isinstance(language, str)` to properly check types) would correctly address the issue.
