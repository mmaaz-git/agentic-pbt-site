Documentation Findings for django.utils.html.CountsDict
========================================================

1. Official Django Documentation:
   - CountsDict is NOT documented in the official Django documentation
   - It appears to be an internal utility class within django.utils.html
   - The django.utils.html module itself has limited public documentation, focusing mainly on functions like escape(), conditional_escape(), format_html(), etc.
   - CountsDict is not listed as a public API component

2. Source Code Analysis:
   - CountsDict is defined as a subclass of Python's built-in dict class
   - The class has no docstring explaining its purpose or usage
   - The class signature is: class CountsDict(dict)
   - The __init__ method signature is: def __init__(self, *args, word, **kwargs)
   - It has a custom __missing__ method that counts occurrences of a key in the stored 'word'

3. Actual Usage in Django:
   - CountsDict is used exactly once in Django's codebase, on line 420 of django/utils/html.py
   - It's used as: counts = CountsDict(word=middle)
   - The usage is within the Urlizer.trim_punctuation() method
   - It's used to track counts of opening and closing punctuation characters
   - In actual use, NO additional kwargs are ever passed - only the 'word' parameter is used

4. Python dict Contract:
   - Python's built-in dict accepts **kwargs to initialize key-value pairs
   - Example: dict(foo="bar", baz=42) creates {'foo': 'bar', 'baz': 42}
   - Subclasses of dict that accept **kwargs should pass them correctly to super().__init__()

5. Documentation Implications:
   - Since CountsDict is not publicly documented, there's no explicit contract about how it should handle kwargs
   - The signature suggests it should accept **kwargs (like dict does)
   - The internal usage doesn't rely on kwargs functionality
   - This is an undocumented internal utility class, not a public API
