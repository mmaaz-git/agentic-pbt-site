## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The documentation and error messages consistently state that check functions must return a "list", but the code accepts any Iterable (including strings).

2. **Silent Data Corruption**: When a string is returned, the code silently adds individual characters to the errors list instead of raising an error. This is clearly unintended behavior.

3. **Type Safety Violation**: The errors list is expected to contain CheckMessage objects, but ends up containing string characters.

4. **Django's Own Usage**: All of Django's built-in check functions return lists, never strings. This shows the intended API contract.

5. **Misleading Error Message**: The error message says "must return a list" but the validation checks for Iterable, creating confusion.

6. **Real-World Impact**: This bug can cause confusing behavior when developers accidentally return a string from a check function (e.g., due to a typo or logic error).

**Why this IS a bug:**
- The behavior directly contradicts the documented contract
- It causes silent data corruption instead of failing fast
- The current behavior (iterating over string characters) serves no useful purpose
- It's a clear oversight in the validation logic

### Consideration for INVALID

**Potential Arguments (all weak):**
1. The code technically works if you return an iterable - but this contradicts the documentation
2. Strings are iterables in Python - but the context makes it clear this is unintended

**Why this is NOT invalid:**
- The documentation is crystal clear about requiring a "list"
- The error message explicitly says "must return a list"
- The behavior of adding individual characters is nonsensical

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Potential Arguments:**
1. This might be considered an edge case that rarely happens in practice
2. Developers should know not to return strings from check functions

**Why this should NOT be WONTFIX:**
- This is a clear violation of the documented API contract
- It causes silent, confusing failures rather than clear errors
- The fix is trivial (add a string check)
- It affects the reliability of Django's check framework

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Potential Arguments:**
1. Could argue that better validation is a new feature

**Why this is NOT a feature request:**
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The documentation already specifies the behavior; the code just doesn't implement it correctly

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Potential Arguments:**
1. Could update the documentation to say "iterable" instead of "list"
2. Could clarify that strings shouldn't be returned

**Why this is NOT just a documentation fix:**
- The current behavior (adding individual characters) is clearly a bug, not intended functionality
- All Django's own code returns lists, showing the intended design
- Changing docs to match the buggy behavior would be wrong
- The fix should be in the code, not the documentation

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code fails to properly validate the return value of check functions, leading to silent data corruption when strings are returned. The behavior directly contradicts both the documentation and the error message. The fact that strings get split into individual characters and added to the errors list is nonsensical and serves no useful purpose - it's an unintended consequence of insufficient validation.
