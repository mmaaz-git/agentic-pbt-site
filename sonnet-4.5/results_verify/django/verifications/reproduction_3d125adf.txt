REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - The Hypothesis test failed as expected with the error message: "Ensure that there are no more than 0 decimal places."
   - The test correctly identifies that DecimalValidator(max_digits=1, decimal_places=0) fails on Decimal("0.0")

2. MANUAL TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - Decimal("0") passes validation ✓
   - Decimal("0.0") fails validation with error: "Ensure that there are no more than 0 decimal places." ✗
   - Decimal("0.00") fails validation with error: "Ensure that there are no more than 1 digit in total." ✗

3. VALUE EQUALITY VERIFICATION:
   - Confirmed that Decimal("0") == Decimal("0.0") == Decimal("0.00") returns True
   - All three representations are mathematically equivalent to zero

4. INTERNAL REPRESENTATION ANALYSIS:
   Decimal internal representations show the issue:
   - Decimal("0"): digit_tuple=(0,), exponent=0
   - Decimal("0.0"): digit_tuple=(0,), exponent=-1
   - Decimal("0.00"): digit_tuple=(0,), exponent=-2

   The validator's logic in lines 544-560 of validators.py:
   - When exponent < 0 (negative), it calculates decimals = abs(exponent)
   - For Decimal("0.0"), this results in decimals=1
   - For Decimal("0.00"), this results in decimals=2
   - This causes validation failure when decimal_places=0

5. ROOT CAUSE:
   The bug occurs because DecimalValidator counts decimal places based on the Decimal's internal exponent representation rather than treating zero as a special case. Since zero has no significant decimal places regardless of how it's written, the validator should accept any zero representation when validating decimal places.

The bug report accurately describes the issue and the reproduction steps work exactly as stated.
