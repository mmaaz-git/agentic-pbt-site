Documentation Analysis
======================

Django Documentation Review:
---------------------------

1. **Official Documentation for ModelFormMixin.success_url**:
   - The Django documentation states that `success_url` can contain "dictionary string formatting interpolated against the object's field attributes"
   - Example given: `success_url="/polls/{slug}/"` would use the object's slug field
   - Documentation explicitly mentions this formatting capability as a feature

2. **What the Documentation Says**:
   - The success_url attribute supports Python format strings
   - Format placeholders are interpolated with the object's field attributes
   - No mention of error handling when placeholders don't match
   - No warning about what happens if placeholders are invalid

3. **What the Documentation Doesn't Say**:
   - No specification of what happens when a placeholder doesn't exist
   - No mention that KeyError will be raised
   - No guidance on handling missing attributes
   - No warning about the need to ensure all placeholders exist

4. **Method Documentation**:
   - The `get_success_url()` docstring is minimal: "Return the URL to redirect to after processing a valid form."
   - No mention of the formatting behavior or potential errors

5. **Error Handling Pattern in Django**:
   - The same method already uses `ImproperlyConfigured` for missing URL configuration
   - Django consistently uses `ImproperlyConfigured` for configuration-related errors
   - The current KeyError is inconsistent with this pattern

Conclusion:
----------
The documentation explicitly advertises the format string feature but:
- Does not specify the error behavior for missing placeholders
- Does not warn developers about potential KeyErrors
- Creates an expectation that this is a supported, safe feature

This is a case where the documented feature works but fails ungracefully with an unhelpful error message when misconfigured. The error handling should be improved to match Django's established patterns.
