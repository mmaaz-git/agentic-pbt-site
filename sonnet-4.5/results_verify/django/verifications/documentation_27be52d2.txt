## Documentation Review for DeletionMixin.get_success_url

### Official Django Documentation
Based on my search of the Django documentation, I found that:

1. The Django documentation mentions that `success_url` "may contain dictionary string formatting, which will be interpolated against the object's field attributes."

2. This feature is documented as allowing flexible, dynamic routing after delete operations by leveraging the specific object's attributes.

3. The documentation does NOT specify what should happen when:
   - A placeholder in the success_url doesn't match any object attribute
   - There is a typo in the placeholder name
   - The object is missing expected attributes

### Source Code Analysis
Looking at the actual Django source code (django/views/generic/edit.py):

1. Line 236 of DeletionMixin.get_success_url() performs:
   `return self.success_url.format(**self.object.__dict__)`

2. The same pattern appears in ModelFormMixin.get_success_url() at line 120:
   `url = self.success_url.format(**self.object.__dict__)`

3. Both implementations use Python's string.format() method with the object's __dict__ directly, without any error handling for missing keys.

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not explicitly state:
1. That a KeyError will be raised if placeholders don't match object attributes
2. That developers must ensure all placeholders in success_url match actual object attributes
3. What the expected error behavior should be for mismatched placeholders

### Comparison with Other Django Patterns
Other parts of Django that handle similar template/placeholder scenarios often:
- Provide more descriptive error messages (e.g., template variable resolution)
- Use silent failure or default values (e.g., template variables that don't exist render as empty strings)
- Raise ImproperlyConfigured with helpful context about what went wrong

The current implementation provides no context about which placeholder failed to match or what attributes are available, making debugging difficult for developers.
