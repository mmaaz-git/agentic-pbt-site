## Documentation Analysis

### LimitedStream Documentation

1. **Inline Documentation**:
   - The LimitedStream class includes a docstring: "Wrap another stream to disallow reading it past a number of bytes."
   - It references being based on werkzeug.wsgi.LimitedStream implementation
   - The purpose is clear: limit reading to a specified number of bytes

2. **Official Django Documentation**:
   - LimitedStream is not publicly documented in Django's main documentation
   - It's an internal implementation detail of the WSGI handler
   - No explicit documentation about handling negative limits

### HTTP Specification (RFC 7230)

RFC 7230 Section 3.3.2 explicitly states:
- "Any Content-Length field value greater than or equal to zero is valid"
- Negative Content-Length values are NOT valid per HTTP specification
- Recipients should handle invalid Content-Length values appropriately

### WSGIRequest Implementation

The WSGIRequest code shows:
```python
try:
    content_length = int(environ.get("CONTENT_LENGTH"))
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    content_length = 0
```

This attempts to parse Content-Length as an integer, but doesn't validate if it's negative.

### Key Findings

1. **Specification Compliance**: Negative Content-Length values violate RFC 7230. The HTTP specification only allows values >= 0.

2. **Undocumented Behavior**: The LimitedStream class doesn't document what should happen with negative limits. The current behavior (returning empty bytes) is not explicitly specified.

3. **Security Consideration**: While the current implementation accidentally handles negative limits safely (by returning empty bytes), this is not by design but rather a mathematical coincidence (0 >= negative is True).

4. **Best Practice**: The code should explicitly reject or normalize negative Content-Length values to comply with HTTP specifications and make the intent clear.
