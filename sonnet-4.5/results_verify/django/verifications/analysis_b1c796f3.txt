## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Why this should be classified as BUG:**

1. **Clear inconsistency**: The `references_field()` method uses case-sensitive comparison while every other similar method in the same class and module uses case-insensitive comparison.

2. **Breaks expected behavior**: The inconsistency can cause migration optimization to fail when field names differ only in case, violating the principle of least surprise.

3. **Internal API contract violation**: The class maintains `name_lower` as a cached property specifically for case-insensitive comparisons, which is used everywhere except this one method.

4. **Subclass already fixes it**: `RenameField`, which extends `FieldOperation`, overrides `references_field()` to use case-insensitive comparison, suggesting the parent class behavior is wrong.

5. **Real-world impact**: This can cause actual problems in migration optimization when dealing with databases or legacy code where field name casing might vary.

### Why NOT INVALID:

- The bug is reproducible and demonstrates a real inconsistency
- The code clearly violates the pattern established by every other method in the class
- The test case is valid and demonstrates a genuine problem

### Why NOT WONTFIX:

- This is not an obscure edge case - field name comparisons are fundamental to migration operations
- The fix is trivial (one line change) with no backward compatibility concerns
- The inconsistency can cause real problems in migration optimization

### Why NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:

- The code behavior is inconsistent with established patterns in the same module
- Documentation wouldn't fix the underlying inconsistency problem
- The correct behavior is clear from the context of all other similar methods

### Why NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:

- This is not asking for new functionality
- The expected behavior already exists in every other similar method
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding something new

### Conclusion:

This is a valid **BUG** report. The `FieldOperation.references_field()` method has a clear implementation inconsistency that violates the established pattern used throughout Django's migration operations. The case-sensitive comparison on line 49 should be changed to case-insensitive to match the behavior of:
- `is_same_field_operation()`
- `references_model()`
- `RenameField.references_field()`
- All other field/model name comparisons in the migration framework

The proposed fix is correct and should be applied to maintain consistency across the Django migration system.
