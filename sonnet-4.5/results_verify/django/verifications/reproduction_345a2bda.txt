## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in django.utils.http.is_same_domain function.

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: FAILED
   - The property test immediately fails with the simple input 'a'/'A'
   - Shows asymmetric behavior: is_same_domain('a', 'A') = True, but is_same_domain('A', 'a') = False

2. **Specific Bug Report Examples**: All reproduced exactly as reported
   - is_same_domain('A', 'A') = False (should be True)
   - is_same_domain('example.COM', 'EXAMPLE.com') = False (should be True)
   - is_same_domain('Example.Com', 'example.com') = False (should be True)

3. **Additional Testing Reveals Pattern**:
   - When host is lowercase and pattern is uppercase: Works correctly (returns True)
   - When host is uppercase and pattern is lowercase: FAILS (returns False)
   - This confirms the bug is that only the pattern is lowercased, not the host

4. **Subdomain Matching Also Affected**:
   - is_same_domain('foo.example.com', '.EXAMPLE.COM') = True (works)
   - is_same_domain('FOO.EXAMPLE.COM', '.example.com') = False (fails)

### Root Cause:
The function only calls .lower() on the pattern (line 235) but not on the host parameter. This creates asymmetric behavior where the comparison fails when the host contains uppercase letters but the pattern is lowercase.

The bug is real and affects the core functionality of domain matching in Django's HTTP utilities.
