BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

1. **Test Cases Provided:**
   The bug report provides test cases with malformed URLs: "://", "://example.com", "http://", "https://"

2. **Reproduction Results:**
   I successfully reproduced the bug with the following results:

   Origin: '://'
   - Passes check: True (ERROR - should fail)
   - scheme: '' (empty)
   - netloc: '' (empty)
   - Middleware would use empty values

   Origin: '://example.com'
   - Passes check: True (ERROR - should fail)
   - scheme: '' (empty)
   - netloc: '' (empty, not 'example.com' as one might expect)
   - Middleware would use empty values

   Origin: 'http://'
   - Passes check: True (ERROR - should fail)
   - scheme: 'http' (valid)
   - netloc: '' (empty)
   - Middleware would use empty netloc

   Origin: 'https://'
   - Passes check: True (ERROR - should fail)
   - scheme: 'https' (valid)
   - netloc: '' (empty)
   - Middleware would use empty netloc

3. **Property-Based Test:**
   The Hypothesis test failed immediately with the simplest case '://', confirming that origins without valid scheme and netloc can pass the check.

4. **Impact Analysis:**
   When these malformed URLs pass the check:
   - Empty strings end up in csrf_trusted_origins_hosts list
   - Empty scheme keys may appear in allowed_origin_subdomains mapping
   - The CSRF protection silently fails to work as intended
   - Users may think their configuration is correct when it's actually broken

5. **Root Cause:**
   The check function uses a simple substring search for "://" rather than properly parsing the URL with urlsplit() and verifying that both scheme and netloc are present and valid.

VERIFICATION: The bug is 100% reproducible and the technical details in the bug report are accurate.
