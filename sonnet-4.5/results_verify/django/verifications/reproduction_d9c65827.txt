## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported against Django's LocMemCache. Here are my findings:

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction**:
   - Ran the provided test with `max_entries=1` and `num_additional=1`
   - Result: The test FAILED with "Cache size 2 exceeds max_entries 1"
   - This confirms the cache grew to 2 entries when max_entries was set to 1

2. **Manual Reproduction**:
   - Created a cache with `MAX_ENTRIES=1` and `CULL_FREQUENCY=3`
   - Added first key: cache size = 1 (at capacity)
   - Added second key: cache size = 2 (VIOLATES max_entries constraint)
   - The assertion correctly failed: "BUG: Cache has 2 entries, exceeding max_entries=1"

### Code Analysis

Examining the source code in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/cache/backends/locmem.py`:

1. The `_set` method (lines 45-50) checks if the cache is at capacity:
   ```python
   if len(self._cache) >= self._max_entries:
       self._cull()
   ```

2. The `_cull` method (lines 92-100) calculates items to remove:
   ```python
   count = len(self._cache) // self._cull_frequency
   ```

3. **The Bug**: When `cull_frequency=3` and `len(cache)=1`:
   - `count = 1 // 3 = 0`
   - Zero items are removed from the cache
   - The new item is then added, causing the cache to exceed max_entries

### Effect

The bug causes the cache to violate its MAX_ENTRIES invariant when `cull_frequency > max_entries`. This means:
- The cache can grow beyond its configured maximum size
- Memory usage is not properly bounded as expected
- The behavior contradicts what users would expect from setting MAX_ENTRIES

The bug is real, reproducible, and affects the core functionality of cache size management.
