BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in django.core.files.utils.FileProxyMixin.writable(). The bug is confirmed and affects the fallback logic when a file object doesn't have its own writable() method.

## Reproduction Results

### Test 1: Direct Bug Reproduction
When testing file objects that lack a writable() method (forcing the fallback to mode string checking), the following modes FAIL:
- 'r+': Returns False, should return True (read/write mode)
- 'a': Returns False, should return True (append mode)
- 'a+': Returns False, should return True (append/read mode)
- 'x': Returns False, should return True (exclusive creation mode)
- 'x+': Returns False, should return True (exclusive creation/read mode)

Only 'w' and 'w+' modes work correctly because the buggy code only checks if 'w' is in the mode string.

### Test 2: Python File Object Verification
I verified that Python's built-in file objects with these modes are indeed writable:
- open(path, 'r+'): writable() returns True
- open(path, 'a'): writable() returns True
- open(path, 'a+'): writable() returns True
- open(path, 'x'): writable() returns True
- open(path, 'x+'): writable() returns True

### Test 3: Root Cause Confirmation
The bug is located in django/core/files/utils.py, line 67:
```python
return "w" in getattr(self.file, "mode", "")
```

This line only checks for the presence of 'w' in the mode string, which is incorrect. According to Python's file mode specifications, a file is writable if ANY of the following are true:
- 'w' in mode (write mode)
- 'a' in mode (append mode)
- 'x' in mode (exclusive creation mode)
- '+' in mode (update/read-write mode)

### Impact
This bug affects any code that:
1. Wraps a file object with Django's File class
2. Where the wrapped file object lacks a writable() method
3. Where the file was opened with modes 'r+', 'a', 'a+', 'x', or 'x+'
4. And relies on writable() to determine if writing is allowed

The bug causes writable() to incorrectly return False for these writable modes, potentially preventing legitimate write operations.

## Conclusion
The bug is CONFIRMED and matches exactly what was reported. The proposed fix in the bug report is correct - the code should check for any of the characters 'w', 'a', 'x', or '+' in the mode string, not just 'w'.
