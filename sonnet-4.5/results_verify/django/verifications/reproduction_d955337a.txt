BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. CODE ANALYSIS:
   The check_csrf_trusted_origins function implementation (django_4_0.py, lines 7-20):
   - Uses simple string containment check: `if "://" not in origin:`
   - Does NOT validate that "://" appears at the beginning
   - Does NOT validate the scheme is valid
   - Does NOT check if there's a proper netloc after the scheme

2. BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
   The bug report claims the function accepts:
   - "a://a" - CONFIRMED: No errors raised
   - "example.com://http" - CONFIRMED: No errors raised
   - "://example.com" - CONFIRMED: No errors raised

3. REPRODUCTION TEST RESULTS:
   Tested origins and their validation results:
   - "a://a": 0 errors (urlsplit: scheme='a', netloc='a')
   - "example.com://http": 0 errors (urlsplit: scheme='example.com', netloc='http')
   - "://example.com": 0 errors (urlsplit: scheme='', netloc='', path='://example.com')
   - "test://test": 0 errors (urlsplit: scheme='test', netloc='test')
   - "ftp://example.com": 0 errors (urlsplit: scheme='ftp', netloc='example.com')
   - "http://example.com": 0 errors (urlsplit: scheme='http', netloc='example.com')
   - "https://example.com": 0 errors (urlsplit: scheme='https', netloc='example.com')

4. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   The property-based test FAILED with the exact input mentioned in the report:
   - Input: prefix='a', suffix='a' produces origin='a://a'
   - Expected: Should reject invalid scheme
   - Actual: No errors raised
   - Result: AssertionError confirming the bug

5. ERROR MESSAGE ACCURACY:
   The error message states origins "must start with a scheme (usually http:// or https://)"
   But the code only checks if "://" exists anywhere in the string.
   This is a clear mismatch between the error message intent and actual validation.

6. MIDDLEWARE IMPACT:
   When the middleware processes these malformed origins:
   - "a://a" extracts netloc as 'a' with scheme 'a'
   - "example.com://http" extracts netloc as 'http' with scheme 'example.com'
   These would be used for origin matching, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

CONCLUSION: The bug report is technically accurate. The validation function does not properly validate schemes despite its error message claiming it checks that origins "must start with a scheme".
