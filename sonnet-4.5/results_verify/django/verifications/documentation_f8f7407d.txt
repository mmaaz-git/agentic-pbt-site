DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. Official Django Documentation
The Django documentation for to_locale() is minimal:
- States: "Turns a language name (en-us) into a locale name (en_US)"
- Provides only one example: converting "en-us" to "en_US"
- Does NOT specify behavior for inputs without dashes
- Does NOT specify whether uppercase inputs should be normalized

2. Function Docstring
The function's docstring is identical to the online documentation:
"Turn a language name (en-us) into a locale name (en_US)."

3. Standards Context
Based on research into locale and language code standards:
- Language codes (BCP 47/IETF): Use hyphens, like "en-US" or "en-us"
- POSIX locale identifiers: Use underscores, like "en_US"
- The function's purpose is converting from the hyphenated format to the underscore format

4. Implied Behavior from Code Comments
The implementation includes comments about handling various dash-separated formats:
- "A language with > 2 characters after the dash only has its first character after the dash capitalized; e.g. sr-latn becomes sr_Latn"
- "A language with 2 characters after the dash has both characters capitalized; e.g. en-us becomes en_US"

These comments focus on the dash-separated case but don't document the no-dash case.

5. Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not explicitly state:
- What happens with input that has no dash
- Whether uppercase input should be normalized
- What the expected output format is for simple language codes (like "en" or "EN")
- Whether inputs longer than standard language codes are supported

6. Actual Usage Pattern
From examining the Django codebase, to_locale() is used internally in:
- Translation infrastructure (trans_real.py)
- Format localization (formats.py)
These uses suggest it's primarily intended for standard language-country codes.

7. Assessment
The documentation focuses on the primary use case (converting hyphenated language-country codes to POSIX locale format) but leaves the behavior for edge cases unspecified. The function does attempt to handle no-dash inputs by lowercasing them, showing intent to normalize, but the implementation is buggy for strings longer than 3 characters.
