## Documentation Analysis for b62_encode/b62_decode

### Documentation Findings:
1. **No formal documentation exists**: Neither the Django documentation nor the source code contains explicit documentation for b62_encode and b62_decode functions. These appear to be internal utility functions.

2. **No documented behavior for edge cases**: There is no specification about:
   - What should happen with empty string inputs
   - What should happen with invalid base62 strings (e.g., "-" alone)
   - Whether round-trip encoding/decoding is guaranteed for all inputs

3. **Implicit behavior from code**:
   - b62_encode: Takes an integer and returns a base62-encoded string
   - b62_decode: Takes a base62-encoded string and returns an integer
   - Both functions support negative numbers (prefixed with "-")

### Analysis of Bug Report Claims:

1. **Round-trip property**: The bug report assumes that b62_encode and b62_decode should be inverse operations. While this is a reasonable expectation for encoding/decoding functions, it's not explicitly documented.

2. **Error handling**: There's no documented requirement that the function should handle empty strings or validate input. The current implementation simply assumes valid input.

3. **Internal vs. Public API**: These functions appear to be internal utilities used primarily by TimestampSigner. They're not documented in Django's public API documentation.

### Key Observations:
- The functions are used internally by Django's signing framework, particularly TimestampSigner
- The lack of input validation suggests these were written as internal utilities expecting valid input
- The bug affects a real use case (TimestampSigner.unsign with malformed input), but the impact is limited since BadSignature is raised earlier in most cases

### Conclusion:
While the functions lack proper input validation and can crash on edge cases, there's no explicit documentation stating they should handle all possible string inputs. The behavior is unspecified rather than explicitly incorrect.
