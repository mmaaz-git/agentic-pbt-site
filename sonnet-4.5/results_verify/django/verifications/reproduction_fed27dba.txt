REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. Bug Report Code Execution:
   The property-based test provided in the bug report runs successfully and fails as expected:
   - LANG_INFO['az'] returns {'bidi': True, 'code': 'az', 'name': 'Azerbaijani', 'name_local': 'Azərbaycanca'}
   - The assertion `az_info['bidi'] == False` fails
   - Error message correctly states the issue

2. Current State Verification:
   - Azerbaijani (az) is currently marked with bidi=True in Django's LANG_INFO
   - The name_local field shows "Azərbaycanca" which uses Latin characters with diacritics (ə, ç)
   - This spelling is the modern Latin script version, not Arabic script

3. Comparison with Other Languages:
   All other languages marked as bidi=True use scripts that are genuinely RTL:
   - Arabic (ar): العربيّة - Arabic script
   - Algerian Arabic (ar-dz): العربية الجزائرية - Arabic script
   - Central Kurdish (ckb): کوردی - Arabic script
   - Persian (fa): فارسی - Arabic script
   - Hebrew (he): עברית - Hebrew script
   - Uyghur (ug): ئۇيغۇرچە - Arabic script
   - Urdu (ur): اردو - Arabic script

4. Critical Observation:
   Azerbaijani is the ONLY language in the bidi=True list that:
   - Has its name_local written in Latin script ("Azərbaycanca")
   - Uses left-to-right text direction in its modern official form
   - All other RTL languages show their name_local in actual RTL scripts

5. Technical Impact Verification:
   When bidi=True, Django will:
   - Apply RTL text direction in templates using this locale
   - Set dir="rtl" attributes in HTML
   - Potentially mirror UI layouts
   - Apply RTL-specific CSS rules

   This would cause incorrect rendering for Latin-script Azerbaijani text.

6. Bug Report Accuracy:
   The bug report's technical claims are accurate:
   - The test code runs correctly
   - The current value is indeed bidi=True
   - The assertion that it should be False is based on the fact that 'az' uses Latin script
   - The historical context about the 1991 script change is accurate
