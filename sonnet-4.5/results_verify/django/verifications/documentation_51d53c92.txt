## Documentation Review for django.db.backends.dummy

I reviewed Django's documentation and source code to understand the dummy database backend. Here are my findings:

### Official Documentation
1. The Django official documentation (docs.djangoproject.com) does not provide any detailed documentation for the dummy backend. The databases documentation covers PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle, but does not mention the dummy backend.

2. The only documentation found is in the source code itself (django/db/backends/dummy/base.py), which contains a docstring explaining:
   - "Dummy database backend for Django"
   - "Django uses this if the database ENGINE setting is empty (None or empty string)"
   - "Each of these API functions, except connection.close(), raise ImproperlyConfigured"

### Purpose and Design
The dummy backend is a safety mechanism that prevents Django applications from running without proper database configuration. It's not intended for production use or even testing - it's purely a placeholder that raises errors when any database operation is attempted.

### The `operators` Attribute
1. **No documentation exists** about the `operators` attribute in the dummy backend specifically
2. **No documentation exists** about whether `operators` should be instance-specific or class-level
3. Other database backends (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) all define `operators` as class-level dictionaries containing SQL operator mappings
4. The parent class `BaseDatabaseWrapper` does not define an `operators` attribute

### Key Observations
- All other Django database backends define `operators` as a class-level attribute containing operator mappings
- The dummy backend defines `operators = {}` (empty dict) at class level
- There is **no specification** in any documentation about whether `operators` should be mutable between instances
- There is **no specification** about instance isolation for the `operators` attribute
- The dummy backend is designed to fail immediately on use, so the operators dict being empty and shared might be intentional since it should never be used in practice

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not specify:
1. Whether the `operators` attribute should be instance-specific or class-level
2. Whether modifying `operators` on one instance should affect other instances
3. The intended use case for the `operators` attribute in the dummy backend
4. Whether the dummy backend should maintain instance isolation like production backends
