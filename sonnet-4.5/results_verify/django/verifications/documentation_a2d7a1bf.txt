DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR DJANGO Q OBJECTS

I have reviewed the Django documentation and source code for Q objects. Here are my findings:

1. OFFICIAL DJANGO DOCUMENTATION:
The Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects) states that:
- Q objects are used to create complex database queries with logical operations
- They support `&` (AND), `|` (OR), and `^` (XOR) operators
- They can be combined to create arbitrarily complex query conditions
- The documentation describes them as enabling "complex logical combinations of query conditions"

2. DOCSTRING IN SOURCE CODE:
The Q class docstring in django/db/models/query_utils.py states:
"Encapsulate filters as objects that can then be combined logically (using `&` and `|`)."

3. KEY OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE DOCUMENTATION:
- The documentation DOES NOT explicitly state that Q object equality comparison should follow boolean algebra properties
- The documentation DOES NOT mention that Q objects should satisfy commutativity, idempotence, or De Morgan's laws
- The documentation DOES NOT specify how equality comparison (`==`) should work for combined Q objects
- The documentation focuses on how Q objects can be used to build database queries, not on their mathematical properties

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FROM SOURCE:
- Q inherits from tree.Node which has an __eq__ method that compares children in order
- When Q objects are created with keyword arguments, children are sorted (line 54 in Q.__init__)
- When Q objects are combined with & or |, children are added in the order they appear (Q._combine method)
- The identity property used for equality comparison preserves the order of children

5. PURPOSE AND CONTEXT:
Q objects are designed to build SQL queries. Their primary purpose is to generate correct SQL, not to serve as a general-purpose boolean algebra implementation. The equality comparison appears to be structural (comparing the exact tree structure) rather than semantic (comparing logical equivalence).

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not specify that Q objects should behave as a true boolean algebra system with properties like commutativity or idempotence for equality comparisons. The documentation only describes their use for building database queries.
