## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report is accurate. The `_quote_params_for_last_executed_query` method in Django's SQLite3 backend crashes with `sqlite3.OperationalError: incomplete input` when called with an empty parameter tuple or list.

### Reproduction Steps Performed

1. **Simple SQLite3 Test (Direct)**
   - Created test script to reproduce the SQL generation issue
   - Generated SQL: `SELECT ` (with no QUOTE(?) clauses when params is empty)
   - Result: sqlite3.OperationalError: incomplete input (CONFIRMED)

2. **Django Integration Test**
   - Set up minimal Django environment with SQLite3 backend
   - Called `connection.ops._quote_params_for_last_executed_query(())` directly
   - Result: OperationalError: incomplete input (CONFIRMED)
   - Also tested with empty list converted to tuple - same error (CONFIRMED)

### Code Analysis

The function at line 171 in `/django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py`:
```python
sql = "SELECT " + ", ".join(["QUOTE(?)"] * len(params))
```

When `len(params) == 0`:
- `["QUOTE(?)"] * 0` produces an empty list `[]`
- `", ".join([])` produces an empty string `""`
- `sql = "SELECT " + ""` produces `"SELECT "`
- This is invalid SQL syntax that SQLite cannot execute

### Current Usage Context

The function is called by `last_executed_query()` (lines 181-196), which does check `if params:` before calling this method. This means in normal Django usage through the public API, the empty params case is already avoided.

However, the function itself is marked as "private" (underscore prefix) but lacks defensive handling of the empty case.

### Impact Assessment

- The bug exists and reproduces exactly as reported
- The function crashes on empty parameter input
- Currently mitigated by calling code checking for empty params
- Direct calls to this private method will crash with empty params
