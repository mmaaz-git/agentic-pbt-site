## Documentation Analysis

After examining the Django source code and available documentation, here are my findings:

### Field.validate() Documentation

The docstring for Field.validate() states:
"Validate value and raise ValidationError if necessary. Subclasses should override this to provide validation logic."

This is a very generic description that doesn't specify the interaction between choices, blank, and null constraints.

### Key Observations from Source Code

1. **empty_values definition**: `[None, '', [], (), {}]`
   - These are considered "empty" by Django

2. **Validation Order in Field.validate()** (lines 807-827):
   ```python
   # Step 1: Check choices (but ONLY for non-empty values)
   if self.choices is not None and value not in self.empty_values:
       # validate against choices

   # Step 2: Check null constraint
   if value is None and not self.null:
       raise ValidationError

   # Step 3: Check blank constraint
   if not self.blank and value in self.empty_values:
       raise ValidationError
   ```

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not explicitly state:

1. **What should happen when empty values are in choices**: There's no clear documentation about whether an empty string or None in choices should override blank=False or null=False settings.

2. **Precedence rules**: No documentation specifies whether:
   - Choices validation takes precedence over blank/null validation
   - Or blank/null validation takes precedence over choices
   - Or they should be independent constraints

3. **Design intent**: The documentation doesn't clarify if skipping choice validation for empty values is intentional or an oversight.

### Reasonable Expectations

From a developer perspective, there are reasonable arguments for both behaviors:

**Argument for current behavior (not a bug):**
- blank/null are database-level constraints that should always be enforced
- choices is a validation constraint that supplements but doesn't override database constraints
- Empty values need special handling regardless of choices

**Argument for the reported behavior (is a bug):**
- If a developer explicitly includes '' or None in choices, they're saying "this is a valid value"
- The choices constraint is more specific than the general blank/null constraint
- Principle of least surprise: if I say `choices=[('', 'Empty')]`, I expect '' to be valid

### Comparison with Other Frameworks

Many form validation libraries (including Django's own forms) follow the principle that if a value is in the allowed choices, it's valid, regardless of other constraints. This supports the bug report's position.

### Conclusion on Documentation

The documentation is **ambiguous** on this specific interaction. There's no explicit statement about:
- Whether empty values in choices should bypass blank/null validation
- The intended precedence between these constraints
- The rationale for the current implementation

This ambiguity makes it difficult to definitively say whether this is a bug or intended behavior based on documentation alone.
