## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments for:**
1. The behavior contradicts the documented promise that --exclude adds exclusions "in addition to" .git and __pycache__
2. The current implementation creates a counterintuitive situation where adding an exclusion makes filtering LESS restrictive
3. Users cannot achieve a reasonable goal: exclude a custom directory while maintaining default dot-directory filtering
4. The proposed fix is simple and makes the behavior consistent
5. The behavior breaks the principle of least surprise - adding restrictions should not remove existing restrictions

**Strength:** STRONG - This appears to be a legitimate bug where the implementation doesn't match documented behavior and user expectations.

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments for:**
1. The documentation could be interpreted to mean "in addition to .git and __pycache__" as the only guaranteed exclusions, not "all dot directories"
2. The code works as designed, just not as users might expect

**Arguments against:**
1. The help text specifically says exclusions are "in addition to", implying cumulative behavior
2. The current behavior is clearly counterintuitive and surprising
3. No reasonable user would expect that adding --exclude would make MORE directories pass through

**Strength:** WEAK - The arguments for INVALID require tortured interpretations of the documentation.

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
1. This could be considered an obscure edge case that rarely affects users
2. Users can work around it by explicitly excluding directories they don't want

**Arguments against:**
1. This affects common development directories like .vscode, .idea, .DS_Store, etc.
2. The workaround requires users to know about and explicitly exclude every possible dot directory
3. The fix is simple and doesn't break backward compatibility in any meaningful way

**Strength:** WEAK - This is not an obscure edge case but affects common development workflows.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
1. The documentation could be clearer about the default behavior of excluding ALL dot directories
2. The documentation could explicitly state that using --exclude changes the filtering mode

**Arguments against:**
1. The documentation already says exclusions are "in addition to", which implies cumulative behavior
2. The problem is the code behavior, not the documentation - the code should match what the docs say
3. Changing the documentation to match the current behavior would make the feature less useful

**Strength:** WEAK - While documentation could be clearer, the fundamental issue is the code behavior.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
1. Supporting cumulative exclusions while maintaining dot-directory filtering could be seen as a new feature
2. The current code never explicitly promised to maintain dot-directory filtering with --exclude

**Arguments against:**
1. The documentation says "in addition to", which already promises cumulative behavior
2. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
3. Users already expect this to work based on the documentation

**Strength:** WEAK - This is fixing existing functionality to match documentation, not adding new features.

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation contradicts both the explicit documentation ("in addition to") and reasonable user expectations. The current behavior creates a situation where adding restrictions (--exclude) paradoxically removes existing restrictions (dot-directory filtering), which is counterintuitive and problematic for users. The proposed fix is simple, correct, and aligns the implementation with the documented behavior.
