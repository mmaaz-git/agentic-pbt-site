## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug as reported. The issue is confirmed to exist in Django's Q class implementation.

### Property-Based Test Results

The property-based tests fail as expected:
- **Commutativity test**: Failed with message "Expected (AND: ('name', '0'), ('name', 0)) == (AND: ('name', 0), ('name', '0'))"
- **Idempotence test**: Failed with message "Expected (AND: ('name', '0'), ('name', '0')) == (AND: ('name', '0'))"

### Manual Reproduction Results

The manual test case provided in the bug report produces the exact output claimed:

```
q1 & q2 = (AND: ('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 30))
q2 & q1 = (AND: ('age', 30), ('name', 'Alice'))
Equal? False
Same hash? False
Set contains 2 items (expected 1)

--- Idempotence test ---
q = (AND: ('name', 'Alice'))
q & q = (AND: ('name', 'Alice'), ('name', 'Alice'))
Equal? False
```

### Key Findings

1. **Commutativity violation confirmed**: `Q(name='Alice') & Q(age=30)` produces a different result than `Q(age=30) & Q(name='Alice')`, even though these represent the same logical condition.

2. **Idempotence violation confirmed**: `q & q` does not equal `q`, instead creating a duplicate condition.

3. **Hash inconsistency confirmed**: Logically equivalent Q objects have different hash values, which would break their use in sets and as dictionary keys.

4. **Set deduplication failure confirmed**: When adding logically equivalent Q objects to a set, they are treated as distinct items rather than being deduplicated.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from the Q class's `identity` property (line 204-215 in query_utils.py) which constructs a tuple representation of the Q object without normalizing the order of children. This causes structurally different but logically equivalent Q objects to have different identity tuples, leading to inequality and different hash values.

The Q class overrides `__eq__` and `__hash__` (lines 217-223) to use this `identity` property, so the structural differences in how the Q objects are constructed directly impact equality comparisons.
