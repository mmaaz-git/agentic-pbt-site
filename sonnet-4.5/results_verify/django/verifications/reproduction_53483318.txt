Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I successfully reproduced and verified the bug report. Here are the technical details:

## Code Analysis

The bug report correctly identifies unreachable code in django/db/models/functions/datetime.py at lines 357-363:

```python
elif isinstance(value, datetime):
    if value is None:  # Line 358 - UNREACHABLE
        pass
    elif isinstance(self.output_field, DateField):
        value = value.date()
    elif isinstance(self.output_field, TimeField):
        value = value.time()
```

## Reproduction Results

1. **Logical Analysis**: Confirmed that the condition `if value is None:` on line 358 is logically impossible because:
   - The outer condition `isinstance(value, datetime)` must be True to reach this branch
   - If `value` is an instance of `datetime`, it cannot simultaneously be `None`
   - `None` is not an instance of any class, including `datetime`

2. **Runtime Testing**:
   - Ran multiple test cases with various datetime values
   - All tests confirmed that `isinstance(datetime_obj, datetime)` returns True
   - All tests confirmed that `datetime_obj is None` returns False
   - The "if value is None" block is never executed in any test case

3. **Property-Based Testing**:
   - Successfully ran the hypothesis-based property test
   - Generated random datetime values and verified the unreachable code path
   - The test passed, confirming that the None check is never reached

4. **Functional Impact**:
   - The unreachable code does not affect functionality
   - The `pass` statement in the unreachable block does nothing anyway
   - The method works correctly by falling through to the subsequent elif branches
   - This is dead code, not a functional bug

## Technical Correctness

The bug report's technical analysis is accurate:
- The code is indeed unreachable
- The logical explanation is correct
- The proposed fix (removing lines 358-359) would clean up the dead code without affecting behavior

The bug report correctly identifies this as a logic issue with "Low" severity, which is appropriate for dead code that doesn't impact functionality.
