DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. DJANGO NODE CLASS DOCUMENTATION:
The Node class in django.db.migrations.graph has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "A single node in the migration graph. Contains direct links to adjacent nodes in either direction."
- No specific documentation about equality behavior
- No documentation stating whether Nodes should be comparable to tuples
- No documentation about the intended behavior of comparing Nodes to non-Node objects

2. PYTHON EQUALITY CONTRACT DOCUMENTATION:
Python's data model documentation specifies:
- Equality should be reflexive (x == x)
- Equality should be symmetric (if x == y, then y == x)
- Equality should be transitive (if x == y and y == z, then x == z)
- When comparison is not supported, __eq__ should return NotImplemented

3. PYTHON'S COMPARISON PROTOCOL:
Python has a sophisticated comparison protocol that wasn't clearly explained in the bug report:
- When a == b is evaluated, Python calls a.__eq__(b)
- If that returns NotImplemented, Python then tries b.__eq__(a)
- This automatic fallback mechanism ensures symmetry in many cases

4. TOTAL_ORDERING DECORATOR:
The Node class uses @total_ordering decorator which:
- Automatically generates missing comparison methods
- Requires __eq__ and one ordering method (__lt__ in this case)
- Does not change the behavior of __eq__ itself

5. INTENDED BEHAVIOR AMBIGUITY:
The documentation does not specify:
- Whether a Node should be equal to its key tuple
- Whether Nodes should be comparable to non-Node objects
- What the semantic meaning of node == tuple should be

6. SET MEMBERSHIP SEMANTICS:
No documentation found stating whether:
- A tuple key should be found in a set of Nodes
- This behavior is intentional or accidental

7. DJANGO MIGRATION CONTEXT:
Nodes represent migrations in a directed graph where:
- Each Node has a key that is a tuple of (app_label, migration_name)
- Nodes track parent and child relationships
- The implementation suggests nodes might need to be compared with tuple keys for graph operations

8. LACK OF SPECIFICATION:
The most critical finding is that there is NO explicit specification for:
- How Node equality should work
- Whether cross-type comparison (Node to tuple) is supported
- What the contract for Node.__eq__ should be

The current behavior (allowing Node to equal its key tuple) appears to be intentional given the implementation, but this is not documented anywhere.
