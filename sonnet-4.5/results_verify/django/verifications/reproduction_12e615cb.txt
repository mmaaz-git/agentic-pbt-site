## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

I attempted to reproduce the bug described in the report, but the results are completely different from what the report claims:

1. **Hypothesis Test Result**:
   - The property-based test passes without any assertion errors
   - When testing with negative limits (e.g., -1, -398, -380, -1000), LimitedStream.read() returns 0 bytes, not unlimited reading

2. **Specific Failing Input Test**:
   - Input: data=b'X' * 100, limit=-10
   - Expected (per bug report): Should read 100 bytes
   - Actual result: Reads 0 bytes

3. **Manual Reproduction Test**:
   - Input: data=b'A' * 1000, limit=-50
   - Expected output (per bug report): "Limit: -50, Bytes read: 1000"
   - Actual output: "Limit: -50, Bytes read: 0"

### Code Analysis

The actual Django LimitedStream implementation (django/core/handlers/wsgi.py) behaves as follows:

```python
def read(self, size=-1, /):
    _pos = self._pos
    limit = self.limit
    if _pos >= limit:  # Line 32
        return b""
    ...
```

With a negative limit (e.g., -50) and _pos starting at 0:
- The condition `0 >= -50` evaluates to `True`
- The method immediately returns `b""` (empty bytes)
- No unbounded reading occurs

### Conclusion

The bug report is INCORRECT. The current Django implementation actually handles negative limits safely by:
1. Checking if current position >= limit
2. With negative limits, this check is always True (0 >= negative number)
3. Returning empty bytes immediately

The claimed vulnerability where "Python's stream.read(negative_number) reads all remaining data" never happens because the code returns before reaching that point.

The bug report's analysis is flawed - it incorrectly assumes the condition `if _pos >= limit` evaluates to False when limit is negative, but mathematically 0 >= -50 is True, not False.
