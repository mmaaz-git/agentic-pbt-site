# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Bug Report Claims
The report claims that `CheckMessage.__eq__` violates symmetry when comparing parent and child class instances, with one comparison returning True and the other returning False.

## Analysis for Each Category

### INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
1. **Bug Cannot Be Reproduced**: The bug as described does not exist in Django 5.2.6. Both `parent == child` and `child == parent` return `False`, maintaining symmetry.
2. **Incorrect Test Case**: The bug report's test case claims asymmetric behavior that doesn't actually occur.
3. **No Contract Violation**: Python does not mandate symmetric equality (per official documentation).
4. **Working As Designed**: The current behavior where parent and child instances are not equal could be intentional design.

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The concept of symmetric equality is a widely-accepted best practice, even if not strictly required.
- The bug might exist in a different version of Django than what was tested.

### WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
1. **Obscure Edge Case**: Comparing parent CheckMessage instances with subclass instances is likely rare in practice.
2. **Current Behavior is Reasonable**: Having parent and child instances not equal to each other is a valid design choice.
3. **No Practical Impact**: Since both comparisons return False, there's no actual asymmetry to fix.

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- If the bug existed as described, it would violate fundamental expectations about equality.
- The proposed fix is simple and low-risk.

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. **Enhancement Request**: The report could be interpreted as requesting that parent and child instances compare equal when attributes match.
2. **Not Currently Supported**: Making CheckMessage instances equal to their subclass instances is a new feature, not a bug fix.

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The report is framed as a bug, not a feature request.
- The focus is on symmetry, not on adding new comparison capabilities.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. **Undocumented Behavior**: The Django documentation doesn't specify how CheckMessage equality should work.
2. **Could Add Clarification**: Documentation could explicitly state that parent and child instances are not considered equal.

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The bug report doesn't claim the documentation is wrong.
- The issue is about code behavior, not documentation accuracy.

### BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
1. **Symmetry is Expected**: Even though not mandated, symmetric equality is a strong convention in Python.
2. **Proposed Fix is Reasonable**: The suggested fix would ensure consistent behavior.

**Arguments against BUG:**
1. **Cannot Reproduce**: The bug doesn't exist as described - both comparisons return False, maintaining symmetry.
2. **No Actual Asymmetry**: The current implementation is symmetric (False == False).
3. **Test Passes**: The hypothesis test provided in the bug report passes without errors.

## Key Findings
1. **The bug does not exist as described** - testing shows both comparisons return False, maintaining symmetry.
2. **The current implementation is symmetric** - False == False satisfies the symmetry property.
3. **No documentation specifies the expected behavior** for parent/child equality.
4. **The hypothesis test passes** without any assertion errors.

## Recommendation
This bug report should be classified as **INVALID** because:
1. The core claim (asymmetric equality) is factually incorrect
2. The provided test case passes without errors
3. The current behavior maintains symmetry
4. There is no violation of any documented or required behavior

The bug report appears to be based on a misunderstanding or possibly testing against a different version/configuration than what currently exists.
