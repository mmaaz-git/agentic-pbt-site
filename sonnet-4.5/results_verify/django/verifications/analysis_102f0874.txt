## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This could be considered invalid if Django's documentation explicitly stated that COOP values must be provided without any whitespace, or if there was a clear design decision that configuration values should be exact strings. The user might be expected to provide clean configuration values without extraneous whitespace. One could argue that configuration values should be properly formatted by the user, and it's not the framework's responsibility to clean up sloppy input.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report is technically correct - the function does fail to handle whitespace that is semantically meaningless. The HTTP specification (RFC 9110) explicitly states that leading and trailing whitespace in header values can be trimmed without changing semantics. The inconsistency with check_referrer_policy, which does strip whitespace, suggests this is not intentional behavior. The error message is also misleading, claiming the value is "invalid" when "unsafe-none" is perfectly valid.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be classified as WONTFIX if the maintainers consider it a trivial edge case that users can easily work around by ensuring their configuration values don't have whitespace. The current behavior has likely been in place for years without causing significant issues. Users who encounter this error can simply remove the whitespace from their configuration. The fix might be considered not worth the effort or potential risk of changing existing behavior.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue affects real-world usage scenarios where configuration values might naturally acquire whitespace through copy-paste operations, multi-line string concatenation, or text editor behavior. The fix is trivial (adding .strip()) and low-risk. The inconsistency with check_referrer_policy suggests this is an oversight that should be corrected. The misleading error message causes unnecessary debugging time for developers.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the current behavior is intentional, the documentation should explicitly state that COOP values must not contain any leading or trailing whitespace. The documentation currently doesn't mention this requirement, which could be seen as a documentation oversight. Adding a note about exact string matching requirements would help users avoid this issue.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code behavior appears to be unintentional rather than a documentation issue. The related check_referrer_policy function handles whitespace correctly, suggesting the expected behavior is to trim whitespace. Documenting a quirk that should be fixed in code would be addressing the symptom rather than the cause. The HTTP specifications support trimming whitespace, so documenting the opposite would go against standard practices.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that adding whitespace handling is a new feature - enhancing the robustness of configuration parsing. The current code works as originally written (exact string matching), and adding whitespace trimming would be an enhancement to make it more user-friendly. This could be framed as a request to improve configuration value normalization across all security checks.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not requesting new functionality but fixing existing functionality to work correctly according to HTTP standards. The check_referrer_policy function already implements this "feature," making it an inconsistency fix rather than a new capability. The behavior violates the principle of least surprise - users reasonably expect whitespace to be handled gracefully in configuration values.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function fails to handle valid COOP values when they contain semantically meaningless whitespace, violating HTTP header parsing standards (RFC 9110). The inconsistency with check_referrer_policy, which correctly strips whitespace, strongly suggests this is an oversight. The error message misleads users by claiming the value is invalid when only the whitespace is problematic. Common configuration scenarios (copy-paste, multi-line strings) naturally introduce whitespace, making this a practical issue. The fix is trivial and the expected behavior is clear from both HTTP standards and related Django code.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
One could argue the function works as designed - it checks for exact string matches in the valid values set. There's no explicit documentation claiming whitespace should be handled, and the current behavior is deterministic and predictable. Some might consider it the user's responsibility to provide clean configuration values without extraneous characters.

## Overall Consideration

After thorough analysis, this appears to be a legitimate bug that should be fixed. The primary evidence supporting this classification includes the clear inconsistency with the related check_referrer_policy function in the same module, which explicitly handles whitespace by calling .strip() on values. This inconsistency alone strongly suggests that the lack of whitespace handling in check_cross_origin_opener_policy is an oversight rather than intentional design.

The HTTP specification (RFC 9110) explicitly states that leading and trailing whitespace in header field values can be removed without changing semantics. This is a fundamental principle of HTTP header parsing, and Django, as a web framework, should follow these standards. The fact that whitespace is semantically meaningless in this context but causes the validation to fail represents a violation of expected behavior based on web standards.

From a practical perspective, this bug affects real-world usage. Configuration values commonly acquire whitespace through various means: copy-paste operations from documentation or other sources, multi-line string concatenation in Python settings files, text editor auto-formatting, or human error. The current behavior creates an unnecessarily poor developer experience, where a perfectly valid COOP value is rejected with a misleading error message that doesn't indicate the actual problem (whitespace) but instead claims the entire value is invalid. Given that the fix is trivial (adding .strip() to the check), the risk is minimal, and the benefit to users is clear, this should be classified as a BUG rather than relegated to a documentation issue or feature request.
