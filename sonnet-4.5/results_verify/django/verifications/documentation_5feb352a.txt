## Documentation Analysis

### Django Serialization Architecture

Based on the source code analysis, Django has a two-layer architecture for serialization:

1. **Base Python Deserializer** (`django.core.serializers.python.Deserializer`):
   - This is the core deserialization logic that works with Python objects
   - It directly accesses dictionary keys without error handling
   - It will raise KeyError if required keys are missing

2. **Format-Specific Deserializers** (JSON, YAML, JSONL):
   - These inherit from the Python deserializer
   - They parse the format-specific input into Python objects
   - They wrap the Python deserializer's `_handle_object` method with error handling

### Error Handling Documentation

From `django/core/serializers/base.py`:
- `DeserializationError` is defined as: "Something bad happened during deserialization."
- It provides a `WithData` factory method for creating more explanatory error messages
- This is the standard exception for deserialization problems

### Observed Behavior in Different Formats

1. **JSON Deserializer** (`django/core/serializers/json.py`):
   - Overrides `_handle_object` method
   - Catches all exceptions except `GeneratorExit` and `DeserializationError`
   - Re-raises them as `DeserializationError` with message: "Error deserializing object: {original_exception}"

2. **YAML Deserializer** (`django/core/serializers/pyyaml.py`):
   - Follows the same pattern as JSON
   - Wraps exceptions in `DeserializationError`

3. **JSONL Deserializer** (`django/core/serializers/jsonl.py`):
   - Also follows the same pattern
   - Wraps exceptions in `DeserializationError`

### API Contract

The consistent pattern across all format-specific deserializers shows that:

1. **The API contract is that deserialization errors should raise `DeserializationError`**
2. The Python deserializer is an internal implementation detail
3. End users should only interact with format-specific deserializers (JSON, YAML, etc.)
4. These format-specific deserializers are responsible for converting internal exceptions to `DeserializationError`

### Documentation Implications

The bug report's claim that "The API contract states that deserialization errors should raise DeserializationError" is correct. However, the current implementation already fulfills this contract:

- When using `serializers.deserialize('json', ...)`, users get `DeserializationError`
- When using `serializers.deserialize('yaml', ...)`, users get `DeserializationError`
- The Python deserializer raising `KeyError` is an implementation detail that users don't see

The bug reporter appears to be looking at the Python deserializer code in isolation, but missing that it's always wrapped by format-specific deserializers that handle the error conversion.
