BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

1. REPRODUCTION OF REPORTED BUG
-------------------------------
The bug report claims that get_exception_info incorrectly reports 1 line for empty templates instead of 0.

Test Results:
✓ CONFIRMED: Empty source ('') reports total=1 instead of total=0
✓ CONFIRMED: Whitespace-only source ('   \n  \t  ') also reports total=1 after stripping
✓ The Hypothesis test fails exactly as reported with lineno=1, source='', message='test'

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
----------------------
Python's behavior with empty strings:
- ''.split('\n') returns [''] (list with one empty string)
- This is standard Python behavior, not a Django bug per se
- The code at line 105: `lines = list(enumerate(source.strip().split("\n"), start=1))`
  Creates [(1, '')] for empty source

3. ADDITIONAL ISSUE DISCOVERED
------------------------------
CRITICAL BUG: The code crashes with IndexError when lineno > 1 and source is empty:
- Test case: lineno=2, source='', message='test'
- Error: "list index out of range" at line 106: `during = lines[lineno - 1][1]`
- This happens because lines only has 1 element [(1, '')], but we try to access index 1

4. ACTUAL BEHAVIOR VS EXPECTED
-------------------------------
Current behavior:
- Empty template: total=1, source_lines=[(1, '')], during=''
- Single line template: total=1, source_lines=[(1, 'text')], during='text'
- Multi-line template: Works correctly

Bug report's expected behavior:
- Empty template: total=0, source_lines=[], during=''

5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT
-------------------
- The incorrect line count (1 vs 0) is primarily cosmetic for debug output
- However, the IndexError with lineno>1 on empty source is a real crash bug
- Empty templates are rare in practice but could occur during development/debugging
