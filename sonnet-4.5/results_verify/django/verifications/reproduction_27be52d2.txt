## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test 1: Exact Reproduction from Bug Report
The bug report's test case was successfully reproduced:
- Created a DeletionMixin with success_url = '/category/{category_id}/'
- Created a MockObject with only an 'id' attribute (no 'category_id')
- Called get_success_url()
- **Result**: KeyError: 'category_id' was raised as reported

The error message is just the bare key name 'category_id' with no additional context about:
- Which view/mixin raised the error
- What attributes are available on the object
- How to fix the issue

### Test 2: Working Case
When the placeholder matches an object attribute:
- Created a DeletionMixin with success_url = '/object/{id}/'
- Created a MockObject with an 'id' attribute = 42
- Called get_success_url()
- **Result**: Successfully returned '/object/42/'

### Test 3: Consistency Check with ModelFormMixin
ModelFormMixin has the exact same behavior:
- Uses the same pattern: `self.success_url.format(**self.object.__dict__)`
- Raises the same bare KeyError when placeholders don't match
- No additional error handling or helpful messages

### Test 4: Source Code Verification
Confirmed the bug is at line 236 of DeletionMixin.get_success_url():
```python
return self.success_url.format(**self.object.__dict__)
```

### Property-Based Testing
The property-based test from the bug report correctly identifies the issue:
- When any placeholder in success_url doesn't exist in object.__dict__, a KeyError is raised
- This happens consistently across all test cases

### Impact Assessment
1. **The error occurs in real-world scenarios:**
   - Developer typos in placeholder names
   - Refactoring where object attributes are renamed but success_url isn't updated
   - Using a generic view with objects that have different attribute names

2. **The current error is unhelpful:**
   - Bare KeyError with just the missing key name
   - No indication this is a configuration error vs runtime error
   - No guidance on how to fix the issue

3. **Both DeletionMixin and ModelFormMixin are affected**
   - This is a pattern used in multiple places in Django's generic views
   - Any fix should probably be consistent across both
