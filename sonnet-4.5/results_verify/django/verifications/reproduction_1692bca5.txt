## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug occurs when using Django's Signal class with `use_caching=True` and non-weakly-referenceable senders.

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: FAILED with TypeError: "cannot create weak reference to 'str' object"
   - The property-based test correctly identifies the bug when any string is used as a sender

2. **Direct Reproduction**: CONFIRMED
   - With `use_caching=True` and string sender: FAILS with TypeError
   - With `use_caching=False` and string sender: WORKS correctly
   - With `use_caching=True` and class instance sender: WORKS correctly

3. **Additional Testing with Non-Weakly-Referenceable Types**: ALL FAILED
   - Integer (42): TypeError - cannot create weak reference to 'int' object
   - Float (3.14): TypeError - cannot create weak reference to 'float' object
   - None: TypeError - cannot create weak reference to 'NoneType' object
   - Tuple ((1, 2, 3)): TypeError - cannot create weak reference to 'tuple' object
   - Boolean (True): TypeError - cannot create weak reference to 'bool' object

### Bug Mechanism:

The bug occurs in django/dispatch/dispatcher.py at line 183 in the `send()` method:
```python
or self.sender_receivers_cache.get(sender) is NO_RECEIVERS
```

When `use_caching=True`, the Signal's __init__ creates a WeakKeyDictionary:
```python
self.sender_receivers_cache = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary() if use_caching else {}
```

WeakKeyDictionary requires all keys to be weakly referenceable, but Python's built-in immutable types (str, int, float, bool, None, tuple, frozenset) cannot have weak references created to them.

### Impact:

1. The error only manifests during `send()`, not during `connect()`, making it a runtime surprise
2. String senders are commonly used in Django (e.g., for model names, signal names)
3. The same code works fine with `use_caching=False`, creating inconsistent behavior
4. There is no documentation warning about this limitation

The bug report accurately describes the issue and the proposed fix (using a regular dict instead of WeakKeyDictionary) would resolve the problem.
