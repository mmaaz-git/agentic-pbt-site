REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have attempted to reproduce the bug reported in django.db.migrations.graph.Node.__eq__ and found the following:

1. BUG REPORT CLAIM:
The report claims that Node.__eq__ violates Python's equality contract by implementing asymmetric equality comparison where:
- node == key evaluates to True
- key == node evaluates to False

2. REPRODUCTION RESULTS:
When testing with Django 5.2.6 and Python 3.13.2:
- node == key evaluates to True
- key == node ALSO evaluates to True

The symmetry appears to be PRESERVED, not violated as claimed.

3. TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION:
The current Node.__eq__ implementation is:
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    return self.key == other
```

This compares self.key directly with other, regardless of other's type.

4. WHY SYMMETRY APPEARS PRESERVED:
Through detailed tracing, I discovered that Python's comparison protocol automatically handles the symmetry:

- When evaluating "tuple == node", Python first calls tuple.__eq__(node)
- Since tuple doesn't know how to compare with a Node object, it returns NotImplemented
- Python then automatically tries the reverse: node.__eq__(tuple)
- This means Node.__eq__ gets called for BOTH "node == tuple" AND "tuple == node"

5. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
The provided hypothesis test passes without error across 100 random test cases. The test checks:
```python
assert (node == key) == (key == node)
```
This assertion does NOT fail in my testing environment.

6. SET MEMBERSHIP BEHAVIOR:
The report also claims "key in node_set" incorrectly returns True. Testing shows:
- key in {node} returns True
- This is because Python uses the equality operator for membership testing
- Since node == key returns True (by design), the membership test succeeds

7. ACTUAL BEHAVIOR vs CLAIMED BEHAVIOR:
- Claimed: Asymmetric equality (node==key is True, key==node is False)
- Actual: Symmetric equality (both comparisons return True)

The current implementation does allow a Node to compare equal to its key tuple, which may or may not be intended behavior, but it does NOT violate symmetry as claimed in the bug report.
