## Documentation Analysis for BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware.is_ignorable_request

### Official Documentation
The Django documentation for BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware is very sparse. The official documentation only states that it "Sends broken link notification emails to MANAGERS". No specific details are provided about the is_ignorable_request method or its behavior with APPEND_SLASH.

### Source Code Comments
The source code itself provides the most documentation through inline comments:

1. **Method Purpose** (line 153-157):
   - "Return True if the given request *shouldn't* notify the site managers according to project settings or in situations outlined by the inline comments."

2. **APPEND_SLASH Logic** (line 163-164):
   - "APPEND_SLASH is enabled and the referer is equal to the current URL without a trailing slash indicating an internal redirect."

### What the Code is Intended to Do
Based on the comments and code structure, the is_ignorable_request method is designed to identify requests that shouldn't trigger broken link notification emails. Specifically for the APPEND_SLASH case:

- When APPEND_SLASH is True and Django redirects from "/page" to "/page/" (adding a trailing slash)
- The referrer would be the original URL without the slash
- The current URI would be the URL with the slash
- This internal redirect should be ignored (not send email notifications)

### Key Parameters
- `request`: The HTTP request object
- `uri`: The current requested path (e.g., "/page/")
- `domain`: The current domain (e.g., "example.com")
- `referer`: The HTTP Referer header value (full URL like "http://example.com/page")

### HTTP Referer Header Standard
According to HTTP specifications, the Referer header contains a full URL, not just a path. This includes the scheme (http/https), domain, and path.

### Missing Documentation
The documentation does not explicitly state:
- Whether the referer parameter is expected to be a full URL or just a path
- Whether the uri parameter includes just the path or the full URL
- The exact format expected for the comparison in line 165

The lack of explicit documentation about parameter formats leaves the intended behavior somewhat ambiguous, though standard HTTP practice suggests referer should be a full URL.
