## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. Here are the findings:

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: Failed immediately on the case with `key='0', value=0, delta=0`
   - Expected: Value should be preserved at the same version
   - Actual: Value is None (deleted)

2. **Specific Test Case (`delta=0`)**:
   - Set value 0 at version 1
   - Called `incr_version` with delta=0
   - Expected: Value 0 should exist at version 1
   - Actual: Value is None at version 1 (data lost)

3. **Bug Report's Example**:
   - Set value 42 at version 1
   - Called `incr_version` with delta=0
   - Expected: Value 42 at version 1
   - Actual: None (value deleted)

4. **Comparison with Other Delta Values**:
   - `delta=-1`: Works correctly - value moved from version 5 to version 4
   - `delta=0`: **FAILS** - value deleted at version 5
   - `delta=1`: Works correctly - value moved from version 5 to version 6
   - `delta=2`: Works correctly - value moved from version 5 to version 7

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs exactly as described in the report. Looking at the implementation:

```python
def incr_version(self, key, delta=1, version=None):
    # ... setup code ...
    self.set(key, value, version=version + delta)  # Line 358
    self.delete(key, version=version)              # Line 359
    return version + delta
```

When `delta=0`:
1. Line 358: `self.set(key, value, version=5+0)` sets value at version 5
2. Line 359: `self.delete(key, version=5)` deletes value at version 5
3. Result: The value that was just set is immediately deleted

### Impact

This is a real bug that causes data loss when `delta=0` is used. While `delta=0` might seem like an edge case, the method:
- Accepts it as a valid parameter (no validation preventing it)
- Doesn't document that delta=0 is invalid
- Could reasonably be expected to work as a no-op or to keep the value at the same version

### Verification

The bug is 100% reproducible and affects the Django cache backend's versioning system. The issue is in the base implementation and would affect all cache backends that inherit from BaseCache.
