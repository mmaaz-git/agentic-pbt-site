BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

1. TEST EXECUTION RESULTS:
-------------------------
The bug report is TECHNICALLY CORRECT in its claims:
- Two OrderedSet instances with identical elements DO compare as unequal
- OrderedSet([1,2,3]) == OrderedSet([1,2,3]) returns False
- Empty OrderedSets also compare as unequal: OrderedSet() == OrderedSet() returns False
- The property-based test fails immediately on the first example (empty list)

2. OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:
--------------------
Current OrderedSet equality behavior:
- os1 == os1: True (same object)
- os1 == os2: False (different objects with same content)
- Uses default object.__eq__ which compares identity (id)
- Falls back to "is" comparison rather than content comparison
- OrderedSet IS hashable (uses default object.__hash__)

3. COMPARISON WITH PYTHON'S SET:
--------------------------------
Python's built-in set behavior:
- {1,2,3} == {1,2,3}: True (content-based equality)
- set() == set(): True (empty sets are equal)
- Sets compare contents, not identity
- Sets are NOT hashable (mutable)

4. VERIFICATION OF BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
-------------------------------------
✓ The bug report's code runs correctly
✓ The output matches what the report claims
✓ The Hypothesis test does fail as described
✓ OrderedSet lacks __eq__ implementation (confirmed by source inspection)
✓ Two OrderedSets with identical content are unequal

5. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:
----------------------
- OrderedSet DOES preserve insertion order (as expected)
- OrderedSet([1,2,3]) != OrderedSet([3,2,1]) would be expected even with equality
- The class works correctly for all other operations (iteration, membership, etc.)
- The proposed fix in the bug report would make OrderedSet hashable with content-based hash

6. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
---------------------
The bug report is TECHNICALLY ACCURATE:
- The test case is valid
- The reproduction steps work
- The observed behavior matches the claim
- The root cause (missing __eq__) is correctly identified

SUMMARY:
--------
The bug reproduction confirms that OrderedSet does not implement content-based equality. Two OrderedSet instances with identical elements in the same order compare as unequal. This is the default Python object behavior when __eq__ is not implemented.
