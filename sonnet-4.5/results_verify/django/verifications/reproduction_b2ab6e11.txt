## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### Test Execution

1. **Hypothesis Test**: I ran the property-based test provided in the bug report. When tested with `parts=['A', 'A', 'A']` (resulting in string "A.A.A"), the test FAILED as expected. The error message was "too many values to unpack (expected 2)" which indeed does not mention "dot" or explain the requirement.

2. **Manual Reproduction**:
   - Testing with "A.A.A" (multiple dots): Raised ValueError with message "too many values to unpack (expected 2)"
   - Testing with "nodots" (zero dots): Raised ValueError with message "not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)"

### Code Inspection

I examined the actual implementation in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/apps/registry.py`:

- Lines 196-198 contain the docstring that promises: "Raise ValueError if called with a single argument that doesn't contain exactly one dot."
- Line 206 contains the problematic code: `app_label, model_name = app_label.split(".")`

This line uses Python's unpacking without any validation, which causes the generic unpacking error messages instead of a clear, descriptive error about the dot requirement.

### Verification

The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The error messages are indeed confusing and don't help users understand what they did wrong. The implementation violates the documented contract by not providing a clear ValueError message explaining the dot requirement.
