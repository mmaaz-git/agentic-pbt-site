Documentation Analysis for ErrorDict.copy()
===========================================

## Official Documentation Review

### Django Documentation
- No specific documentation found for ErrorDict.copy() method in Django's official documentation
- ErrorDict class is briefly mentioned in forms API but without detailed method specifications
- No explicit documentation about what attributes should be preserved when copying ErrorDict

### Class Docstring
ErrorDict docstring only states:
"A collection of errors that knows how to display itself in various formats.
The dictionary keys are the field names, and the values are the errors."

No mention of copy() behavior or renderer preservation.

### Python dict.copy() Documentation
dict.copy() documentation states: "Return a shallow copy of the dict."
This only copies dictionary key-value pairs, not custom instance attributes.

## Implicit Expectations

### Consistency with ErrorList
ErrorList, which is a sibling class in the same module with similar purpose and structure:
- Has the same renderer attribute pattern
- DOES override copy() to preserve renderer (lines 163-167 in utils.py)
- This establishes a pattern/expectation within the same module

### General Copy Semantics
While not explicitly documented, users reasonably expect:
1. copy() should create a functionally equivalent object
2. Attributes essential to the object's behavior should be preserved
3. The renderer attribute is essential for ErrorDict's rendering functionality

## Documentation Gap
The lack of explicit documentation about ErrorDict.copy() behavior creates ambiguity. However:
1. The inconsistency with ErrorList.copy() suggests this is an oversight, not intentional
2. The renderer is a core attribute set in __init__, suggesting it's essential to the object's identity
3. The proposed fix follows the established pattern in the same module

## Conclusion
While there's no explicit documentation stating ErrorDict.copy() should preserve renderer, the:
- Parallel implementation in ErrorList
- Essential nature of the renderer attribute
- General expectations of copy() semantics
All suggest this is a legitimate bug rather than undefined behavior.
