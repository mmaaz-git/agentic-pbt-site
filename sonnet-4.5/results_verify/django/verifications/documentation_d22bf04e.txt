DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
-----------------------
The `handle_extensions()` function has a docstring that describes its purpose:
- "Organize multiple extensions that are separated with commas or passed by using --extension/-e multiple times"
- It's used by Django management commands like `makemessages`
- Provides two doctest examples showing expected behavior with normal inputs

The docstring examples all use valid, non-empty extensions like 'html', 'js', 'py', 'txt', '.tpl', etc.
No example shows what should happen with empty extensions or malformed input.

DJANGO OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
-------------------------------
The Django documentation for the `makemessages` command shows:
- Default extensions are: html, txt, py, and js (for djangojs domain)
- Extensions can be specified as comma-separated lists or multiple --extension flags
- Examples always show valid, meaningful extensions

The documentation does not explicitly state:
- What constitutes a valid file extension
- How to handle empty strings or malformed input
- Whether '.' alone is a valid extension

FILE EXTENSION SEMANTICS:
--------------------------
From testing Python's standard library behavior:
1. `os.path.splitext()` treats:
   - 'file.txt' as having extension '.txt'
   - 'file.' as having extension '.' (though unusual)
   - '.' alone has no extension (empty string)

2. `pathlib.Path.suffix`:
   - Returns empty string for 'file.' and '.'
   - Only returns actual extensions like '.txt'

3. File system semantics:
   - '.' has special meaning as "current directory"
   - Files named just '.' cannot exist in most filesystems
   - An extension of just '.' is semantically meaningless

CONCLUSION ON DOCUMENTATION:
-----------------------------
The documentation does NOT explicitly define what happens with empty extensions or specify that '.' should not be returned. However:

1. All documented examples use meaningful, non-empty extensions
2. The function's purpose is to "organize" extensions for file matching
3. A lone '.' is not a valid file extension in any practical sense
4. The function is used by commands that need to match actual files with real extensions

The lack of explicit documentation about edge cases suggests this is an implementation detail that wasn't fully considered. The current behavior with empty strings producing '.' appears to be an unintended consequence rather than a deliberate design choice.
