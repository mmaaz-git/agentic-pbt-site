## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Execution
I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The test code provided in the bug report runs correctly and demonstrates the issue.

### Results of Running Reproduction Code
1. **Filebased Backend**: Returns `None` when `send_messages([])` is called with empty list
2. **Console Backend**: Returns `None` when `send_messages([])` is called with empty list
3. **SMTP Backend**: Returns `0` when `send_messages([])` is called with empty list
4. **Locmem Backend**: Returns `0` when `send_messages([])` is called with empty list

### Type Error Confirmation
When attempting `filebased_result > 0`, a TypeError is raised:
```
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'
```

This confirms the bug report's claim that the return value breaks comparison operations.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **Root Cause**: The bug is in `django/core/mail/backends/console.py` at lines 30-31:
   ```python
   def send_messages(self, email_messages):
       if not email_messages:
           return  # Returns None instead of 0
   ```

2. **Inheritance Chain**: `filebased.EmailBackend` inherits from `console.EmailBackend`:
   ```python
   class EmailBackend(ConsoleEmailBackend):
   ```
   This means filebased backend inherits the buggy behavior.

3. **Correct Implementations**: Both SMTP and locmem backends correctly handle empty message lists:
   - SMTP explicitly returns 0: `if not email_messages: return 0`
   - Locmem returns 0 through its loop logic (0 iterations = msg_count stays 0)

### Impact
The bug causes:
1. Type inconsistency across backends (NoneType vs int)
2. Inability to use the return value in numeric comparisons
3. Violation of backend substitutability - cannot transparently swap backends
4. Code expecting an integer count will fail with NoneType errors

The bug is accurately described and the reproduction steps work exactly as reported.
