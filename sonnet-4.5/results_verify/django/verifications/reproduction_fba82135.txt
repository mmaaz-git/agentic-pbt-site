Bug Reproduction Results

1. Hypothesis Test Results:
The hypothesis test FAILS as reported. When testing with the input '"' (single quote character):
- First call: quote_etag('"') returns '"""'
- Second call: quote_etag('"""') returns '"""""'
- These are NOT equal, demonstrating non-idempotence

2. Specific Test Case Verification:
Input:  '"'
Once:   '"""'    (wraps the single quote in quotes)
Twice:  '"""""'  (wraps the three quotes in quotes again)
Thrice: '"""""""' (continues adding quotes)

The bug report's claim about unbounded string growth is CONFIRMED. Each subsequent call adds two more quotes.

3. Additional Test Cases:
- Normal strings like 'hello' work correctly (idempotent)
- Already properly quoted strings like '"hello"' work correctly (idempotent)
- Weak ETags like 'W/"hello"' work correctly (idempotent)
- Empty quotes '""' work correctly (idempotent)
- BUT any string containing quotes within what should be the "value" part fails:
  - '"""' -> '"""""' -> '"""""""' (not idempotent)
  - '"hello' -> '""hello"' -> '"""hello""' (not idempotent)
  - 'hello"' -> '"hello""' -> '""hello"""' (not idempotent)

4. Root Cause Analysis:
The ETAG_MATCH regex pattern uses [^"]* which means "match zero or more non-quote characters". This correctly implements the RFC 9110 specification which forbids quotes within ETag values.

When quote_etag receives '"':
- It doesn't match the regex (single quote, not a valid ETag format)
- Gets wrapped to become '"""'
- '"""' still doesn't match the regex (middle character is a quote, violating [^"]*)
- Gets wrapped again to become '"""""'
- This continues indefinitely

5. Technical Accuracy:
The bug reproduction is technically accurate. The function does exhibit non-idempotent behavior when given inputs containing quote characters. However, this occurs specifically because such inputs produce INVALID ETags according to the HTTP specification.
