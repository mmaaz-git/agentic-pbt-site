## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report might be invalid if Django intentionally marks Azerbaijani as bidi for historical reasons, since the language did use Arabic script until 1929. Perhaps there's an undocumented design decision to support legacy content or historical texts in Arabic script Azerbaijani. The documentation doesn't explicitly state that bidi must match the current script, so this could be working as intended for some unspecified reason.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The evidence strongly suggests this is not invalid. All other bidi=True languages use scripts that are actually RTL in their name_local field. The consistent pattern across 7 out of 8 languages shows that bidi should reflect the current writing system. The name_local field itself uses Latin script "Azərbaycanca", not Arabic, indicating Django recognizes modern Azerbaijani uses Latin script. The practical impact is that Azerbaijani UIs will render incorrectly with RTL layout.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be WONTFIX if Django considers this a legacy issue that's been present for many years and changing it now might break existing applications that have worked around this behavior. Some developers might have already compensated for the incorrect bidi setting in their Azerbaijani localizations. The issue only affects Azerbaijani users, which might be a small user base.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a clear data error that causes incorrect rendering for an entire language. It's not a minor edge case but affects all Django applications using Azerbaijani localization. The fix is trivial (changing one boolean value) with minimal risk. Other applications are unlikely to depend on incorrect bidi behavior, and any that do are already broken. This is exactly the kind of straightforward bug that should be fixed.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If Django intended Azerbaijani to be marked as bidi for historical compatibility reasons, then the documentation should explain this exception. The documentation could be updated to clarify that some languages are marked bidi for historical reasons even if they currently use LTR scripts. This would make the current behavior "correct" but poorly documented.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There's no evidence this is intentional behavior that needs documentation. All other evidence points to this being a data error, not a documentation issue. The pattern is clear: languages using RTL scripts get bidi=True, those using LTR scripts get bidi=False. Documenting a bug doesn't make it correct behavior. The fix should be to the data, not to documentation explaining why the data is wrong.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue this is requesting a new feature to "support modern Azerbaijani with correct text direction" if the current implementation was only designed for historical Azerbaijani. Perhaps adding proper modern Azerbaijani support with LTR rendering is an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not asking for new functionality but correcting existing incorrect data. Django already supports Azerbaijani ('az') in LANG_INFO, it's just marked with the wrong bidi value. The infrastructure for LTR languages already exists and works correctly for dozens of other languages. This is fixing a mistake, not adding a feature. The language entry exists, it's just misconfigured.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is clearly a bug. Azerbaijani has used Latin script officially since 1991 (over 30 years). The name_local field contains Latin characters, proving Django intends to support modern Azerbaijani. When rendered with bidi=True, Azerbaijani text displays incorrectly with RTL layout, breaking user interfaces. Every other bidi=True language uses actual RTL scripts. The test case demonstrates the inconsistency objectively. The fix is simple and obvious.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if there's some hidden, undocumented reason for marking Azerbaijani as bidi that we're not aware of. However, no such reason is evident in the code, documentation, or commit history. The practical impact and clear pattern violation strongly indicate this is indeed a bug.

## Overall consideration
After careful analysis, this is unquestionably a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming: Azerbaijani is the only language out of 8 marked as bidi=True that uses Latin script in its name_local field. The character analysis confirms "Azərbaycanca" contains only Latin characters (including Latin schwa ə), with no RTL script characters. Modern Azerbaijani has used Latin script officially for over 30 years, since 1991.

The practical impact is significant - any Django application using Azerbaijani localization will incorrectly render text with right-to-left layout, causing text to be right-aligned and potentially affecting reading order. This is not a theoretical issue but a real rendering bug that affects user experience. The test case provided clearly demonstrates the inconsistency using a reasonable property-based approach.

While one might speculate about historical reasons (Azerbaijani did use Arabic script until 1929), Django's own data contradicts this by using the modern Latin spelling in name_local. If Django intended to support historical Arabic-script Azerbaijani, the name_local would be in Arabic script. The fix is trivial and risk-free - simply changing bidi from True to False for the 'az' language code. This is exactly the type of clear, objective data error that should be reported and fixed as a bug.
