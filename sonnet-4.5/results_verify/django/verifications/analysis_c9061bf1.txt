## Bug Report Analysis

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This could be considered invalid if Django never intended to support dictionaries with mixed-type keys in migrations. The documentation doesn't explicitly state that mixed-type keys should be supported, and such dictionaries are uncommon in typical Django usage. Migration serialization might be designed only for homogeneous key types.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug causes a clear crash with a Python TypeError when attempting to serialize valid Python dictionaries. Python dictionaries support mixed-type keys, and Django's documentation lists dict as a serializable type without mentioning any restrictions on key types. The crash is not a graceful failure but an unhandled exception.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Mixed-type dictionary keys are extremely rare in Django migrations. Model field defaults, migration operations, and field configurations typically use dictionaries with consistent key types. The use case is so obscure that fixing it might not be worth the maintenance burden or potential side effects of changing the sorting behavior.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial (adding `key=repr` to the sorted call) and follows an existing pattern already used in BaseUnorderedSequenceSerializer. The code change is minimal and unlikely to break existing functionality since it only affects dictionaries that currently crash. Not fixing means Django can't serialize valid Python data structures.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to specify that dictionary keys in migrations must be of the same type. This would clarify the limitation and set proper expectations. The current behavior could be considered "working as designed" if the limitation is documented.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is a crash, not a misunderstanding of documented behavior. The code fails with an unhandled exception rather than providing a useful error message. If this were intended behavior, the code should validate the dictionary and raise a descriptive error, not crash with a comparison TypeError.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting mixed-type dictionary keys could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. Django may have never intended to support this edge case, and adding support would be an enhancement to handle more diverse data structures.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The code already attempts to serialize dictionaries - it just fails on certain valid inputs. This is fixing broken functionality rather than adding new capabilities. The serializer claims to support dict type but fails on some valid dicts.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The DictionarySerializer crashes with an unhandled TypeError when given valid Python dictionaries with mixed-type keys. The same codebase already uses `key=repr` in BaseUnorderedSequenceSerializer (line 60) showing awareness of this sorting issue. The fix is trivial and follows established patterns. The crash prevents legitimate use cases where mixed-type keys might appear in field defaults or custom migration operations.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The use case is extremely rare and may never occur in real Django projects. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise support for all possible dictionary configurations. This could be considered an unsupported edge case rather than a bug in core functionality.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at all the considerations, this appears to be a legitimate bug, though of low severity. The code crashes with an unhandled exception on valid Python input, which is clearly incorrect behavior. The fact that BaseUnorderedSequenceSerializer already uses `key=repr` for sorting (line 60) demonstrates that Django developers are aware of the need to handle heterogeneous types when sorting.

The fix is minimal and follows an established pattern within the same file. While mixed-type dictionary keys are uncommon in Django migrations, they are valid Python and could reasonably appear in custom migration operations or third-party Django applications. The serializer should either handle them correctly or fail gracefully with a clear error message, not crash with a TypeError.

However, given the rarity of this use case and the fact that it's unlikely to affect real-world Django applications, this could also be reasonably classified as WONTFIX. The maintainers might decide the edge case is too obscure to warrant a fix, especially if there are concerns about changing long-standing behavior in the migration system.
