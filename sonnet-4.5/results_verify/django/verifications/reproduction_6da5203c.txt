Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs exactly as stated.

Test Results:
-------------

1. **Exact Bug Reproduction**:
   - When `ModelFormMixin.get_success_url()` is called with `success_url = "/object/{id}/success"`
   - And the object has an empty `__dict__` (no 'id' attribute)
   - The method raises a bare `KeyError: 'id'`
   - This matches the bug report exactly

2. **Verified Behavior**:
   - The error occurs at line 120 of `django/views/generic/edit.py`
   - The problematic line: `url = self.success_url.format(**self.object.__dict__)`
   - No try/except block exists around this format() call
   - The KeyError is unhelpful - it just says 'id' without context

3. **Additional Testing**:
   - Tested with multiple missing placeholders: all raise bare KeyError
   - Tested with valid object attributes: works correctly
   - Tested with multiple placeholders where some are missing: fails on first missing one

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Created property-based tests that generate various URL templates
   - All templates with placeholders that don't exist in the object raise KeyError
   - The error message provides no context about where the error occurred

Confirmation:
------------
The bug is real and behaves exactly as described. The current implementation:
- Raises an unhelpful KeyError when placeholders don't match object attributes
- Provides no context about what went wrong
- Does not follow Django's pattern of raising ImproperlyConfigured for configuration issues
- Makes debugging difficult for developers who encounter this issue
