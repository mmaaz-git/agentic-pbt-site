TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluation for each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE A BUG:
   - The function crashes with ValueError instead of failing silently as documented
   - Documentation states "Return the original value for invalid input" but it raises an exception
   - Documentation states "output is always an integer" (or original value), implying no exceptions
   - The function already handles negative numbers correctly for valid digit positions
   - The function already has error handling (try-except for IndexError) but misses ValueError
   - This is an unexpected crash for reasonable input (negative integers are valid integers)

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE A BUG:
   - None. This clearly violates the documented behavior.

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE INVALID:
   - Could argue that accessing the minus sign is "undefined behavior"

   WHY IT'S NOT INVALID:
   - The documentation explicitly states the function should "Return the original value for invalid input"
   - Negative integers are valid integers ("whole numbers" in programming context)
   - The function already accepts negative numbers and works correctly for digit positions
   - Raising an exception violates the documented "fail silently" behavior

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE WONTFIX:
   - Could be considered an edge case (accessing position of minus sign)
   - Might argue users shouldn't use positions that reach the minus sign

   WHY IT'S NOT WONTFIX:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - negative numbers are common
   - The crash is unexpected and violates documented behavior
   - The fix is trivial (add ValueError to the except clause)
   - This affects template rendering which is user-facing

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could argue handling negative numbers "properly" is a new feature

   WHY IT'S NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The function already accepts negative numbers
   - This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
   - The documentation already specifies how invalid input should be handled

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - Could update docs to say "raises ValueError for certain inputs"

   WHY IT'S NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The current documentation's promise to "fail silently" is reasonable
   - The code has a bug (missing exception handler), not the documentation
   - Changing docs to allow crashes would be a worse user experience

CONCLUSION:
This is clearly a BUG. The function violates its documented contract by raising an exception instead of returning the original value for invalid input. The function already:
1. Accepts negative numbers as valid input
2. Has error handling for IndexError
3. Documents that it should fail silently

The bug is that the error handling is incomplete - it catches IndexError but not ValueError. This is a straightforward bug with a simple fix (add ValueError to the except clause).
