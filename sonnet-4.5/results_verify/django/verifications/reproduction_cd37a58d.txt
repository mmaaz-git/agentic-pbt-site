## Bug Reproduction Report

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Test Results

1. **Test Case: `'://example.com'`**
   - Expected: Should trigger an error (no scheme before ://)
   - Actual: NO ERROR generated
   - Bug CONFIRMED: The validation incorrectly accepts this malformed origin

2. **Test Case: `'example.com://foo'`**
   - Expected: Should trigger an error (scheme not at start)
   - Actual: NO ERROR generated
   - Bug CONFIRMED: The validation incorrectly accepts this malformed origin

3. **Test Case: `'https://example.com'`**
   - Expected: No error (valid origin)
   - Actual: No error
   - Working as expected

4. **Test Case: `'example.com'`**
   - Expected: Should trigger an error (no scheme)
   - Actual: ERROR generated
   - Working as expected

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug exists in the validation logic at line 10 of django_4_0.py:
```python
if "://" not in origin:
```

This check only verifies that the string "://" appears somewhere in the origin, but doesn't verify:
1. That there is a non-empty scheme before "://"
2. That the "://" appears at the correct position (after the scheme)

### Impact on Django's CSRF Protection

When Django's CSRF middleware uses `urlsplit()` on these malformed origins:
- `'://example.com'` is parsed with empty scheme and netloc, treating the whole string as a path
- `'example.com://foo'` is parsed with 'example.com' as the scheme and 'foo' as the netloc

This means the CSRF protection may not work correctly with these malformed origins, as the netloc extraction will fail or produce unexpected results.

### Hypothesis Test Verification

The hypothesis test correctly identifies the bug:
- It asserts that origins with "://" at index 0 should produce errors
- The test fails because Django doesn't generate errors for these cases
- This confirms the bug report is accurate
