BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. REPRODUCING THE REPORTED BUG:
The bug report claims that calling msg.attach(filename=None, content=b"test content", mimetype=None) raises a TypeError.

TEST RESULT: CONFIRMED
When I ran the exact reproduction code from the bug report, it failed with:
"TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType"

This error occurs at line 333 in django/core/mail/message.py when mimetypes.guess_type(None) is called.

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
The property-based test using Hypothesis also failed with the same error on the first example (content=b'').
The test tries to attach content with filename=None and mimetype=None, and it consistently fails with TypeError.

3. ADDITIONAL TESTING:

Test with None filename: FAILS with TypeError
Test with empty string filename: SUCCEEDS (empty string is a valid path-like object)
Test with valid filename: SUCCEEDS (normal usage works as expected)

4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The error occurs at this line in the source code:
mimetype = mimetype or mimetypes.guess_type(filename)[0] or DEFAULT_ATTACHMENT_MIME_TYPE

The Python standard library's mimetypes.guess_type() function does not accept None as input. It requires:
- str (a filename or URL)
- bytes (a filename)
- os.PathLike object

When filename=None, this call fails immediately with TypeError.

5. PROPOSED FIX VERIFICATION:
The bug report suggests this fix:
mimetype = mimetype or (mimetypes.guess_type(filename)[0] if filename else None) or DEFAULT_ATTACHMENT_MIME_TYPE

This would:
- Only call mimetypes.guess_type() if filename is not None
- Fall back to DEFAULT_ATTACHMENT_MIME_TYPE if filename is None
- Maintain backward compatibility for valid filenames

6. DOCSTRING vs IMPLEMENTATION MISMATCH:
The docstring states: "The filename can be omitted and the mimetype is guessed, if not provided."
The implementation does not handle the case where filename is None/omitted.
This is a clear discrepancy between documented behavior and actual implementation.

SUMMARY:
The bug is reproducible exactly as reported. The code crashes when filename=None despite the docstring explicitly stating that "The filename can be omitted". The proposed fix appears reasonable and would align the implementation with the documented behavior.
