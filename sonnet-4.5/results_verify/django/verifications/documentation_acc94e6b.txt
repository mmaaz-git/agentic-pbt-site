## Documentation Analysis for truncate_name Function

### Official Documentation
After searching Django's official documentation and source code, I found that:

1. **No explicit public documentation exists** for the `truncate_name` function in Django's official documentation
2. The function is considered an **internal utility function** and is not part of Django's public API
3. No mention of idempotence requirements in official docs

### Source Code Documentation (Docstring)
The only documentation is the docstring in `/django/db/backends/utils.py`:

```python
def truncate_name(identifier, length=None, hash_len=4):
    """
    Shorten an SQL identifier to a repeatable mangled version with the given
    length.

    If a quote stripped name contains a namespace, e.g. USERNAME"."TABLE,
    truncate the table portion only.
    """
```

Key observations:
- The docstring mentions "repeatable mangled version" which implies deterministic behavior
- No explicit mention that the function should be idempotent
- No mention of what happens when `length < hash_len`
- No specification of the actual length guarantee of the output

### Usage Context in Django Codebase
The function is used internally in:
- `django/db/models/options.py` - for truncating table names
- `django/db/models/fields/related.py` - for foreign key constraint names
- `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` - for index and constraint names
- `django/db/backends/oracle/operations.py` - Oracle-specific name truncation

### Implicit Expectations
Based on usage patterns in Django's codebase:
1. The function is consistently called with database-specific max name lengths
2. It's used to ensure identifiers fit within database constraints
3. The "repeatable" mention in the docstring suggests deterministic output for same input
4. No code appears to call truncate_name multiple times on the same identifier

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say
1. **No idempotence guarantee**: The documentation never explicitly states that `truncate_name(truncate_name(x, L), L) == truncate_name(x, L)`
2. **No length guarantee**: The documentation doesn't promise that the output will be ≤ `length` characters
3. **No behavior specification for edge cases**: What happens when `length < hash_len` is undefined
4. **No public API commitment**: Being an internal utility, there's no API stability guarantee

### Conclusion
The documentation is insufficient to determine whether:
- Idempotence is a required property
- The output must be ≤ `length` characters
- The behavior when `length < hash_len` is intentional or a bug

The function appears to be an internal implementation detail not covered by Django's public API guarantees. The lack of explicit documentation about these behaviors leaves the reported issues in a gray area - they could be considered bugs, or they could be acceptable behavior for an internal utility function that's never meant to be called with `length < hash_len`.
