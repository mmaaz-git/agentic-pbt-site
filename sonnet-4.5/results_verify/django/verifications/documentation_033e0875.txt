## Documentation Analysis for get_exception_info Function

### Function Purpose
The `get_exception_info` function is documented with a docstring that states:
"Format exception information for display on the debug page using the structure described in the template API documentation."

This function is part of Django's Jinja2 template backend and is called when a TemplateSyntaxError occurs during template parsing or rendering.

### Implementation Details
From the source code in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/template/backends/jinja2.py`:

1. The function takes a Jinja2 exception object as input
2. It extracts the `lineno`, `source`, and `filename` attributes from the exception
3. If `source` is None, it attempts to read the template file from disk
4. **Key behavior**: At line 105, the source is processed with `source.strip().split("\n")`
5. Lines are enumerated starting from 1
6. The function returns a dictionary with debug information including the line content at the error

### Documentation Findings

1. **Django Documentation**:
   - The Django documentation does not provide specific details about how `get_exception_info` should handle whitespace or line numbering
   - The function is used internally for debug page formatting
   - The template API documentation mentioned in the docstring does not explicitly specify behavior for leading/trailing whitespace

2. **Jinja2 Documentation**:
   - Jinja2's TemplateSyntaxError includes a `lineno` attribute that represents the line number in the template
   - The documentation does not explicitly state whether `lineno` counts from the original source or from a stripped version
   - Based on standard practice, line numbers in error reporting typically refer to the original source file

3. **No Explicit Contract**:
   - There is no explicit documentation stating that the function should strip whitespace before calculating line numbers
   - The docstring only mentions "Format exception information for display" without specifying transformation rules
   - The behavior of stripping whitespace appears to be an implementation detail not covered in documentation

### Implications
The lack of explicit documentation about whitespace handling means that the current behavior (stripping whitespace) is not explicitly guaranteed or forbidden. However, the purpose stated in the docstring - to format exception information for debugging - suggests that the displayed line should correspond to what Jinja2 reports as the error line.
