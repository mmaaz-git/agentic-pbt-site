## Documentation Findings for handle_extensions Function

### Function Purpose and Documentation
The `handle_extensions` function in `django.core.management.utils` is documented with the following specification:

1. **Purpose**: "Organize multiple extensions that are separated with commas or passed by using --extension/-e multiple times."

2. **Examples in Docstring**:
   - Input: `['.html', 'html,js,py,py,py,.py', 'py,.py']` → Output: `{'.html', '.js', '.py'}`
   - Input: `['.html, txt,.tpl']` → Output: `{'.html', '.tpl', '.txt'}`

3. **Usage Context**: The function is primarily used by the `makemessages` management command for processing file extensions during internationalization tasks.

### What the Documentation Specifies
- The function accepts a list of strings containing file extensions
- Extensions can be comma-separated within strings
- Extensions can have spaces around them (they get removed)
- Extensions may or may not have a leading dot (the function adds one if missing)
- The function returns a set of unique, normalized extensions with dots

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify
- **How to handle empty strings**: The documentation does not explicitly state what should happen when:
  - An empty string is passed as input (`['']`)
  - Double commas create empty segments (`['html,,css']`)
  - Leading/trailing commas create empty segments (`[',html']` or `['html,']`)

- **What constitutes a "valid" extension**: The documentation doesn't define what makes an extension valid or invalid. It doesn't say whether a single dot '.' is considered valid.

- **Error handling**: No mention of how the function should handle malformed input or edge cases.

### Relevant Context from makemessages Command
The `makemessages` command imports and uses `handle_extensions` directly. The command documentation states that users should "Separate multiple extensions with commas" when using the `--extension` flag. This suggests that comma-separated inputs are an expected user-facing interface.

### Key Observation
The documentation examples only show "normal" cases with valid extension names. There are no examples showing how edge cases with empty strings or malformed input should be handled. The docstring does not explicitly promise to filter out invalid extensions or validate the output.
