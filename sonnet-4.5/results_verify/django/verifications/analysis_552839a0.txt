## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**

1. **Documentation Violation**: The code explicitly violates its own documentation. The docstring states it should handle "any sequence of sequences whose first items are language codes" but fails for sequences with single-character first elements.

2. **Type Confusion**: The code uses a fragile heuristic (`len(language[0]) > 1`) instead of proper type checking (`isinstance(language, str)`), which is a clear logic error.

3. **Legitimate Use Cases Fail**: Single-character language codes exist (e.g., some custom or internal codes), and the function should handle them according to the documentation.

4. **Clear Fix Available**: The bug has an obvious, clean fix that makes the code more robust and maintainable.

5. **Not Edge Case**: This affects any sequence with a single-character first element, which is a predictable scenario, not an obscure edge case.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is a clear violation of documented behavior.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**

1. Could argue that single-character language codes are non-standard in practice.

**Arguments AGAINST:**

1. The documentation explicitly states "any sequence" without length restrictions.
2. The code comment confirms it should handle sequences with language code as first item.
3. The bug is in the implementation logic, not in the usage pattern.

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**

1. Single-character language codes might be extremely rare in practice.
2. The bug has likely existed for a long time without many complaints.

**Arguments AGAINST:**

1. The fix is trivial and makes the code more correct and maintainable.
2. The current implementation is objectively wrong and uses a fragile heuristic.
3. Even if rare, the documented behavior should be honored.
4. The fix improves code quality by using proper type checking.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**

1. Could update documentation to say "sequences whose first items are multi-character language codes."

**Arguments AGAINST:**

1. The code is wrong, not the documentation. Type checking should use `isinstance()`, not string length heuristics.
2. Restricting to multi-character codes would be an arbitrary limitation.
3. The fix to the code is cleaner than changing the documentation to match broken behavior.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**

1. Could argue that supporting single-character codes is a new feature.

**Arguments AGAINST:**

1. The documentation already promises this functionality.
2. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features.
3. The code comment indicates this was always intended to work.

## Conclusion

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The code:

1. Violates its own explicit documentation
2. Uses an incorrect and fragile heuristic for type checking
3. Fails on legitimate inputs that should work per the documentation
4. Has a clear, simple fix that improves code quality

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, provides reproducible test cases, and correctly identifies both the problem and the solution. This should be filed as a valid bug that needs fixing.
