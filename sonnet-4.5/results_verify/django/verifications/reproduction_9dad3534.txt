## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Setup
Successfully reproduced the bug using both the provided test code and custom test scripts in a Django environment.

### Test Results

#### Test 1: Prefix "/"
When calling `static("/")`:
- Generated pattern: `^(?P<path>.*)$`
- This pattern matches EVERY possible URL:
  - Matches empty string ''
  - Matches 'admin/'
  - Matches 'api/users/123'
  - Matches 'any/arbitrary/url'

#### Test 2: Normal Prefix "/media/"
When calling `static("/media/")`:
- Generated pattern: `^media/(?P<path>.*)$`
- This pattern only matches URLs starting with "media/":
  - Does NOT match empty string ''
  - Does NOT match 'admin/'
  - DOES match 'media/file.jpg'
  - Does NOT match 'api/users/123'

#### Test 3: Empty Prefix ""
When calling `static("")`:
- Correctly raises: `ImproperlyConfigured: Empty static prefix not permitted`

#### Test 4: Multiple Slashes "//"
When calling `static("//")`:
- Generated pattern: `^(?P<path>.*)$`
- Also matches all URLs (same problem as "/")

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test from the bug report runs successfully and confirms:
- All slash-only prefixes ("/", "//", "///", "////") generate the same overly-broad pattern
- All of them result in `^(?P<path>.*)$` which matches every URL

### Technical Analysis
The root cause is in line 28 of static.py:
```python
r"^%s(?P<path>.*)$" % re.escape(prefix.lstrip("/"))
```

When prefix="/":
1. `prefix.lstrip("/")` returns empty string ""
2. `re.escape("")` returns empty string ""
3. Pattern becomes `^(?P<path>.*)$`
4. This matches ALL URLs in the application

### Impact Verification
The bug is real and has serious implications:
1. Using `static("/")` would cause the static file handler to intercept ALL requests
2. This would break normal URL routing for admin, API endpoints, and all other views
3. The behavior is inconsistent with the explicit validation that rejects empty prefixes

The bug report's claims are accurate and the reproduction is successful.
