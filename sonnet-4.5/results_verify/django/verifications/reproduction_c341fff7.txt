## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test correctly identifies the issue. When `file_path=None` is provided and there's no `EMAIL_FILE_PATH` setting, the code raises a `TypeError` instead of the expected `ImproperlyConfigured` exception.

2. **Manual Reproduction**:
   - When calling `EmailBackend(file_path=None)` with no `EMAIL_FILE_PATH` setting, a `TypeError` is raised: "expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType"
   - The same error occurs when calling `EmailBackend()` with no arguments and no `EMAIL_FILE_PATH` setting

3. **Stack Trace Analysis**: The error occurs at line 18 in filebased.py:
   ```python
   self.file_path = os.path.abspath(self.file_path)
   ```
   This line attempts to call `os.path.abspath()` on `None`, which causes the TypeError.

### Comparison with Other Error Cases

The code properly handles other configuration errors with `ImproperlyConfigured`:
- When the path exists as a file (not directory): Raises `ImproperlyConfigured` with clear message
- When the directory is not writable: Raises `ImproperlyConfigured` with clear message
- When directory creation fails: Raises `ImproperlyConfigured` with clear message

### Bug Confirmed

The bug is real and reproducible. The code fails to validate that a file path has been provided (either through the parameter or settings) before attempting to use it, resulting in an unhelpful `TypeError` instead of the more appropriate `ImproperlyConfigured` exception that is used for other configuration errors in the same method.
