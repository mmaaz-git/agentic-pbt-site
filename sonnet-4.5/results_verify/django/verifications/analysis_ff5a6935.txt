## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report complains about empty templates showing 1 line instead of 0. However, there's no documentation specifying that empty templates should have 0 lines. The current behavior follows Python's standard str.split('\n') behavior, which returns [''] for empty strings. This could be considered the expected behavior since an empty file technically has one (empty) line from a text editor perspective.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug is reproducible and the behavior is counterintuitive - most developers would expect an empty template to have 0 lines, not 1. Additionally, I discovered a more serious issue: the code crashes with IndexError when lineno > 1 on empty templates, which is definitely a bug.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The line count issue is purely cosmetic and only affects debug output. Empty templates are extremely rare in production code. The effort to fix this minor inconsistency might not be worth it, especially since it doesn't affect functionality - just the debug message showing "1 line" vs "0 lines" for empty templates.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The IndexError crash I discovered (when lineno > 1 with empty source) is a real bug that causes exceptions. While rare, this could happen if Jinja2 reports an error on line 2+ of what turns out to be an empty or missing template file. This crash is not just cosmetic and should be fixed.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function lacks clear documentation about edge cases. The behavior for empty templates could be documented as intentional - that empty templates are considered to have 1 empty line. This would clarify the expected behavior without changing code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The IndexError crash is clearly a bug, not a documentation issue. Also, documenting that "empty templates have 1 line" seems like documenting a quirk rather than intended behavior. The function is internal and not part of the public API, so detailed documentation of edge cases may not be necessary.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The request to have empty templates show 0 lines could be seen as an enhancement request for better debug output. The current behavior works but could be improved for clarity. This would be adding new behavior rather than fixing broken behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The IndexError crash is clearly a bug, not a missing feature. Additionally, accurate line counting in debug output is basic functionality, not an enhancement. The expectation that empty sources have 0 lines is reasonable and intuitive.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
I discovered that the code crashes with IndexError when lineno > 1 and source is empty. This is a clear bug - the code should handle this case gracefully. Additionally, reporting 1 line for empty templates is misleading and could confuse developers debugging template issues. The proposed fix is simple and reasonable.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The line count issue alone (without the crash) is minor and cosmetic. The function works correctly for all non-empty templates, which covers 99.9% of real use cases. The behavior follows Python's standard string splitting behavior, so it's not technically "wrong" - just unintuitive.

## Overall consideration
Upon careful analysis, while the originally reported issue about line counting might seem trivial, my investigation revealed a more serious problem: the code crashes with an IndexError when processing empty templates with lineno > 1. This transforms what initially appeared to be a cosmetic issue into a legitimate bug that can cause exceptions in Django's error handling code.

The fact that empty templates report 1 line instead of 0 is counterintuitive and the proposed fix is reasonable. The fix would prevent both the incorrect line count and the potential IndexError. While empty templates are rare, they can occur during development, and Django's debug page should handle all edge cases gracefully without crashing.

Given that there's an actual crash bug (IndexError) in addition to the cosmetic issue, and the fix is simple and correct, this should be classified as a BUG. The code fails to handle edge cases properly and can throw exceptions in scenarios that, while rare, are still possible in real-world usage.
