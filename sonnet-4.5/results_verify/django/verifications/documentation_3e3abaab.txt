DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR django.conf.urls.static.static()

SOURCE CODE REVIEW:
The function is defined in django/conf/urls/static.py with the following docstring:
"Return a URL pattern for serving files in debug mode."

The function signature is:
def static(prefix, view=serve, **kwargs)

KEY DOCUMENTATION POINTS:

1. The function's docstring provides a basic example but does not specify:
   - What constitutes a valid prefix
   - Whether "/" is a valid prefix
   - How the prefix is processed internally
   - What the expected behavior is for slash-only prefixes

2. The only explicit validation mentioned in the code is at line 21:
   "if not prefix: raise ImproperlyConfigured("Empty static prefix not permitted")"
   This error message clearly states that empty prefixes are not permitted.

3. The actual implementation at line 28 shows:
   r"^%s(?P<path>.*)$" % re.escape(prefix.lstrip("/"))

   This strips leading slashes from the prefix before creating the regex pattern.
   However, this behavior is NOT documented anywhere in the docstring or Django's public documentation.

4. Django's public documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/urls/#django.conf.urls.static.static)
   provides minimal information - only showing example usage with settings.MEDIA_URL, which typically
   would be something like "/media/" not just "/".

5. There is no explicit documentation stating:
   - That "/" should be treated as invalid
   - That prefixes consisting only of slashes should be rejected
   - The rationale behind the lstrip("/") operation
   - What the resulting URL pattern should look like for edge cases

DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
- No specification for handling slash-only prefixes
- No explanation of the prefix.lstrip("/") preprocessing
- No clear contract about what makes a prefix "empty" (before or after stripping)
- No examples showing edge cases or invalid inputs

The error message "Empty static prefix not permitted" suggests an intent to prevent empty prefixes,
but the documentation does not clarify whether this applies before or after the lstrip("/") operation.
