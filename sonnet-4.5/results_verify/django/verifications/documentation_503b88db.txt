# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation

### Source Code Comment
The only documentation found is in the source code comment at line 41-42 of `django/templatetags/i18n.py`:
```python
# ``language`` is either a language code string or a sequence
# with the language code as its first item
```

This comment clearly states that the `get_language_info` method should handle:
1. Language code strings (e.g., "en", "fr", "ar-dz")
2. Sequences with the language code as the first item (e.g., ("en", "English"))

### Template Tag Documentation (do_get_language_info_list)
The docstring for `do_get_language_info_list` states:
```
Store a list of language information dictionaries for the given language
codes in a context variable. The language codes can be specified either as
a list of strings or a settings.LANGUAGES style list (or any sequence of
sequences whose first items are language codes).
```

This confirms that the template tag should accept:
- A list of strings: `["en", "fr", "de"]`
- A settings.LANGUAGES style list: `[("en", "English"), ("fr", "French")]`
- Any sequence of sequences whose first items are language codes

### Django's Language Code Format
Examining Django's `LANG_INFO` dictionary reveals:
- Django uses language codes like "af", "ar", "ar-dz", "en", "en-au", etc.
- No single-character language codes exist in Django's built-in LANG_INFO
- All built-in language codes are 2+ characters

## Key Findings

1. **The documentation is clear**: The function should handle both strings and sequences (tuples).

2. **No restriction on language code length**: Neither the documentation nor the code comments specify any restriction on the length of language codes. The documentation simply says "language code string" without specifying length requirements.

3. **The implementation contradicts the documentation**: The current implementation uses `len(language[0]) > 1` as a heuristic to distinguish between strings and tuples, which is not mentioned in the documentation and contradicts the stated behavior.

4. **Single-character codes are theoretically valid**: While Django doesn't ship with single-character language codes, nothing in the documentation prohibits them. Users could add custom language codes to their settings, including single-character ones.

## Conclusion

The documentation clearly states that the function should handle "a language code string or a sequence with the language code as its first item." The current implementation fails to correctly handle sequences when the first item (language code) is a single character. This is a violation of the documented behavior, not undefined behavior.
