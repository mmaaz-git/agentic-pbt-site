DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Official Documentation (from docstring):
"Given a whole number, return the requested digit of it, where 1 is the right-most digit, 2 is the second-right-most digit, etc. Return the original value for invalid input (if input or argument is not an integer, or if argument is less than 1). Otherwise, output is always an integer."

Key Points from Documentation:
1. Function expects a "whole number" as input
2. Returns the requested digit counting from right (1-indexed)
3. For INVALID INPUT, should "Return the original value"
4. Invalid input is defined as:
   - Input is not an integer
   - Argument is not an integer
   - Argument is less than 1
5. "Otherwise, output is always an integer"

Analysis of Bug Against Documentation:

The documentation states that for "invalid input" the function should "Return the original value". However, it does NOT clearly define what happens when:
- The position exists in the string representation but is not a digit (like the minus sign)
- The position is out of range (though the code returns 0 for this case)

The current implementation:
- Returns 0 for out-of-range positions (IndexError)
- Crashes with ValueError when position points to minus sign

The documentation says "output is always an integer" (or the original value for invalid input). This suggests the function should never raise an exception during normal operation.

Key Finding:
The function violates its own documented behavior of "failing silently" by raising a ValueError instead of returning either:
1. The original value (as it does for other invalid inputs)
2. 0 (as it does for out-of-range positions)

The documentation doesn't explicitly state how to handle negative numbers, but:
1. Negative integers ARE valid integers (they are "whole numbers" in programming context)
2. The function already accepts and processes negative numbers correctly when accessing actual digit positions
3. The crash only occurs when accessing the minus sign position

Therefore, this is a legitimate bug - the function should handle this case gracefully rather than crashing.
