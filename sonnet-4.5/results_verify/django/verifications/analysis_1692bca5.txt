## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Categorization Considerations

#### 1. BUG - Arguments For:
- **Functionality is broken**: Using `use_caching=True` with common sender types (strings, integers, None) causes a TypeError
- **Inconsistent behavior**: The same code works with `use_caching=False` but fails with `use_caching=True`
- **Runtime surprise**: The error occurs at send() time, not at connect() time, making it harder to detect
- **Common use case affected**: String senders are widely used in Django applications
- **Clear violation of expectations**: Users would reasonably expect all sender types that work without caching to also work with caching

#### 2. INVALID - Arguments For:
- **Undocumented feature**: The `use_caching` parameter is not documented in Django's public API documentation
- **Internal implementation detail**: Could be argued that this is an internal optimization not meant for public use
- **WeakKeyDictionary behavior is correct**: The WeakKeyDictionary is behaving as designed by Python

#### 3. WONTFIX - Arguments For:
- **Obscure feature**: Since it's undocumented, very few users would encounter this
- **Workaround exists**: Users can simply use `use_caching=False` (the default)
- **Performance optimization**: The caching feature might be intentionally limited to certain use cases

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments For:
- **Missing documentation**: The parameter exists in the constructor but is completely undocumented
- **Behavior should be documented**: If the limitation is intentional, it should be documented
- **API ambiguity**: The parameter is exposed in the public constructor, making it quasi-public

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments For:
- **Enhancement needed**: Supporting all sender types with caching could be seen as a new feature
- **Not originally designed for this**: The use of WeakKeyDictionary suggests it was designed only for garbage-collectable objects

### Analysis Summary

The core issue is that `use_caching=True` creates a WeakKeyDictionary that cannot handle non-weakly-referenceable types like strings. This is a real limitation that causes crashes with common Django usage patterns.

Key factors:
1. The parameter is in the public constructor signature (even if undocumented)
2. The failure mode is unintuitive (works at connect time, fails at send time)
3. Common Django patterns use string senders
4. The fix is straightforward (use regular dict instead of WeakKeyDictionary)

### Recommendation

This should be categorized as **BUG** because:

1. **Public API**: Despite being undocumented, the parameter is exposed in the public constructor, making it part of the de facto public API
2. **Reasonable expectations violated**: Users reasonably expect that all sender types that work in non-caching mode should work in caching mode
3. **Silent failure pattern**: The code appears to work (connect succeeds) but fails later (send fails), which is a dangerous pattern
4. **Common use case**: String senders are extremely common in Django applications
5. **Easy fix available**: The proposed fix (using a regular dict) would resolve the issue without breaking existing functionality

The fact that it's undocumented doesn't make it INVALID because the parameter is publicly exposed and discoverable through IDE autocomplete, help(), and source inspection. It's not a DOCUMENTATION_FIX because the code itself is broken for a reasonable use case. It's not WONTFIX because it affects a common pattern and has an easy fix.
