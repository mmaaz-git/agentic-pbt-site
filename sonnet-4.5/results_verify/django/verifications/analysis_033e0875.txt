## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation does not explicitly specify how `get_exception_info` should handle whitespace in template sources. The function's docstring only states it should "format exception information for display" without defining the exact formatting rules. One could argue that stripping whitespace is a valid formatting choice for display purposes, and the function is working as designed.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug causes actual errors (IndexError) and incorrect information display. When Jinja2 reports "error at line 3", developers expect to see the content of line 3 from their original template, not from a modified version. The function fails its stated purpose of helping developers debug templates when it shows the wrong line.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case that only occurs with templates containing leading newlines, which might be considered poor template formatting practice. The impact is limited to debug output, not production functionality. Developers can work around it by not having leading newlines in templates.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug can cause crashes (IndexError) in addition to showing wrong information. It affects a core debugging feature that developers rely on. Templates with leading whitespace are not uncommon, especially in generated or included templates. The fix is trivial and has no apparent downsides.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior of stripping whitespace could be documented as intended behavior, warning developers that line numbers in error messages refer to the stripped source, not the original. This would set correct expectations without changing the code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior contradicts the intuitive expectation that line numbers refer to the original source. Documenting counterintuitive behavior is inferior to fixing it. The function already references line numbers from Jinja2, which are based on the original source, so the mismatch is inherently problematic.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that preserving original line numbers is a new feature rather than a bug fix. The current implementation might have intentionally stripped whitespace for cleaner display, and preserving whitespace would be an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities. The function already attempts to show the line at the reported line number; it just does so incorrectly. Showing the correct line is not a new feature but a correction of existing functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function demonstrably fails its stated purpose. When Jinja2 reports an error at line N, `get_exception_info` should display the content of line N from the original template. Instead, it either crashes with IndexError or displays the wrong line. This misleads developers during debugging, which is the opposite of the function's intended purpose. The issue is reproducible, has a clear cause, and a simple fix.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that line numbers will correspond to the original source. The stripping behavior might have been intentional for display purposes. The function works correctly for templates without leading whitespace, which could be considered the expected input format.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report describes a genuine issue in Django's `get_exception_info` function. The function's purpose is to help developers debug template errors by showing them the problematic line. When it shows the wrong line or crashes, it fails this fundamental purpose.

The key evidence supporting this as a valid bug includes: (1) IndexError crashes when accessing lines that don't exist after stripping, (2) Incorrect line content displayed when the error line does exist but at a different position, and (3) The mismatch between Jinja2's line numbering (based on original source) and Django's display (based on stripped source).

While the documentation doesn't explicitly specify whitespace handling, the function's behavior violates the reasonable expectation that error messages should accurately identify the problematic code. The proposed fix is minimal, risk-free, and aligns the implementation with intuitive behavior. This is a clear case of a bug that should be fixed rather than documented or dismissed as an edge case.
