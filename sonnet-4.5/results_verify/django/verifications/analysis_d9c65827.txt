## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Why it should be BUG:**
- The cache violates its core invariant: MAX_ENTRIES is exceeded
- The documentation clearly states MAX_ENTRIES is "the maximum number of entries allowed"
- The bug can lead to unbounded memory growth in production systems
- The issue occurs with valid configuration values (CULL_FREQUENCY=3, MAX_ENTRIES=1)
- The fix is straightforward and maintains backward compatibility

**Against BUG:**
- Only occurs with unusual configurations where CULL_FREQUENCY > MAX_ENTRIES
- Most production systems use default values (MAX_ENTRIES=300, CULL_FREQUENCY=3) where this doesn't occur

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The edge case (CULL_FREQUENCY > MAX_ENTRIES) is arguably a misconfiguration
- Very few users would set MAX_ENTRIES to such small values in production
- The impact is minimal in typical use cases

**Against WONTFIX:**
- The bug violates a documented invariant
- Even edge cases should respect the contract
- The fix is simple and has no performance impact

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue that setting CULL_FREQUENCY > MAX_ENTRIES is user error

**Against INVALID:**
- Django accepts these values without warning
- The documentation doesn't prohibit this configuration
- The bug causes actual incorrect behavior (exceeding MAX_ENTRIES)

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could document that CULL_FREQUENCY should be <= MAX_ENTRIES

**Against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- MAX_ENTRIES clearly means "maximum entries"
- Documenting the bug doesn't fix the violation of the invariant

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be reframed as "Add validation for CULL_FREQUENCY vs MAX_ENTRIES"

**Against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The current behavior violates the existing contract

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation fails to enforce a documented invariant (MAX_ENTRIES as a maximum limit). While the configuration that triggers it may be unusual, the bug:
1. Violates explicit documentation
2. Can cause memory issues
3. Has a simple, safe fix
4. Represents incorrect logic in the culling algorithm

The suggested fix (ensuring at least 1 item is culled when at capacity) is reasonable and maintains the MAX_ENTRIES constraint without breaking existing functionality.
