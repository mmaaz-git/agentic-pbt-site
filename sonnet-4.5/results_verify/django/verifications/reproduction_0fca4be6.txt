# Reproduction Analysis

## Bug Report Summary
The bug report claims that `CheckMessage.__eq__` violates the symmetry property of equality when comparing parent class instances with subclass instances. Specifically, it claims that `CheckMessage(ERROR, msg) == Error(msg)` returns `True`, but `Error(msg) == CheckMessage(ERROR, msg)` returns `False`.

## Reproduction Results
I attempted to reproduce this bug using Django version 5.2.6 and found that **the bug does NOT reproduce as described**.

### Test 1: Direct Reproduction
```python
from django.core.checks import CheckMessage, Error, ERROR

parent = CheckMessage(ERROR, 'Test message')
child = Error('Test message')

print('parent == child:', parent == child)  # Output: False
print('child == parent:', child == parent)  # Output: False
```

Both comparisons return `False`, maintaining symmetry (False == False).

### Test 2: Hypothesis Test
The property-based test provided in the bug report:
```python
@given(st.text())
def test_checkmessage_equality_symmetry_with_subclass(msg):
    parent = CheckMessage(ERROR, msg)
    child = Error(msg)
    assert (parent == child) == (child == parent)
```
This test **PASSES** without any assertion errors, confirming that equality is symmetric.

## Analysis of the Implementation
Looking at the Django source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/checks/messages.py`, line 20-23:

```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    return isinstance(other, self.__class__) and all(
        getattr(self, attr) == getattr(other, attr)
        for attr in ["level", "msg", "hint", "obj", "id"]
    )
```

The implementation uses `isinstance(other, self.__class__)`. While this could theoretically cause asymmetry issues, in practice it doesn't because:

1. Python's comparison protocol calls the subclass's `__eq__` method first when comparing parent and child instances
2. When `Error.__eq__` is called (which inherits from `CheckMessage.__eq__`), `self.__class__` is `Error`
3. Since `isinstance(CheckMessage_instance, Error)` is `False`, both comparisons return `False`
4. This maintains symmetry: `False == False`

## Conclusion
The bug as described does not exist in Django 5.2.6. The equality comparison is symmetric, though both directions return `False` rather than `True`. The current behavior is:
- `CheckMessage(ERROR, msg) == Error(msg)` returns `False`
- `Error(msg) == CheckMessage(ERROR, msg)` returns `False`
- Symmetry is preserved: `False == False`

The bug report's claim that one comparison returns `True` while the other returns `False` could not be reproduced.
