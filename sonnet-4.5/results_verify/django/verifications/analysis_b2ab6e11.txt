## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation explicitly promises a ValueError for incorrect dot counts
- The current error messages ("too many values to unpack" and "not enough values to unpack") are implementation details that leak through
- The error messages don't help developers understand the actual requirement
- This is not a case of "raising exceptions that are not as useful as possible" - the docstring specifically promises a ValueError for this exact scenario

**Arguments For:**
- Technically, a ValueError IS raised as promised
- The documentation doesn't specify what the error message should say

**Verdict:** Not INVALID - the error message quality matters for developer experience

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - any developer using get_model() incorrectly will hit this
- The fix is trivial (3-4 lines of code)
- Poor error messages significantly impact developer experience
- Django is known for its helpful error messages

**Arguments For:**
- The error is technically correct (ValueError is raised)
- Developers can figure out the issue from the stack trace

**Verdict:** Not WONTFIX - this affects common usage and has a simple fix

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation is correct - it does raise ValueError
- The code behavior matches what's documented (ValueError for wrong dot count)
- Changing docs to say "raises a generic unpacking error" would be worse

**Arguments For:**
- The documentation could be more specific about the error message

**Verdict:** Not DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the docs are correct, the implementation needs improvement

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments Against:**
- This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new features
- The docstring already implies this should work properly
- Better error messages are bug fixes, not features

**Arguments For:**
- Could be seen as "enhancing" error messages
- The basic functionality (raising ValueError) works

**Verdict:** Could be FEATURE_REQUEST but more accurately a BUG

### Considering BUG
**Arguments For:**
- The error message violates the principle of least surprise
- Django prides itself on helpful error messages
- The docstring specifically mentions this error case, implying it should be handled properly
- The fix is simple and improves developer experience
- The current implementation exposes Python internals instead of domain-specific errors
- This is a contract violation in spirit if not in letter

**Arguments Against:**
- Technically the contract (raise ValueError) is met

**Verdict:** This is a BUG

### Final Analysis

This is a clear case of poor error messaging that violates Django's philosophy of helpful developer experience. While technically a ValueError is raised as documented, the error message "too many values to unpack (expected 2)" or "not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" provides no useful information about what the developer did wrong.

The docstring specifically calls out this error case, which implies Django considers it important enough to document. The implementation should provide a clear error message like "app_label must contain exactly one dot, got 'A.A.A'" instead of exposing Python's unpacking mechanics.

The bug report is valid, well-documented, includes a working test case, and proposes a reasonable fix. This should be categorized as BUG.
