## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully ran both the bug report's reproduction code and the Hypothesis property-based tests. The bug is confirmed to exist.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Basic Test Case** (text='hello', length=10, fill_text=''):
   - LPAD result: 'hello' (length 5 instead of expected 10)
   - RPAD result: 'hello' (length 5 instead of expected 10)
   - ❌ Both functions violate the length invariant

2. **Edge Case - Text Longer Than Target**:
   - When text is longer than target length with empty padding
   - Both LPAD and RPAD correctly truncate to target length
   - This case works as expected

3. **NULL Padding Test**:
   - Both functions correctly return None when fill_text is None
   - This aligns with SQL standard behavior for NULL inputs

4. **Normal Padding Test**:
   - With non-empty padding strings, functions work correctly
   - LPAD('hi', 5, 'x') → 'xxxhi' (correct length 5)
   - RPAD('hi', 5, 'y') → 'hiyyy' (correct length 5)

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based tests from the bug report failed as claimed:
- LPAD test failed with example: text='hello', length=10
- RPAD test failed with example: text='hello', length=10

### Technical Analysis of the Bug

The current implementation has a logical flaw in lines 389-395 (_sqlite_lpad) and 438-441 (_sqlite_rpad):

```python
def _sqlite_lpad(text, length, fill_text):
    if text is None or length is None or fill_text is None:
        return None
    delta = length - len(text)
    if delta <= 0:
        return text[:length]
    return (fill_text * length)[:delta] + text  # When fill_text="", this becomes "" + text
```

When `fill_text=""`:
1. `(fill_text * length)` produces an empty string ""
2. `""[:delta]` is still ""
3. `"" + text` just returns the original text
4. Result has wrong length when len(text) < length

The same issue exists in _sqlite_rpad.

### Impact Assessment
This is a real bug that:
1. Violates the fundamental invariant of LPAD/RPAD functions (exact length output)
2. Deviates from standard SQL behavior (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL return NULL)
3. Could cause data integrity issues in applications expecting fixed-width strings
4. Creates inconsistency between Django's SQLite backend and other database backends
