## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The functions are internal utilities not part of Django's public API
- The current behavior (raising exceptions) is actually the intended design, as evidenced by SQLite backend's usage which explicitly catches TypeError and ValueError
- The error message complaint (TypeError vs ValueError) falls under "Raising exceptions that are not as useful or descriptive as possible" which is listed as a common INVALID case
- These functions were never documented to handle malformed input gracefully

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The error messages are genuinely confusing and expose implementation details
- There's an inconsistency: empty strings return None but malformed strings raise exceptions

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- These are internal functions that users shouldn't be calling directly
- The SQLite backend already handles the exceptions properly, showing the system works as designed
- The specific error type (TypeError vs ValueError) is an internal implementation detail that doesn't affect functionality
- This falls under "Internal code that returns None instead of raising Exception/Error" inverse case - here it's raising exceptions which is fine for internal code
- Malformed date strings like '0' or '2024' would never occur in real database operations

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The functions are technically accessible and could be used by third-party database backends
- Better error messages would improve debugging experience

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The functions lack any documentation about expected input format
- The behavior (raising TypeError for malformed input) is reasonable but undocumented
- Adding docstrings explaining the expected format and exception behavior would clarify usage

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- These are internal functions not meant to be documented publicly
- The code comments already indicate their basic purpose

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The bug report essentially requests better error messages, which is listed as a common FEATURE_REQUEST case
- Could be viewed as requesting additional input validation
- The proposed fix adds new validation logic rather than fixing broken functionality

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The report frames this as a bug (functions "crash") not a feature request
- The inconsistency between empty string handling and malformed string handling could be seen as a bug

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments for BUG:**
- There is a genuine inconsistency: empty strings return None gracefully, but malformed strings crash
- The error messages are misleading (TypeError about missing 'month' argument doesn't clearly indicate the input format is wrong)
- The functions don't validate input before attempting operations that can fail

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The current behavior matches the usage pattern in Django's own codebase
- These are internal functions where exception-raising is acceptable
- The calling code is expected to handle exceptions

### Final Assessment

This issue falls into a gray area between WONTFIX and INVALID. The key factors are:

1. **Internal vs Public API**: These are internal utility functions, not public API
2. **Existing Usage Pattern**: Django's own SQLite backend demonstrates the expected usage - wrap calls in try/except
3. **Error Message Quality**: The complaint about confusing error messages fits the INVALID criterion of "Raising exceptions that are not as useful or descriptive as possible"
4. **Real-world Impact**: Malformed date strings like '0' or '2024' would not occur in actual database operations

The most appropriate categorization is **INVALID** because:
- The functions work as designed for their intended use case (converting database strings)
- The error message quality complaint falls under a specifically listed INVALID criterion
- These are internal functions where the current exception-raising behavior is intentional and properly handled by calling code
- The "bug" only manifests when using these internal functions incorrectly with invalid input that would never occur in real database operations
