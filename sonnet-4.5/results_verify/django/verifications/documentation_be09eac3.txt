DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Found:
-------------------

1. Function Docstring (django/templatetags/i18n.py):
   The get_language_info method has a comment but no docstring:
   ```python
   def get_language_info(self, language):
       # ``language`` is either a language code string or a sequence
       # with the language code as its first item
   ```

2. Template Tag Documentation (do_get_language_info_list):
   The parent template tag has this documentation:
   """
   Store a list of language information dictionaries for the given language
   codes in a context variable. The language codes can be specified either as
   a list of strings or a settings.LANGUAGES style list (or any sequence of
   sequences whose first items are language codes).
   """

3. Translation Module (django.utils.translation.get_language_info):
   The underlying function that gets called expects a lang_code string and raises:
   - KeyError("Unknown language code %s." % lang_code) for invalid codes
   - It does NOT document handling of empty strings

Key Observations:
----------------

1. The documentation states the function accepts "a list of strings or a settings.LANGUAGES style list" but does NOT specify:
   - Whether empty strings are valid
   - Whether empty lists/tuples are valid
   - What happens with invalid inputs

2. The comment says "language is either a language code string or a sequence with the language code as its first item"
   - This implies sequences should have at least one item
   - But doesn't explicitly state this requirement

3. The underlying translation.get_language_info() function:
   - Expects a non-empty string
   - Raises KeyError with message "Unknown language code X." for invalid codes
   - When passed empty string, raises: KeyError: 'Unknown language code .'

Documentation Gap:
-----------------
The documentation does not explicitly state that:
- Empty strings are invalid
- Empty sequences are invalid
- What type of error should be raised for these cases

However, the current IndexError is clearly unintended as:
1. It's a low-level error that doesn't indicate the actual problem
2. The code comment implies it should handle both strings and sequences
3. The underlying function has proper error handling with KeyError
