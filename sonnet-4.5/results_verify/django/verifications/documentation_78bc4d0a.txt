Documentation Analysis
======================

Django Documentation Review:
----------------------------
The official Django documentation for NthValue states:
- The function "computes the row relative to the offset nth (must be a positive value) within the window"
- The nth parameter "must be a positive value" and defaults to 1
- Returns None if no row exists at the specified position

The documentation clearly specifies that nth must be positive, which aligns with the validation logic in the code.

Error Message Patterns in Django:
---------------------------------
1. NthValue class (line 85): "requires a positive integer as for nth"
2. LagLeadFunction class (line 47): "requires a positive integer for the offset"
3. Both classes validate for positive integers similarly

The inconsistency is internal to Django's codebase. The LagLeadFunction uses grammatically correct phrasing ("for the offset"), while NthValue uses the incorrect "as for nth" construction.

Documentation Coverage:
----------------------
The documentation does not specify the exact wording of error messages, which is standard practice. Error message text is typically considered an implementation detail. However, error messages should still be grammatically correct and clear to users.

Conclusion:
The documentation supports the requirement that nth must be positive, and the validation logic is correct. The issue is purely with the grammar of the error message text itself, not with the functionality or documented behavior of the function.
