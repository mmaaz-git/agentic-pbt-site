## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Backend Inconsistency**: Two implementations of the same storage interface (FileSystemStorage and InMemoryStorage) behave differently for the same operation - opening text files with non-LF line endings.

2. **Data Corruption**: FileSystemStorage silently modifies file content during round-trip operations (save then open), violating the fundamental expectation that storage systems preserve data.

3. **Real-World Impact**: Applications that depend on specific line endings (Windows CRLF files, configuration files, checksums) will fail when using FileSystemStorage but work with InMemoryStorage.

4. **Violation of Least Surprise**: Developers expect storage.open() to return the same content that was saved, not a modified version.

5. **Easy Fix Available**: The bug report provides a simple, correct fix using Python's newline='' parameter.

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. **Historical Behavior**: FileSystemStorage may have always behaved this way, and changing it could break existing applications that depend on line ending normalization.

2. **Python Default**: FileSystemStorage is simply using Python's default open() behavior, which could be considered acceptable.

3. **Workaround Available**: Users can open files in binary mode if they need to preserve exact line endings.

**Counter-arguments:**
- The inconsistency between backends is more problematic than any historical behavior
- Silent data modification is generally unacceptable for storage systems

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. **Undocumented Behavior**: Django's documentation doesn't explicitly promise that storage backends will preserve line endings in text mode.

2. **Implementation Freedom**: Storage backends might be allowed to have different behaviors as long as they implement the required interface.

**Counter-arguments:**
- The lack of documentation doesn't excuse inconsistent behavior between backends
- Storage systems have an implicit contract to preserve data

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be a FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. **New Capability**: If line ending preservation in text mode was never a design goal, adding it would be a new feature.

2. **Configuration Option**: Could be reimplemented as a configurable behavior for FileSystemStorage.

**Counter-arguments:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The storage already works correctly in binary mode, so preservation is expected

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. **Unclear Expectations**: The documentation doesn't specify how storage backends should handle line endings.

2. **Working as Designed**: If the current behavior is intentional, the documentation should explain the difference.

**Counter-arguments:**
- The behavior is objectively incorrect (data corruption)
- Documentation alone won't fix the backend inconsistency

### Final Assessment

This is most clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Storage systems should not silently modify data. When you save content and then retrieve it, you expect to get back what you saved.

2. **Backend Substitutability**: Django's storage backends are designed to be swappable. Having different behaviors for the same operation breaks this design principle.

3. **Silent Data Corruption**: The modification happens silently without any warning, which can lead to hard-to-debug issues in production.

4. **Clear Fix**: The solution is straightforward and aligns both backends to preserve content.

5. **No Reasonable Use Case for Current Behavior**: There's no compelling reason why FileSystemStorage should normalize line endings while InMemoryStorage doesn't. If line ending normalization was desired, it should be consistent across all backends and documented.

The bug is well-documented, reproducible, affects real-world use cases, and has a clear fix that maintains backward compatibility for binary mode while fixing the text mode inconsistency.
