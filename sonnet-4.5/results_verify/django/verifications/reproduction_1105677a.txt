BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. TEST REPRODUCTION
The provided Hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue. Running the test with examples "my2app", "app2api", and "test1module" all fail with the assertion error that letters after digits are unexpectedly capitalized.

2. MANUAL REPRODUCTION
The manual reproduction code confirms the behavior:
- Input "my2app" becomes "My2App" instead of expected "My2app"
- Input "test1module" becomes "Test1Module" instead of "Test1module"
- Input "app2api" becomes "App2Api" instead of "App2api"
- Input "my_2_app" becomes "My2App" (underscores removed as expected)

3. ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION
I verified in the Django source code at:
/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/management/templates.py:138

The line uses: `"".join(x for x in name.title() if x != "_")`

Python's .title() method treats digits as word boundaries, capitalizing the letter following any digit. This is standard Python behavior - "my2app".title() returns "My2App".

4. IMPACT
The camel_case_app_name variable is used in Django's app template to generate the AppConfig class name. For example, when creating an app named "my2app", it generates:
```python
class My2AppConfig(AppConfig):
```
Instead of the more intuitive:
```python
class My2appConfig(AppConfig):
```

This affects any Django app or project names containing digits, producing class names with unexpected capitalization patterns that don't match typical Python naming conventions for identifiers containing digits.
