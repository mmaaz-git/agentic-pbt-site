## Documentation Analysis for Apps.get_model()

### Source Code Documentation

I examined the actual source code docstring in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/apps/registry.py` (lines 189-199):

```python
def get_model(self, app_label, model_name=None, require_ready=True):
    """
    Return the model matching the given app_label and model_name.

    As a shortcut, app_label may be in the form <app_label>.<model_name>.

    model_name is case-insensitive.

    Raise LookupError if no application exists with this label, or no
    model exists with this name in the application. Raise ValueError if
    called with a single argument that doesn't contain exactly one dot.
    """
```

The docstring explicitly states that the method should:
1. Accept a shortcut form where `app_label` can be in the format "<app_label>.<model_name>"
2. **Raise ValueError if called with a single argument that doesn't contain exactly one dot**

### Django Official Documentation

The Django documentation confirms this behavior, stating that `get_model()` will raise a `ValueError` "when called with a single argument that doesn't contain exactly one dot."

### Contract Analysis

The documentation establishes a clear contract:
- When `model_name` is None (single argument mode), the `app_label` parameter MUST contain exactly one dot
- If it doesn't contain exactly one dot, a **ValueError** should be raised
- The documentation implies this ValueError should be descriptive about the dot requirement

### Current Implementation vs. Documentation

The current implementation (line 206) does:
```python
app_label, model_name = app_label.split(".")
```

This implementation:
1. Does raise a ValueError (meeting the basic requirement)
2. But the error message is generic Python unpacking error, not a descriptive message about the dot requirement
3. The error doesn't help users understand what they did wrong

### Conclusion

The documentation promises a ValueError for incorrect dot counts, which technically happens. However, the spirit of the documentation implies a helpful error message that explains the requirement, not a generic Python unpacking error. The current implementation violates the principle of providing clear, actionable error messages to developers.
