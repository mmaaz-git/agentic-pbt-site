BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

## Test Execution Summary

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report. Here are the key findings:

### 1. Basic Reproduction Test
When a check function returns the string "error message":
- Expected: A list of CheckMessage objects or an error
- Actual: ['e', 'r', 'r', 'o', 'r', ' ', 'm', 'e', 's', 's', 'a', 'g', 'e']
- The string was split character-by-character into a list

### 2. Property-Based Test
The Hypothesis test from the bug report passed, confirming that for ANY non-empty string input, the CheckRegistry will:
- Accept the string without raising an error
- Split it character-by-character
- Return a list containing each character as a separate element

### 3. Empty String Behavior
When returning an empty string "", the result is an empty list [], which is technically correct but for the wrong reason.

### 4. Other Iterable Types
The code also accepts and processes:
- Tuples: Converted to list, elements preserved
- Generators: Consumed and converted to list
- Sets: Converted to list (order may vary)

All of these pass through without error, even though the documentation says "must return a list".

### 5. Correct Usage
When properly returning a list of CheckMessage objects (Error, Warning, etc.), the system works as intended.

## Technical Impact

The bug has real consequences:
1. **Silent Failure**: A developer accidentally returning a string gets no error at check registration time
2. **Confusing Output**: The resulting list of characters will cause downstream errors when code expects CheckMessage objects
3. **Type Safety Violation**: The documented contract (list of CheckMessage objects) is not enforced

## Verification

The bug is 100% reproducible and matches the report exactly. The code behaves precisely as the bug report describes - strings are accepted as valid iterables and processed character-by-character instead of being rejected.
