## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. The code violates Python's fundamental rule about not modifying dictionaries during iteration
2. It causes a `RuntimeError` which crashes the application
3. Even when it doesn't crash, it fails to remove all underscore headers as intended
4. The security feature (removing all underscore headers) is broken, potentially allowing header spoofing attacks
5. The fix is straightforward and well-established in Python best practices
6. This affects a security-critical component that Django, Nginx, and Apache all implement correctly

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- (No valid reasons - this is clearly incorrect behavior)

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- (Not applicable - the bug is real, reproducible, and violates both Python rules and Django's documented behavior)

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. Could argue that this only affects the development server (`runserver`) not production deployments
2. Might claim that production servers (Nginx/Apache) already strip these headers

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
1. The bug affects security functionality - incomplete header removal is a security vulnerability
2. The development server should behave correctly even if production servers provide defense-in-depth
3. The fix is trivial and has no downsides
4. Django's own comment states this is a security feature that should work

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- (Not applicable - the documentation correctly describes the intended behavior; the code is wrong)

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- (Not applicable - this is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features)

## Final Assessment

This is unequivocally a **BUG** that should be fixed:

1. **Clear Python violation**: Modifying a dictionary during iteration is a well-documented Python error
2. **Security impact**: The bug defeats a security measure designed to prevent header spoofing
3. **Inconsistent behavior**: Sometimes crashes with RuntimeError, sometimes silently fails to remove all headers
4. **Trivial fix**: The solution is standard Python practice - iterate over a copy or collected keys
5. **High severity**: Security features must work reliably, especially those preventing known attack vectors (CVE-2015-0219)

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, includes a working reproduction, and proposes the correct fix. This is a textbook example of a valid bug report that should be addressed immediately.
