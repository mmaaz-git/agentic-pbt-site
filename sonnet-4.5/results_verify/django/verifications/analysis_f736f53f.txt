## Bug Report Analysis for django.utils.translation.to_locale

### Considerations for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function has clear inconsistent behavior: it lowercases the input on line 233 but then uses the original variable on line 235
- This is obviously a programming error - the lowercased `lang` variable is computed but never used
- The output 'gerMAN' from input 'GerMAN' is clearly not the intended behavior
- The function already attempts case normalization, so it should do it consistently
- RFC 5646 states language tags should be case-insensitive, implying normalization is appropriate
- The fix is trivial and obvious: use `lang` instead of `language[:3].lower() + language[3:]`

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The input 'GerMAN' is not a valid language code anyway
- Real-world usage would likely never encounter this issue

#### INVALID (Incorrect report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function's documentation doesn't specify how it handles non-standard inputs
- 'GerMAN' is not a valid ISO 639 language code, so behavior is undefined
- The function might intentionally preserve some original casing for unknown codes

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code clearly shows this is a bug - `lang` is computed but unused
- The function already tries to normalize case, just inconsistently
- Even for invalid inputs, consistent behavior is better than inconsistent

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The bug only affects invalid language codes like 'GerMAN'
- Real language codes are 2-3 lowercase letters, so this would never happen in practice
- No actual Django user would encounter this issue
- The impact is minimal - just cosmetic inconsistency

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (one-line change)
- Code correctness matters even for edge cases
- The bug represents sloppy code that should be fixed

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that proper validation/normalization of non-standard codes is a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function already attempts normalization, it's just broken
- This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Doc issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could clarify how non-standard inputs are handled

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is clearly wrong regardless of documentation
- The unused `lang` variable proves this is a coding error

### Analysis Summary

This is clearly a **BUG**. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. **Obvious coding error**: Line 233 computes `lang = language.lower().partition("-")[0]` but then line 235 ignores `lang` and uses the original `language` variable. This is a textbook example of a variable being computed but not used.

2. **Inconsistent normalization**: The function attempts to normalize case but does so inconsistently - only the first 3 characters are lowercased while the rest retain original casing.

3. **Standards compliance**: RFC 5646 indicates language tags should be case-insensitive, and the function already tries to normalize, just incorrectly.

4. **Simple fix**: The correction is trivial and obvious - use the already-computed `lang` variable.

While the bug may only affect non-standard inputs that wouldn't occur in real usage, it's still a legitimate coding error that should be fixed. The unused variable `lang` is clear evidence this was unintentional.
