Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

The bug report claims there is a grammatical error in the error message of Django's NthValue class when validation fails for the nth parameter.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Examined the Django source code at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/db/models/functions/window.py
2. Confirmed the error message at line 85: "NthValue requires a positive integer as for nth."
3. Created and ran test scripts to reproduce the issue

Test Results:
- When NthValue is called with nth=0: ValueError raised with message "NthValue requires a positive integer as for nth."
- When NthValue is called with nth=-1: Same error message
- When NthValue is called with nth=None: Same error message

The error message consistently contains the grammatically incorrect phrase "as for nth" instead of either:
- "for nth" (more concise)
- "as the nth parameter" (more explicit)
- "for the nth parameter" (alternative)

Comparison with Similar Code:
The LagLeadFunction class in the same file (line 47) uses the correct grammar: "requires a positive integer for the offset."

The bug is reproducible and the grammatical error "as for nth" is consistently present in the error message. The phrase appears to be a typo where "as" and "for" were accidentally combined, creating an ungrammatical construction.
