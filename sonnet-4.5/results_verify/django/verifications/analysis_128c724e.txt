TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Analyzing this bug report against the five possible outcomes:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
--------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The function does remove content (U+001C/1D/1E characters disappear)
- The docstring says "preserve all white space" which could include these chars
- Data loss occurs - these are legitimate ASCII control characters
- The behavior may surprise users who use these as data separators

Arguments AGAINST:
- The docstring says "preserve all white space EXCEPT added line breaks"
- These characters ARE line breaks according to Python's splitlines()
- The function is behaving consistently with Python's standard library
- The bug report contains a factual error (claims these aren't whitespace when they are)

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
---------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The bug report incorrectly claims U+001C/1D/1E are "NOT whitespace" when Python officially considers them whitespace (isspace() returns True)
- The function behaves as documented: it preserves whitespace "except added line breaks"
- These characters are documented line separators in Python's splitlines()
- The function is using Python's standard library correctly

Arguments AGAINST:
- Content is indeed being removed/transformed
- The behavior could be considered surprising
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state these control characters will be removed

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
-----------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- These are obscure ASCII control characters rarely used in modern applications
- U+001C/1D/1E are from the 1960s era of computing
- Very few users would encounter this in practice
- The function is primarily for text wrapping, not data processing

Arguments AGAINST:
- Data loss is generally not trivial
- Some legacy systems and data formats do use these separators

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
---------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Adding an option to preserve these characters would be a new feature
- The function never claimed to preserve all Unicode characters unchanged
- Supporting legacy data separators could be seen as an enhancement

Arguments AGAINST:
- The bug report frames this as incorrect behavior, not a missing feature
- Content preservation is expected from a wrapping function

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
-------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The docstring could be clearer about which characters are preserved
- Should explicitly state that Python's line separators will be normalized
- The ambiguity about "whitespace except line breaks" needs clarification

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation is technically correct as written
- The function is not in the public API, so detailed documentation may not be needed

CONCLUSION
----------
The strongest case is for INVALID because:

1. The bug report contains a fundamental factual error - it claims U+001C/1D/1E are NOT whitespace, but Python officially considers them whitespace (isspace() returns True due to bidirectional class B).

2. The function behaves exactly as Python's standard library dictates - splitlines() treats these as line boundaries, and the wrap() function correctly processes them as such.

3. The docstring says "preserve all white space EXCEPT added line breaks" - these characters are both whitespace AND line breaks, so removing them is consistent with the documented behavior.

4. The function is using Python's splitlines() correctly and consistently.

However, there's a secondary case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX if we consider that the behavior, while correct, could be more clearly documented. The docstring could explicitly mention that Unicode line separators will be normalized to \n.
