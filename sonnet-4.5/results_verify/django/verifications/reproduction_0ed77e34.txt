BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

1. TEST CASE VERIFICATION:
The bug report's test case reproduces exactly as described:

```python
from django.db.migrations.serializer import DictionarySerializer
d = {0: 0, '': 0}
serializer = DictionarySerializer(d)
result, imports = serializer.serialize()
```

Result: TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'

2. ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:
The error occurs at line 129 of serializer.py:
```python
for k, v in sorted(self.value.items()):
```

When the dictionary has keys of different types (int 0 and str ''), Python 3's sorted() function cannot compare them directly, raising a TypeError.

3. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
The property-based test using Hypothesis confirmed the issue is systematic:
- Dictionaries with homogeneous keys (all int or all str) work fine
- ANY dictionary with mixed key types fails with TypeError
- The failure is 100% reproducible for mixed-type dictionaries

4. EXTENDED TESTING:
Tested various mixed-type combinations, ALL failed:
- {1: 'a', 'b': 2} - int and str keys: FAILS
- {1.5: 'x', 'y': 2} - float and str keys: FAILS
- {True: 1, 'false': 0} - bool and str keys: FAILS
- {None: 'none', 'null': None} - None and str keys: FAILS

5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
This is a complete failure - the serializer cannot handle ANY dictionary with mixed-type keys. The crash happens immediately upon calling serialize(), making it impossible to serialize such dictionaries for migrations.

6. PROPOSED FIX VALIDATION:
The bug report suggests using a key function that sorts by type name first, then value:
```python
sorted(self.value.items(), key=lambda x: (type(x[0]).__name__, x[0]))
```

This would group keys by type and sort within each type, providing deterministic ordering without type comparison errors. Testing shows this fix works correctly.

7. USE CASE VALIDITY:
Mixed-type dictionary keys are:
- Valid Python syntax
- Used in real-world code
- Could appear in Django model field defaults, choices, or other migration-serialized contexts
- Not explicitly prohibited by Django documentation
