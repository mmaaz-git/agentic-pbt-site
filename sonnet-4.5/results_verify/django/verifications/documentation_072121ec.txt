## Documentation Analysis for is_broken_pipe_error()

### Function Purpose
The `is_broken_pipe_error()` function is an internal Django utility function used in the development server (runserver) to identify and handle broken pipe errors gracefully. It checks if the current exception is one of the connection-related errors: BrokenPipeError, ConnectionAbortedError, or ConnectionResetError.

### Documentation Findings

1. **No Official API Documentation**: The function is not documented in Django's official API documentation. It's an internal implementation detail of the development server, not a public API.

2. **Python sys.exc_info() Documentation**: According to Python's official documentation:
   - `sys.exc_info()` returns a tuple of three values: (type, value, traceback)
   - When NO exception is being handled, it returns `(None, None, None)`
   - This is explicitly documented behavior in Python

3. **socketserver.handle_error() Documentation**: According to Python's socketserver documentation:
   - `handle_error()` is called when the `handle()` method raises an exception
   - As of Python 3.6, it's only called for exceptions derived from the `Exception` class
   - The documentation implies (but doesn't explicitly guarantee) that an exception context exists when this method is called

### Current Usage Context
The function is only used within `WSGIServer.handle_error()`:
- The parent class's `handle_error()` is designed to be called when an exception occurs during request handling
- In this context, there SHOULD always be an active exception
- The function serves to filter out common connection errors that don't need full error handling

### Documentation vs Implementation Gap
1. **Undocumented Internal Function**: Since this is an internal function without public documentation, there's no contract about its behavior when called outside an exception context.

2. **Implicit Assumption**: The implementation assumes it will only be called within an exception handler, but this assumption is:
   - Not documented
   - Not enforced in the code
   - Not validated with defensive programming

3. **Python Best Practice**: Python's documentation for `sys.exc_info()` clearly states it returns `(None, None, None)` when no exception is active. Any code using `sys.exc_info()` should handle this case.

### Conclusion
While the function is currently only called in a context where an exception should be active, the lack of defensive programming against the documented behavior of `sys.exc_info()` represents a code quality issue. The function makes an undocumented assumption that could lead to crashes if the function is ever:
- Called from a different context
- Refactored or reused
- Called due to a bug in the calling code
