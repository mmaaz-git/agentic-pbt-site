DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. DJANGO DOCUMENTATION
The Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/) mentions the camel_case_app_name variable in the context of startapp and startproject commands:
- It states that camel_case_app_name is "the app name in camel case format"
- No specific details are provided about HOW the conversion to camel case is performed
- No mention of how digits should be handled in app names
- No examples are given with app names containing digits

2. PYTHON DOCUMENTATION
Python's str.title() documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title):
- Describes title() as using "a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters"
- Does not explicitly state that digits act as word boundaries
- The documentation warns about unexpected behavior with apostrophes but not with digits
- Suggests string.capwords() or regex as alternatives for more control

3. UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
The behavior of camel case conversion for app names with digits is NOT explicitly defined in Django's documentation. The documentation neither:
- States that digits should act as word separators
- States that digits should NOT act as word separators
- Provides examples of the expected output for names with digits

4. NAMING CONVENTIONS
Django documentation doesn't provide explicit guidance on:
- Whether app names with digits are recommended or discouraged
- How such names should be converted to camel case
- What the expected class name format should be for apps with digits

5. CONCLUSION
The current behavior is technically consistent with Python's .title() method, but:
- It's not documented in Django's documentation
- It produces counterintuitive results for valid Python identifiers
- The documentation doesn't warn users about this behavior
- There's no specification about whether this is intended behavior or not
