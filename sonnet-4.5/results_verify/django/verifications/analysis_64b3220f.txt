## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation clearly states that success_url supports placeholders that will be interpolated against object attributes. When a developer uses a placeholder that doesn't exist in the object, this is a developer error - they've misconfigured their view. The KeyError accurately reflects that the requested key doesn't exist. Python's standard behavior for dictionary access with missing keys is to raise KeyError, and Django is following Python semantics here.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies that the code raises a KeyError when placeholders don't match object attributes. This is verifiable behavior that occurs consistently. The documentation mentions placeholder support but doesn't specify error handling, making this behavior undefined rather than explicitly correct. Other parts of Django handle similar configuration errors with ImproperlyConfigured exceptions.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case that only occurs when developers make configuration mistakes - using placeholder names that don't match their model attributes. The KeyError itself is descriptive enough to identify the problem (it shows which key is missing). Developers who encounter this error can quickly identify and fix their typo. The error only happens during development, not in production with properly configured views.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Django already has an established pattern of using ImproperlyConfigured for configuration errors in the same method (lines 125-128). The proposed fix is minimal (4 lines of code) and follows existing Django patterns. The improved error message would significantly help developers debug configuration issues. This affects a documented feature (placeholder support) that should have consistent error handling.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation mentions that placeholders are supported but doesn't specify what happens when they don't match. The current KeyError behavior could be considered the expected behavior that just needs to be documented. Adding a note to the documentation warning developers that placeholders must match object attributes exactly would clarify the expected behavior without requiring code changes.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code already has a pattern of raising ImproperlyConfigured for configuration issues in the same method. The documentation doesn't suggest that KeyError is the intended behavior for mismatched placeholders. Simply documenting the KeyError would be inconsistent with how Django handles similar configuration errors elsewhere in the same class.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Currently, Django provides basic placeholder support without validation. Adding error handling for mismatched placeholders could be seen as a new feature - placeholder validation. This would be an enhancement to make the framework more developer-friendly rather than fixing broken functionality. The current behavior (KeyError) technically works, and the proposed change adds new error checking.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality but asking for better error handling of existing functionality. Placeholder support already exists as a documented feature. The request is to handle errors consistently with established Django patterns (ImproperlyConfigured), not to add new capabilities. Error handling improvements are typically considered bug fixes, not features.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Django has an established pattern in this exact method of raising ImproperlyConfigured for configuration errors (see lines 125-128). The current KeyError provides no context about where the error occurred or that it's a configuration issue. The same method handles another configuration error case properly but fails to handle this one. The inconsistency in error handling within a single method suggests this is an oversight rather than intentional design.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
KeyError is Python's standard exception for missing dictionary keys, which accurately describes what's happening. The documentation doesn't promise any specific error handling for mismatched placeholders. Developers making configuration errors should expect to debug them. The error occurs during development when testing views, not in production, so the impact is minimal.

## Overall consideration

After analyzing all considerations, this appears to be a WONTFIX issue. While the bug report is technically accurate about the KeyError being raised, and there is an argument for consistency with the ImproperlyConfigured pattern used elsewhere in the same method, this falls into the category of improving error messages for developer mistakes rather than fixing broken functionality.

The KeyError that's currently raised is semantically correct - it accurately indicates that a dictionary key is missing. The error message ('user_id' or whatever the placeholder name is) immediately tells developers what attribute they're trying to access that doesn't exist. While wrapping this in ImproperlyConfigured would be slightly more consistent with Django's patterns, the current error is sufficient for developers to identify and fix their configuration mistake.

Most importantly, this only affects developers who make configuration errors during development. It's not a runtime issue that would affect end users. The cost-benefit of changing working code that raises a reasonable (if not ideal) error for configuration mistakes is low. This is the type of minor inconsistency that exists throughout many codebases and is typically closed as WONTFIX unless it causes significant developer confusion, which KeyError with the missing key name does not.
