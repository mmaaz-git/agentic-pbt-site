BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
OrderedSet is an undocumented internal Django utility class without any public API specification. The documentation never claims that OrderedSet should support equality comparison. Since there's no documented contract about how equality should work, and the class appears to be for internal Django use only, one could argue that expecting equality semantics is an invalid assumption. The class name simply indicates it's a set that preserves order, not that it implements all set operations.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The name "OrderedSet" strongly implies set-like behavior, and all Python collection types (list, set, dict, tuple) implement content-based equality. It's a reasonable expectation that a class called OrderedSet would compare based on contents, not identity. The fact that it implements other collection protocols (__len__, __contains__, __iter__) suggests it should also implement __eq__.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal Django utility that has worked fine for years without equality comparison. Django's own code doesn't appear to need this functionality. The class is not documented as a public API, so adding features to it provides minimal value. The current behavior (identity comparison) hasn't caused any reported issues in Django's actual usage.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
If Django exposes this class publicly (even without documentation), users will inevitably use it. Having a collection type that doesn't support basic equality comparison is a footgun. The fix is trivial (a few lines of code) and would make the class more complete and intuitive.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The class lacks any documentation about its comparison behavior. If the intent is that OrderedSet uses identity comparison, this should be documented. Adding a note that "OrderedSet does not implement content-based equality comparison" would clarify expectations.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
OrderedSet isn't publicly documented at all - it's an internal utility. There's no documentation to fix because the class isn't part of Django's public API. The lack of equality isn't a documentation bug; it's either a missing feature or working as intended.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
OrderedSet never promised equality comparison, and adding it would be a new feature. The class currently works for its intended purpose (maintaining insertion order in a set-like container). Adding __eq__ and __hash__ methods would be an enhancement, not a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Equality comparison is such a fundamental operation for collection types that its absence feels more like a bug than a missing feature. Every Python developer would expect a collection to support equality comparison. This is fixing an oversight, not adding new functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
A class named OrderedSet that doesn't support equality comparison violates the principle of least surprise. Python developers reasonably expect collection types to compare by content. The absence of __eq__ makes the class incomplete and potentially error-prone. Other similar classes (set, frozenset, list, dict) all implement equality.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There's no documentation claiming OrderedSet supports equality. The class works correctly for its documented purpose ("keeps the ordering of the inserted items"). Django's internal usage doesn't require equality comparison. Without a documented contract being violated, this is not technically a bug.

## Overall Consideration

This case sits on the boundary between INVALID, FEATURE_REQUEST, and WONTFIX. The key factors are:

1. **Lack of Documentation**: OrderedSet is not part of Django's documented public API. It appears in django.utils.datastructures but has no official documentation page. This suggests it's primarily for internal use, making user expectations about its behavior less relevant.

2. **Reasonable Expectations vs. Actual Contract**: While developers might reasonably expect equality comparison from something called "OrderedSet," there's no documented contract that promises this behavior. The class does exactly what its minimal docstring says: "keeps the ordering of the inserted items." Nothing more is promised.

3. **Impact and Usage**: Django's own code doesn't appear to need equality comparison for OrderedSet. The class has functioned adequately for its internal purposes without this feature. Adding equality comparison would be nice-to-have but isn't fixing any actual problem in Django's usage.

Given that this is an undocumented internal utility, that Django itself doesn't need this functionality, and that no contract is being violated, this should be treated as INVALID. The user is making assumptions about undocumented behavior of an internal class. While the expectation might seem reasonable, there's no obligation for Django to meet undocumented expectations for internal utilities.
