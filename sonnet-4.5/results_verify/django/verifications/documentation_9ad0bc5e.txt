DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR DJANGO OrderedSet
=============================================

1. DJANGO DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:
---------------------------------
- OrderedSet is located in django.utils.datastructures
- The class has a very minimal docstring: "A set which keeps the ordering of the inserted items."
- There is NO official Django documentation page for OrderedSet in the public API docs
- OrderedSet is primarily used internally by Django (e.g., in the test runner)
- The class is not documented in Django's official reference documentation

2. CLASS IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS:
---------------------------------
The OrderedSet implementation provides:
- __init__(iterable=None): Initialize from an iterable
- add(item): Add an item to the set
- remove(item): Remove an item (raises KeyError if not found)
- discard(item): Remove an item (no error if not found)
- __iter__: Iteration support
- __reversed__: Reverse iteration support
- __contains__: Membership testing (item in set)
- __bool__: Truthiness testing
- __len__: Length support
- __repr__: String representation

Notably MISSING:
- __eq__: Equality comparison
- __hash__: Hashing support (surprisingly it IS hashable due to default object hash)
- __ne__: Not-equal comparison
- No set operations (union, intersection, difference, etc.)

3. PYTHON SET BEHAVIOR REFERENCE:
---------------------------------
Python's built-in set class DOES implement:
- __eq__: Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements (order doesn't matter for sets)
- __hash__: Sets are unhashable (mutable)
- Standard set includes: empty set() == set() returns True

4. DOCUMENTATION IMPLICATIONS:
-----------------------------
- OrderedSet is NOT explicitly documented as a public API
- There are NO documented expectations about equality behavior
- The docstring only mentions "keeps the ordering" - nothing about comparison
- As an internal utility class, its behavior is not contractually specified
- The name "OrderedSet" suggests set-like behavior but with order preservation
- Without documentation specifying equality semantics, users must rely on intuition

5. USAGE IN DJANGO:
------------------
- Used internally in django.test.runner for organizing test collections
- Used as a defaultdict value type to group tests while preserving order
- No evidence of equality comparisons being used in Django's own code

CONCLUSION:
-----------
There is NO documentation that specifies how OrderedSet equality should work. The class appears to be an internal Django utility without a documented public API contract. The behavior of equality comparison is therefore UNSPECIFIED.
