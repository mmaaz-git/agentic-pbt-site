DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR DJANGO LOCALE BIDI SETTINGS

1. LANG_INFO Documentation
---------------------------
The Django source code at django/conf/locale/__init__.py contains a docstring that describes LANG_INFO as:
"LANG_INFO is a dictionary structure to provide meta information about languages."

The only guidance about the bidi field comes from observing the data structure itself - it's a boolean field that appears to indicate whether a language uses bidirectional (right-to-left) text.

2. Purpose of the bidi Flag
---------------------------
Based on Django's internationalization documentation and code review:
- The 'bidi' flag is used to indicate languages that require right-to-left (RTL) text rendering
- This affects template rendering where {% get_current_language_bidi %} can be used to apply RTL styles
- It impacts CSS direction and text-align properties in user interfaces

3. No Explicit Documentation on Criteria
-----------------------------------------
There is NO explicit documentation found that defines:
- What criteria should be used to determine if a language should have bidi=True
- Whether the decision is based on script, historical usage, or current writing system
- Any special cases or exceptions to the general rule

4. Observed Pattern in LANG_INFO
---------------------------------
From examining the current LANG_INFO dictionary:
- 8 languages are marked with bidi=True
- 7 of these (Arabic, Algerian Arabic, Central Kurdish, Persian, Hebrew, Uyghur, Urdu) use scripts that are inherently RTL (Arabic or Hebrew scripts)
- 1 language (Azerbaijani) is marked as bidi=True but uses Latin script in its name_local field

5. Template Usage Documentation
--------------------------------
Django templates use the bidi flag to:
- Set the HTML dir="rtl" attribute
- Apply appropriate CSS styles for RTL languages
- Control text alignment and layout direction

6. No Documentation on Historical Considerations
------------------------------------------------
The documentation does not specify whether languages should be marked as bidi based on:
- Historical writing systems (e.g., Azerbaijani's past use of Arabic script)
- Current official writing systems
- The actual script used in the name_local field

CONCLUSION: The documentation does not explicitly define what makes a language "bidi". The implicit understanding from code patterns is that bidi=True should be used for languages that currently use right-to-left scripts. There is no documented reason why Azerbaijani, which currently uses Latin script (left-to-right), should be marked as bidi=True.
