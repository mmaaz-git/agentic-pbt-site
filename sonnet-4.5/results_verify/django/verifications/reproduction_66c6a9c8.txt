## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for `django.utils.http.quote_etag`. The function violates idempotence when given input strings containing quote characters.

### Reproduction Steps Performed

1. **Hypothesis Test Execution**
   - Ran the property-based test with hypothesis
   - The test immediately found the failing case with input `'"'` (single quote character)
   - Confirmed that `quote_etag('"')` returns `'"""'`
   - And `quote_etag('"""')` returns `'"""""'`
   - These are not equal, violating idempotence

2. **Manual Test Case Verification**
   - Tested the specific failing input `'"'`
   - Result: `quote_etag('"') = '"""'`
   - Result: `quote_etag('"""') = '"""""'`
   - Confirmed the assertion failure

3. **Extended Testing**
   Multiple test cases were evaluated for idempotence:

   | Input | First Call | Second Call | Idempotent? |
   |-------|------------|-------------|-------------|
   | `'"'` | `'"""'` | `'"""""'` | **False** |
   | `'hello'` | `'"hello"'` | `'"hello"'` | True |
   | `'"hello"'` | `'"hello"'` | `'"hello"'` | True |
   | `'"""'` | `'"""""'` | `'"""""""'` | **False** |
   | `'hello"world'` | `'"hello"world"'` | `'""hello"world""'` | **False** |
   | `''` | `'""'` | `'""'` | True |
   | `'""'` | `'""'` | `'""'` | True |

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs because:
1. The ETAG_MATCH regex pattern `"[^"]*"` only matches quoted strings that don't contain internal quotes
2. When `quote_etag` wraps a string containing quotes (like `"`), the result (`"""`) doesn't match the pattern
3. A subsequent call wraps it again, producing `"""""`, violating idempotence

### Effect
The function fails to be idempotent for any input containing quote characters. This violates the documented contract that states "If the provided string is already a quoted ETag, return it." The function cannot correctly identify its own output as "already a quoted ETag" when the input contains quotes.

This could cause issues in production where `quote_etag` might be called multiple times on the same ETag value through middleware layers or caching systems, resulting in incorrectly formatted ETags with multiple layers of quotes.
