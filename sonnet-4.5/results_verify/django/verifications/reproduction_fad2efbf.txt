## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Claims
The bug report claims that `is_same_domain` incorrectly handles case sensitivity in domain comparisons, failing to match domains that differ only in case.

### Reproduction Results

#### 1. Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis test from the bug report DOES fail:
- Test: `is_same_domain(domain, domain)` should always return True for any domain
- Failing input: `domain='A'`
- Result: Returns `False` instead of `True`
- This confirms the basic claim: a domain doesn't match itself when it contains uppercase letters

#### 2. Specific Examples
All examples from the bug report were confirmed:

1. `is_same_domain('EXAMPLE.COM', 'EXAMPLE.COM')` returns `False`
   - An uppercase domain doesn't match itself

2. `is_same_domain('Example.COM', 'example.com')` returns `False`
   - Mixed-case domain doesn't match lowercase version

3. `is_same_domain('FOO.EXAMPLE.COM', '.example.com')` returns `False`
   - Uppercase subdomain doesn't match lowercase wildcard pattern

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The code inspection confirms the issue:
- Line 235: `pattern = pattern.lower()` - the pattern is lowercased
- The host parameter is NOT lowercased
- Comparisons then happen between the original (potentially uppercase) host and the lowercased pattern

This creates an asymmetry:
- `is_same_domain('example.com', 'EXAMPLE.COM')` returns `True` (lowercase host, uppercase pattern works)
- `is_same_domain('EXAMPLE.COM', 'example.com')` returns `False` (uppercase host, lowercase pattern fails)

#### 4. Fix Verification
The proposed fix (adding `host = host.lower()` before the pattern lowercasing) was tested and:
- Resolves all failing test cases
- Makes the function behave symmetrically
- Passes the hypothesis test that any domain should match itself
- Aligns with DNS case-insensitivity requirements

### Technical Accuracy
The bug report is technically accurate:
1. The function does fail on the provided test cases
2. The root cause analysis is correct
3. The proposed fix does resolve the issue
4. The reference to RFC 4343 is correct - DNS is case-insensitive
