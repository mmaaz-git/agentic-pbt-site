## Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The code directly violates an explicitly documented contract - the Operation base class states operations "should be considered immutable" (line 27-28 of base.py)
2. The mutation causes actual observable problems:
   - Operations can be reused in the optimizer's multiple iterations
   - The same operation instance could be used multiple times
   - State changes persist unexpectedly
3. The reduce() method documentation says it should "Return" operations, not mutate them
4. The bug has a clear, correct fix using the existing clone() method
5. This affects correctness of the migration optimizer, a core Django feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is a clear violation of documented behavior.

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The documentation explicitly states operations should be immutable.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The immutability requirement is clearly documented in the base class
2. The bug reproduces exactly as reported
3. The behavior violates the documented contract

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue it's an edge case that rarely causes problems in practice

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not a trivial issue - it violates a core architectural principle
2. Migration optimization is a critical path in Django applications
3. The fix is simple and uses existing infrastructure (clone() method)
4. State mutation in supposedly immutable objects is a serious design violation

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The documentation is correct - it states operations should be immutable.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation correctly describes the expected behavior
2. The code is wrong, not the documentation
3. The base class documentation clearly states immutability requirement

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The immutability is already a documented requirement
2. This is fixing a violation of existing contracts, not requesting new behavior
3. The expected behavior (immutability) is already specified

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code violates an explicit immutability contract documented in the Operation base class. The mutation can cause real problems when operations are reused by the optimizer, and the fix is straightforward using the existing clone() method. This is not an edge case or undefined behavior - it's a direct violation of documented requirements.
