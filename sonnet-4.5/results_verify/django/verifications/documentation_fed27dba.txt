DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS

1. Django's LANG_INFO Structure:
   - Located in django/conf/locale/__init__.py
   - Contains metadata about languages including a 'bidi' field
   - The 'bidi' field indicates if a language uses bidirectional text (right-to-left)
   - When bidi=True, it means the language is written right-to-left
   - When bidi=False, it means the language is written left-to-right

2. Django Documentation on Bidirectional Text:
   - The LANGUAGES_BIDI setting contains language codes for RTL languages
   - RTL languages include those using Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, or N'Ko scripts
   - The bidi field is used to determine text directionality in Django templates and forms

3. Current Languages Marked as RTL (bidi=True) in Django:
   - ar (Arabic) - Uses Arabic script
   - ar-dz (Algerian Arabic) - Uses Arabic script
   - az (Azerbaijani) - Currently marked as RTL
   - ckb (Central Kurdish/Sorani) - Uses Arabic script
   - fa (Persian) - Uses Arabic script
   - he (Hebrew) - Uses Hebrew script
   - ug (Uyghur) - Uses Arabic script
   - ur (Urdu) - Uses Arabic script

4. Azerbaijani Language Research:
   - Historically used Arabic script (RTL) until the 1920s
   - Used Latin script from 1922-1939 (LTR)
   - Used Cyrillic script from 1939-1991 (LTR)
   - Officially adopted Latin script on December 25, 1991 (LTR)
   - Since 2001, Latin script is mandatory for official use in Azerbaijan
   - The Latin script version uses left-to-right text direction
   - South Azerbaijani (in Iran) still uses Arabic script (RTL)
   - North Azerbaijani (Republic of Azerbaijan) uses Latin script (LTR)

5. Key Finding:
   The Django codebase appears to be treating all Azerbaijani (code 'az') as RTL, which would be appropriate for the Iranian/South Azerbaijani variant using Arabic script, but is incorrect for the official Azerbaijani language of the Republic of Azerbaijan which has used Latin script exclusively since 1991.

6. No Specific Documentation Found:
   - No Django documentation explicitly states which variant of Azerbaijani 'az' represents
   - No documentation specifies whether 'az' should be the Latin or Arabic script variant
   - The locale name shows "Az…ôrbaycanca" which is the Latin script spelling, not Arabic
