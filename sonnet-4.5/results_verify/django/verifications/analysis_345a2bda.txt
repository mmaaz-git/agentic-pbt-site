## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. **Violates DNS Standards**: RFC 1035 explicitly mandates case-insensitive domain comparison. This is not optional.
2. **Security Impact**: The function is used in Django's security infrastructure (CSRF/CORS protection, ALLOWED_HOSTS). Incorrect matching could lead to security vulnerabilities.
3. **Partial Implementation Bug**: The code already lowercases the pattern (line 235), showing clear intent for case-insensitive matching. Forgetting to lowercase the host is an obvious oversight.
4. **Asymmetric Behavior**: is_same_domain('a', 'A') returns True but is_same_domain('A', 'a') returns False. This asymmetry is clearly unintentional.
5. **Real-world Impact**: HTTP Host headers can arrive in any case. Browsers and proxies may modify case. This bug would cause legitimate requests to fail.
6. **Simple Fix**: The fix is trivial (add host = host.lower()) and has no negative side effects.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state case-insensitive matching required

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. DNS standards (RFC 1035) are explicit about case-insensitive comparison
2. The function already partially implements case-insensitive matching (lowercases pattern)
3. No reasonable developer would expect domain matching to be case-sensitive
4. The asymmetric behavior is clearly wrong

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue users should normalize input themselves

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is a security-critical function - it MUST work correctly
2. The bug causes actual failures in production systems
3. The fix is trivial with no downsides
4. The function already attempts case-insensitive matching (just incompletely)

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue case-insensitive matching is a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function already partially implements this (lowercases pattern)
2. DNS standards require case-insensitive comparison - it's not optional
3. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
4. The current behavior is asymmetric and clearly buggy

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation could be clearer about case sensitivity

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code behavior is wrong, not just the documentation
2. Even if docs were updated to say "case-sensitive", that would violate DNS standards
3. The partial implementation shows the intent was case-insensitive
4. This needs a code fix, not just documentation

### Final Assessment:
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The function:
1. Violates DNS RFC 1035 standards
2. Has asymmetric behavior that makes no sense
3. Already partially implements case-insensitive matching (showing clear intent)
4. Is used in security-critical contexts where correctness matters
5. Has a trivial fix with no downsides

The fact that the function already lowercases the pattern but not the host is the smoking gun - this is clearly an implementation oversight, not intentional behavior.
