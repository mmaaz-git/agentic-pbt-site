BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

1. BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
   - FileBasedBackend.send_messages([]) returns None instead of 0
   - This is inherited from ConsoleEmailBackend
   - The bug violates the documented API contract

2. REPRODUCTION TEST RESULTS:

   a) Direct Testing:
      - FileBasedBackend.send_messages([]): Returns None (CONFIRMED)
      - ConsoleEmailBackend.send_messages([]): Returns None (CONFIRMED)
      - DummyBackend.send_messages([]): Returns 0 (correct)
      - LocmemBackend.send_messages([]): Returns 0 (correct)
      - SMTPBackend.send_messages([]): Returns 0 (correct)

   b) Property-Based Test (from bug report):
      - Test FAILED with AssertionError: "Expected int, got NoneType: None"
      - Both fail_silently=True and fail_silently=False cases fail
      - The bug report's test case is accurate

3. ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION:
   - Examined ConsoleEmailBackend.send_messages() source code
   - Line 31 contains: "if not email_messages: return"
   - This returns None (implicit Python behavior when no value specified)
   - Should be: "if not email_messages: return 0"

4. INHERITANCE CHAIN VERIFIED:
   - FileBasedBackend inherits from ConsoleEmailBackend
   - FileBasedBackend does NOT override send_messages()
   - Therefore, it inherits the buggy behavior from ConsoleEmailBackend

5. IMPACT:
   - Any code expecting an integer return value will fail
   - Example: total_sent = backend.send_messages([])
   - Attempting arithmetic on None will raise TypeError
   - Code like "if backend.send_messages(msgs) > 0:" will fail

CONCLUSION: The bug is 100% reproducible exactly as described in the bug report. The technical details are correct, and the proposed fix (returning 0 instead of None) is appropriate.
