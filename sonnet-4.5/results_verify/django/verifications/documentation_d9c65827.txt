## Documentation Analysis

I've reviewed Django's official documentation and source code to understand the expected behavior of MAX_ENTRIES and CULL_FREQUENCY:

### Official Documentation

From Django's cache documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/cache/):

1. **MAX_ENTRIES**:
   - Documented as "the maximum number of entries allowed in the cache before old values are deleted"
   - Default value: 300
   - Clear expectation: The cache should NOT exceed this number

2. **CULL_FREQUENCY**:
   - Controls "the fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached"
   - The culling ratio is "1 / CULL_FREQUENCY"
   - Default value: 3 (meaning 1/3 of entries are removed)
   - Special case: 0 means "the entire cache will be dumped when MAX_ENTRIES is reached"

### Expected Behavior vs Actual Behavior

The documentation clearly states that MAX_ENTRIES controls "the maximum number of entries allowed in the cache". This establishes an invariant that the cache size should never exceed MAX_ENTRIES.

**Expected**: When the cache reaches MAX_ENTRIES, the culling process should remove enough entries to maintain this constraint.

**Actual**: When CULL_FREQUENCY > current cache size, the integer division results in 0 items being culled, allowing the cache to exceed MAX_ENTRIES.

### Documentation Clarity

The documentation is unambiguous about MAX_ENTRIES being a hard limit. There is no mention of scenarios where this limit might be exceeded. The name itself - "MAX_ENTRIES" - strongly implies a maximum that should not be violated.

### Conclusion

The bug violates the documented behavior. The documentation clearly establishes that MAX_ENTRIES is the maximum number of entries allowed, and the current implementation fails to enforce this constraint in certain configurations. This is not a documentation error but a genuine implementation bug.
