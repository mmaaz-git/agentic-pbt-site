## Django Signal Documentation Analysis

After examining the Django source code in dispatcher.py, here are the key findings from the documentation:

### Signal.connect() Documentation (lines 69-71)
The documentation for the `sender` parameter in Signal.connect() states:
"sender: The sender to which the receiver should respond. Must either be a Python object, or None to receive events from any sender."

This clearly states that sender can be "a Python object" - which is a very broad category that includes all Python objects.

### Signal.send_robust() Documentation (lines 282-284)
The documentation states:
"sender: The sender of the signal. Can be any Python object (normally one registered with a connect if you actually want something to occur)."

Again, this explicitly states "Can be any Python object".

### Signal.__init__ Documentation
The Signal class has a `use_caching` parameter that is not well documented in the code. The only documentation is in line 35-47:
- "Create a new signal."
- Comments explain that when use_caching is True, it creates a sender_receivers_cache using weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()
- No documentation mentions that use_caching imposes limitations on what types can be used as senders

### Implementation Details (line 47)
The code creates: `self.sender_receivers_cache = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary() if use_caching else {}`

This is the source of the problem - WeakKeyDictionary requires keys that support weak references.

### Key Findings
1. The documentation explicitly states that senders can be "any Python object" or "a Python object" with no qualifications about weak reference support
2. The use_caching parameter is not documented to impose any restrictions on sender types
3. There is no warning in the documentation that certain Python objects (int, str, tuple, None, object() instances) cannot be used as senders when use_caching=True
4. The implementation contradicts the documented API contract
