## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments for BUG:**
1. The class promises "case-insensitive key lookups" without qualification
2. If a key can be stored with one case, it's reasonable to expect retrieval with other cases
3. The failure is not an edge case - German 'ÃŸ' is a common character in one of the world's major languages
4. The fix is straightforward - use `.casefold()` instead of `.lower()`
5. Python provides `.casefold()` specifically for this purpose (proper Unicode case-insensitive matching)
6. The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise

**This appears to be the most appropriate classification.**

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The documentation does promise "case-insensitive key lookups"
- The test case is reasonable and uses a real-world character
- The expectation that case variations should work is justified

**Why it's not INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The user expectation is reasonable given the documentation
- This is not a case of misunderstanding the API

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- The class is primarily used for HTTP headers which are ASCII
- The edge case affects only specific Unicode characters
- Existing code might depend on the current behavior

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - German is widely used
- The fix doesn't break backward compatibility for ASCII
- Django generally aims for proper Unicode support

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code could be considered "working as designed" with `.lower()`
- Documentation could be updated to specify ASCII-only or limited Unicode support
- Could document that it uses `.lower()` not `.casefold()`

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The name "CaseInsensitiveMapping" strongly implies it should handle all cases properly
- Limiting to ASCII would be a regression in Django's Unicode support
- Users shouldn't need to understand Unicode internals to use this class

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting full Unicode case folding could be seen as a new feature
- The current implementation might have been intentionally limited

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The class already claims to provide case-insensitive lookups
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality
- The class accepts Unicode strings, so it should handle them correctly

### Final Assessment

This should be classified as **BUG** because:

1. The class documentation promises "case-insensitive key lookups" without any stated limitations
2. The class accepts Unicode strings but fails to handle them correctly
3. Python provides the proper tool (`.casefold()`) for this exact purpose
4. The failure affects real-world usage (German language)
5. The fix is simple and doesn't break backward compatibility for the common ASCII case
6. Django generally strives for proper Unicode support throughout the framework

The implementation is clearly incorrect for Unicode strings with asymmetric case transformations, and this violates the documented behavior of providing case-insensitive lookups.
