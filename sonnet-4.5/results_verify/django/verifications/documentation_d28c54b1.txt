## Documentation Analysis for truncate_name

### Function Documentation

The function `truncate_name` in django/db/backends/utils.py has the following documentation:

**Docstring:**
```python
"""
Shorten an SQL identifier to a repeatable mangled version with the given
length.

If a quote stripped name contains a namespace, e.g. USERNAME"."TABLE,
truncate the table portion only.
"""
```

**Function Signature:**
```python
def truncate_name(identifier, length=None, hash_len=4):
```

### What the Documentation Says

1. **Purpose**: The function should "Shorten an SQL identifier to a repeatable mangled version with the given length"
   - Key phrase: "with the given length" - this implies the result should respect the length parameter

2. **Parameters**:
   - `identifier`: The SQL identifier to potentially truncate
   - `length`: The maximum length for the result (None means no truncation)
   - `hash_len`: Length of the hash digest to append (default 4)

3. **Namespace Handling**: If the identifier contains a namespace (e.g., USERNAME"."TABLE), only the table portion is truncated

### Documentation Interpretation

The documentation states the function should produce an identifier "with the given length". This is a clear contract that the output should not exceed the specified length parameter. The phrase "with the given length" strongly implies:
- If length=1, the result should be 1 character
- If length=10, the result should be at most 10 characters
- The function should honor the length constraint

### Real-World Usage Context

From analyzing Django's codebase:

1. **Oracle Backend**: Uses `truncate_name(name, self.max_name_length())` where max_name_length() returns 30
   - This shows the function is used to enforce database-specific identifier length limits
   - Oracle has a strict 30-character limit on identifiers

2. **Model Options**: Uses it to ensure db_table names fit within database limits

3. **Schema Editor**: Uses it to truncate index and constraint names to database limits

### Critical Observation

The function is used throughout Django to ensure identifiers comply with database-specific length restrictions. Databases will reject identifiers that exceed their limits, so this function MUST produce identifiers that are <= the specified length.

### Documentation Completeness

The documentation does NOT specify:
- What happens when length < hash_len
- Whether the length parameter has a minimum valid value
- Any constraints on the relationship between length and hash_len

However, the documentation DOES clearly state the result should be "with the given length", which is an unambiguous contract that the result should respect the length parameter.

### Conclusion on Documentation

The documentation clearly establishes that:
1. The function should produce an identifier "with the given length"
2. This is used to comply with database identifier length limits
3. The actual implementation violates this contract when length < hash_len

The bug report correctly identifies that the function violates its documented behavior. The function fails to deliver on its promise to produce an identifier "with the given length" when that length is less than hash_len.
