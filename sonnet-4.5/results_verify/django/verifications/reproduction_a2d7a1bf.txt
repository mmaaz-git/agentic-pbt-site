BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

I have successfully reproduced the behavior described in the bug report. Here are the results:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
- The Hypothesis property-based test fails immediately
- Found numerous failing cases where q1 & q2 != q2 & q1
- Example: Q(id=0) & Q(id=1) != Q(id=1) & Q(id=0)

2. COMMUTATIVITY TEST FOR AND:
- Q(id=0) & Q(id=1) produces: (AND: ('id', 0), ('id', 1))
- Q(id=1) & Q(id=0) produces: (AND: ('id', 1), ('id', 0))
- These are NOT equal according to Q's __eq__ method
- The order of children in the combined Q object depends on the order of combination

3. IDEMPOTENCE TEST:
- Q(id=0) & Q(id=0) produces: (AND: ('id', 0), ('id', 0))
- Q(id=0) alone is: (AND: ('id', 0))
- These are NOT equal - idempotence doesn't hold
- The combined version has duplicate children

4. COMMUTATIVITY TEST FOR OR:
- Q(id=0) | Q(id=1) produces: (OR: ('id', 0), ('id', 1))
- Q(id=1) | Q(id=0) produces: (OR: ('id', 1), ('id', 0))
- These are also NOT equal

5. DE MORGAN'S LAW TEST:
- ~(Q(id=0) & Q(id=1)) produces: (NOT (AND: ('id', 0), ('id', 1)))
- ~Q(id=0) | ~Q(id=1) produces: (OR: (NOT (AND: ('id', 0))), (NOT (AND: ('id', 1))))
- These are NOT equal according to Q's equality comparison

6. IDENTITY PROPERTY COMPARISON:
- (Q(id=0) & Q(id=1)).identity = ('django.db.models.Q', ('id', 0), ('id', 1))
- (Q(id=1) & Q(id=0)).identity = ('django.db.models.Q', ('id', 1), ('id', 0))
- The identity tuples differ in the order of children

7. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
The bug report's technical claims are CORRECT:
- The equality comparison is indeed order-dependent
- The root cause is correctly identified: children are preserved in combination order
- The identity property includes the ordering, making equality order-dependent

8. IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT SQL GENERATION:
While the Q objects are not equal according to __eq__, they would likely generate equivalent SQL queries:
- Both Q(id=0) & Q(id=1) and Q(id=1) & Q(id=0) would generate SQL like: WHERE id = 0 AND id = 1
- The SQL database would treat these as logically equivalent
- The issue is with Python-level equality comparison, not SQL generation

SUMMARY:
All technical claims in the bug report have been verified and are accurate. The Q object equality comparison does not satisfy boolean algebra properties like commutativity, idempotence, and De Morgan's laws.
