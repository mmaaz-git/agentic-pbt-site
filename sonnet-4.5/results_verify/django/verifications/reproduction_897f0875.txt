## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Results

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The tests confirm that `get_exception_info` does crash with an `IndexError` under certain conditions.

### Confirmed Crash Scenarios

1. **Empty source with lineno > 1**:
   - Input: `lineno=2, source=''`
   - Result: `IndexError: list index out of range`
   - This happens because the code tries to access `lines[1]` when `lines` is `[('', 1)]`

2. **Line number exceeds total lines**:
   - Input: `lineno=5, source='line1\nline2'`
   - Result: `IndexError: list index out of range`
   - The code tries to access `lines[4]` when only indices 0-1 exist

### Scenarios That Don't Crash (But Produce Incorrect Results)

3. **Zero line number**:
   - Input: `lineno=0, source='line1\nline2'`
   - Result: Returns successfully but with incorrect `during` value
   - `lines[0-1]` = `lines[-1]` accesses the last line due to Python's negative indexing

4. **Negative line number**:
   - Input: `lineno=-1, source='line1\nline2'`
   - Result: Returns successfully but with incorrect `during` value
   - `lines[-1-1]` = `lines[-2]` accesses the second-to-last line

5. **Source is None**:
   - Result: Handled correctly by the existing else clause

### Hypothesis Test Result

The hypothesis test from the bug report fails exactly as described:
```
Falsifying example: test_get_exception_info_doesnt_crash(
    lineno=2,
    source='',
    filename='0',
    message=''
)
```

### Real Jinja2 Behavior

Testing with actual Jinja2 TemplateSyntaxError instances shows:
- Real Jinja2 exceptions always have positive, valid line numbers
- Line numbers are 1-based and always within the source bounds
- When source is available, lineno correctly points to the error location

### Technical Analysis

The crash occurs at line 106 in the current code:
```python
during = lines[lineno - 1][1]
```

This line assumes:
1. `lineno >= 1` (to avoid negative indices having different meaning)
2. `lineno <= len(lines)` (to avoid IndexError)

Neither assumption is validated before the array access, causing the crashes.

### Impact Assessment

While the crashes are reproducible, they only occur with:
1. Artificially constructed exception objects
2. Invalid line numbers that Jinja2 would never produce
3. Edge cases that don't occur in normal Django/Jinja2 operation

The function is only called internally by Django when handling real Jinja2 exceptions, which always have valid line numbers.
