## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the findings:

### Test Results

1. **Direct reproduction test**: The simple test case creates a custom file-like object (`FalsyButOpenFile`) that:
   - Returns `False` when evaluated as a boolean (`__bool__` returns False)
   - Has a `closed` property that returns `False` (indicating the file is open)

   When this object is wrapped in Django's `File` class (which inherits from `FileProxyMixin`), the following behavior occurs:
   - `falsy_file.closed` returns `False` (correctly indicating the file is open)
   - `file_obj.closed` returns `True` (incorrectly indicating the file is closed)

2. **Hypothesis test**: The property-based test also fails with the same issue, confirming the bug is reproducible.

### Root Cause

The bug is in line 53 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/files/utils.py`:

```python
return not self.file or self.file.closed
```

This line uses the boolean evaluation `not self.file` to check if the file exists. When `self.file` is a falsy object (returns False from `__bool__`), the expression `not self.file` evaluates to `True`, causing the entire expression to return `True` even though `self.file.closed` is `False`.

### Impact

This bug causes the `closed` property to incorrectly report that a file is closed when:
1. The file object defines a `__bool__` method that returns False
2. The file is actually open (its `closed` property is False)

This is a logic error where the code conflates "falsiness" with "non-existence" of the file object.
