DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing the Django documentation, I found the following relevant information:

1. Documentation for send_mail() and send_mass_mail():
   - The documentation explicitly states that send_mail() returns "the number of successfully
     delivered messages (which can be 0 or 1 since it can only send one message)"
   - send_mass_mail() returns "the number of successfully delivered messages"
   - These functions have clear, documented return value contracts

2. Documentation for mail_admins() and mail_managers():
   - The Django documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/email/ describes
     the function signatures and parameters
   - The documentation DOES NOT specify any return value for these functions
   - The functions are described as convenience methods for sending emails to admins/managers

3. API Consistency Expectations:
   - While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that mail_admins() and mail_managers()
     should return values, there is no documentation that says they explicitly return None
   - The documentation shows all four functions (send_mail, send_mass_mail, mail_admins,
     mail_managers) in the same section as email sending utilities
   - Given that send_mail() and send_mass_mail() return message counts, users would reasonably
     expect similar behavior from other email sending functions in the same module

4. Documentation Implications:
   - The lack of documented return values for mail_admins() and mail_managers() could be
     interpreted as either:
     a) An oversight in documentation (the functions should document they return None)
     b) An oversight in implementation (the functions should return counts like the others)
   - Given that all functions call the underlying mail.send() which returns a count, and
     that two of the four email functions return this count, the more consistent interpretation
     is that all email sending functions should return the count

5. Principle of Least Surprise:
   - Users familiar with send_mail() returning a count would naturally expect similar
     functions in the same module to behave consistently
   - The current behavior violates this principle by having inconsistent return behavior
     across similar functions
