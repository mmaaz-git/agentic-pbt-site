## Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Function crashes instead of gracefully handling edge cases**: The get_exception_info() function throws an IndexError when lineno exceeds the source line count, preventing Django from displaying any debug information
2. **Real-world scenario**: This can happen with malformed templates, corrupted exception state, or Jinja2 bugs that report incorrect line numbers
3. **Defeats the function's purpose**: A debugging utility should be resilient and not crash when trying to display error information
4. **Easy to fix**: Simple bounds checking would prevent the crash without changing expected behavior
5. **No documentation suggests this is intended behavior**: Nothing indicates that crashing is the expected response to out-of-bounds line numbers

### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. Could argue that Jinja2 should never produce invalid line numbers (but this isn't guaranteed)
2. Mock exceptions with invalid attributes aren't "real" exceptions (but the function should still handle them gracefully)

**Assessment**: Unlikely to be INVALID because debugging functions should be robust.

### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. Could be considered an obscure edge case that rarely happens in practice
2. The issue only affects artificially created exceptions or corrupted state

**Assessment**: Unlikely to be WONTFIX because:
- The fix is trivial (3-4 lines of code)
- The impact when it occurs is significant (complete crash)
- Debugging utilities should be especially resilient

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Documentation doesn't specify what happens with invalid line numbers
2. Could document that lineno must be within valid range

**Assessment**: Not a DOCUMENTATION_FIX because:
- The current behavior (crashing) is clearly unintended
- Documenting "the function crashes" wouldn't be acceptable for a debugging utility
- The code should be fixed, not the documentation

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could frame bounds checking as a new "feature" for handling invalid input

**Assessment**: Not a FEATURE_REQUEST because:
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The function already tries to handle missing source gracefully
- Preventing crashes is a bug fix, not a feature

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. A debugging utility function should never crash when trying to format exception information for display. The function's purpose is to help developers debug template errors, and crashing with an IndexError completely defeats this purpose. The fix is simple, the impact is real, and there's no reasonable argument that crashing is the intended behavior.
