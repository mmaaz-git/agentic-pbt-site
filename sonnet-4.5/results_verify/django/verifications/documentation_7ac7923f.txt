DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Python Documentation

### io.IOBase.writable() Specification
According to Python's official documentation for io.IOBase.writable():
- **Purpose**: "Return whether object was opened for writing"
- **Contract**: "If False, write() will raise OSError"
- **Expected Behavior**: Should return True if the file can be written to, False otherwise

### Python File Mode Specifications
Python's open() function supports the following modes that allow writing:
1. **'w'**: Write mode (truncates file)
2. **'w+'**: Write and read mode
3. **'a'**: Append mode (writes at end of file)
4. **'a+'**: Append and read mode
5. **'x'**: Exclusive creation (fails if file exists)
6. **'x+'**: Exclusive creation with read
7. **'r+'**: Read and write mode (no truncation)

Modes that do NOT allow writing:
- **'r'**: Read-only mode
- **'rb'**: Read-only binary mode

The '+' modifier always adds the complementary access mode (read to write modes, write to read mode).

### Django Documentation

#### FileProxyMixin Documentation
The FileProxyMixin class is documented as:
"A mixin class used to forward file methods to an underlying file object."

The class is designed to implement the Python file-like object protocol, which includes the writable() method from io.IOBase.

#### Implicit Contract
While Django's documentation doesn't explicitly state how FileProxyMixin.writable() should behave, the class name and purpose clearly indicate it should:
1. Act as a transparent proxy for file objects
2. Implement the standard Python file protocol correctly
3. Maintain compatibility with io.IOBase behavior

## Key Documentation Finding

The FileProxyMixin.writable() method is implementing the io.IOBase.writable() protocol. According to Python's documentation, this method should return True for ANY mode that allows writing, including:
- Write modes ('w', 'w+')
- Append modes ('a', 'a+')
- Exclusive creation modes ('x', 'x+')
- Read-write mode ('r+')

The current implementation violates this contract by only checking for 'w' in the mode string.

## Documentation Verdict

The bug represents a clear violation of the expected behavior based on:
1. **Python's io.IOBase contract**: The method should correctly identify all writable modes
2. **Principle of least surprise**: Users expect Django's file proxy to behave like Python's file objects
3. **Implicit documentation**: A "proxy" should faithfully reproduce the behavior of what it proxies

The documentation strongly supports that this is a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
