## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The current behavior of rejecting strings with trailing commas is not explicitly wrong according to the documentation. Neither Django's documentation nor the W3C specification explicitly states that trailing commas should be accepted. The examples in both Django and W3C documentation show properly formatted comma-separated lists without trailing commas. Standard CSV parsing in most contexts expects clean, well-formed input without trailing delimiters. The function is correctly identifying that an empty string is not a valid referrer policy value, which is technically accurate.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies that the code does fail on trailing commas, and the technical analysis is accurate. The reproduction shows that "origin," does indeed cause an error while "origin" does not. The behavior is real and observable, not a misunderstanding of how the code works.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case that results from sloppy input formatting. Users should provide clean, properly formatted configuration values without trailing commas. The error message clearly indicates what valid values are accepted, making it easy for users to fix their configuration. Supporting trailing commas might encourage bad configuration practices. The impact is minimal - users just need to remove the trailing comma, which is a trivial fix. This falls into the category of "user provided malformed input and got an appropriate error."

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Trailing commas are not entirely unreasonable in configuration files, especially when values are frequently edited or generated programmatically. The fix is simple and wouldn't break any existing functionality. Other parsing libraries and systems often tolerate trailing commas for user convenience.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation never explicitly states that trailing commas are invalid or will cause errors. The phrase "comma-separated string" is ambiguous about exact parsing rules. If the current behavior is intentional, the documentation should explicitly warn users that trailing commas, leading commas, or consecutive commas will cause validation errors. Adding a note like "The comma-separated string must not contain trailing commas or empty values" would clarify the expected format.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The examples in the documentation show proper comma-separated format without trailing commas, which implicitly suggests the correct format. The error message already tells users exactly what values are valid. Standard comma-separated value formats generally don't include trailing commas, so this might be considered common knowledge.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current code doesn't handle trailing commas gracefully, but it could be enhanced to do so. This would be adding new tolerance for malformed input rather than fixing broken functionality. Many modern parsers and configuration systems tolerate trailing commas as a quality-of-life improvement. The proposed fix would add this tolerance without breaking any existing valid configurations. This could be framed as "Add support for trailing commas in SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY parsing."

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report frames this as incorrect behavior rather than a missing feature. The reporter argues that trailing commas "should be tolerated" as if this is expected behavior, not a new capability. If users expect this to work based on their experience with other systems, it might be more than just a feature request.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The error occurs on input that could reasonably be considered valid by users. Trailing commas are common in many contexts (JSON5, JavaScript, Python, etc.) and users might expect them to work. The fix is trivial and safe - filtering empty strings wouldn't break any valid use cases. The current behavior is unnecessarily strict and provides a poor user experience for what amounts to harmless whitespace-like formatting.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The code is working exactly as designed - it validates that all parsed values are in the approved list, and empty string is not approved. No documentation promises that trailing commas would be accepted. HTTP header formats and CSV formats traditionally don't include trailing commas. The validation is correctly identifying invalid input according to its strict interpretation. This is a case of rejecting malformed input, which is appropriate behavior for a security-related configuration.

## Overall consideration
Looking at the evidence, this case falls into a gray area between user error and system inflexibility. The current implementation strictly validates all parsed values against the approved list, and empty strings resulting from trailing commas fail this validation. This is technically correct behavior - the empty string is indeed not a valid referrer policy value. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise tolerance for trailing commas, and the examples shown follow proper CSV format without trailing delimiters.

However, the severity and context matter here. This is a configuration validation function that runs at deployment time, not runtime parsing of user input. The consequence of the strict parsing is that developers might deploy with "origin," and get a cryptic error about invalid values, when their intent is clear. The proposed fix is minimal, safe, and wouldn't break any existing valid configurations - it simply filters out empty strings before validation. Many modern configuration systems tolerate such formatting variations for developer convenience.

The strongest argument against calling this a bug is that the error message clearly states what values are valid, and removing a trailing comma is a trivial fix for the user. The function is not broken - it's just strict. Given that this falls into the category of "code that complains about formatting that doesn't match expectations" and "code that could be more forgiving of common input variations," this leans toward either INVALID (working as strictly designed) or DOCUMENTATION_FIX (documentation should clarify the strict format requirements) rather than a true bug. The fact that similar systems might be more forgiving doesn't make Django's stricter approach incorrect, just less convenient.
