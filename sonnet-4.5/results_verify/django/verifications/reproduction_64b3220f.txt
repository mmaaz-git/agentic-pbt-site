BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

1. REPRODUCTION STATUS
----------------------
✓ Bug successfully reproduced
✓ Both test cases from bug report work as described
✓ Hypothesis test confirms the behavior across 100+ test cases

2. TEST RESULTS
---------------

Test 1 - Basic reproduction:
- Input: success_url = '/user/{user_id}/detail/' with object missing 'user_id' attribute
- Result: KeyError: 'user_id' (CONFIRMED)

Test 2 - Hypothesis minimal case:
- Input: success_url = '/path/{_}/' with empty object attributes
- Result: KeyError: '_' (CONFIRMED)

Test 3 - Valid case (control):
- Input: success_url = '/user/{user_id}/detail/' with object having user_id=123
- Result: '/user/123/detail/' (works correctly)

Test 4 - Existing error handling:
- Input: No success_url and object without get_absolute_url
- Result: ImproperlyConfigured exception with helpful message (existing behavior)

3. TECHNICAL DETAILS
--------------------
The bug occurs at line 120 of django/views/generic/edit.py:
    url = self.success_url.format(**self.object.__dict__)

This line:
- Uses Python's str.format() method
- Passes object.__dict__ as keyword arguments
- Has no try/except block to catch KeyError
- Results in raw KeyError being raised to the user

4. ERROR MESSAGE COMPARISON
----------------------------
Current behavior (KeyError):
- Error: KeyError: 'user_id'
- Provides no context about where the error occurred
- Doesn't explain that it's a configuration issue
- Unhelpful for developers debugging their views

Existing ImproperlyConfigured pattern:
- Error: "No URL to redirect to. Either provide a url or define a get_absolute_url method on the Model."
- Clear, actionable error message
- Indicates it's a configuration problem
- Helps developers understand what to fix

5. VERIFICATION
---------------
The property-based test successfully generated 100 test cases with mismatched placeholders.
All 100 cases raised KeyError as described in the bug report.
The behavior is consistent and reproducible.
