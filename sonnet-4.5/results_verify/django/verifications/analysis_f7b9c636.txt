## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments For:**
- The function does crash with empty parameters exactly as reported
- The crash is reproducible and the technical explanation is correct
- Adding the defensive check would prevent potential future issues

**Arguments Against:**
- This is a private method (underscore prefix) not meant for direct use
- The only documented caller (`last_executed_query`) already handles empty params
- Private methods don't have the same robustness requirements as public APIs
- The docstring explicitly warns "Only for last_executed_query!"

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- The function is private/internal (underscore prefix)
- The crash only occurs when misusing a private API
- The public API (`last_executed_query`) already protects against this case
- The impact is negligible since normal Django usage never encounters this
- Adding defensive checks to all private methods would add unnecessary overhead
- The function's docstring explicitly states it's only for `last_executed_query` use

**Arguments Against:**
- The fix is trivial (3 lines of code)
- Defensive programming is generally good practice

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The bug report tests a private method directly, which violates API boundaries
- Private methods in Python (underscore prefix) have no stability guarantees
- The function works correctly when used as intended (via `last_executed_query`)
- Testing private methods directly is not a valid use case

**Arguments Against:**
- The crash does technically occur as described
- The code analysis in the report is accurate

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could add documentation that the function requires non-empty params

**Arguments Against:**
- Private methods don't need public documentation
- The existing docstring already warns against direct use
- The warning "Only for last_executed_query!" is sufficient

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be seen as requesting enhanced robustness for edge cases

**Arguments Against:**
- The report frames this as a bug, not a feature request
- It's about fixing a crash, not adding new functionality

## Final Assessment

This is a case of a private method being called directly with invalid input that its intended caller already protects against. The key factors:

1. **Private API**: The underscore prefix clearly marks this as internal
2. **Existing Protection**: The only intended caller already checks for empty params
3. **Explicit Warning**: The docstring says "Only for last_executed_query!"
4. **No Real Impact**: This crash cannot occur through normal Django usage
5. **Invalid Test Case**: The property-based test is testing a private method directly

The bug report, while technically accurate about the crash, is testing an internal implementation detail that was never meant to be called directly. The "defensive programming" and "future-proofing" arguments don't apply to private methods that have explicit warnings against direct use.
