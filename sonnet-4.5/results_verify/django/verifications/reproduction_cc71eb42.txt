REPRODUCTION OF THE REPORTED BUG

1. Test Execution Results
-------------------------
I successfully ran the property-based test provided in the bug report. The results confirm the issue:

- The test FAILS for Azerbaijani ('az')
- Azerbaijani is marked with bidi=True in LANG_INFO
- Azerbaijani's name_local is "Azərbaycanca" which uses Latin script
- Latin script is left-to-right, not right-to-left

2. Comparison with Other Bidi Languages
----------------------------------------
Testing all 8 languages marked as bidi=True:
✓ Arabic (ar): name_local='العربيّة' - Uses Arabic script (RTL)
✓ Algerian Arabic (ar-dz): name_local='العربية الجزائرية' - Uses Arabic script (RTL)
✗ Azerbaijani (az): name_local='Azərbaycanca' - Uses Latin script (LTR)
✓ Central Kurdish (ckb): name_local='کوردی' - Uses Arabic script (RTL)
✓ Persian (fa): name_local='فارسی' - Uses Arabic script (RTL)
✓ Hebrew (he): name_local='עברית' - Uses Hebrew script (RTL)
✓ Uyghur (ug): name_local='ئۇيغۇرچە' - Uses Arabic script (RTL)
✓ Urdu (ur): name_local='اردو' - Uses Arabic script (RTL)

Azerbaijani is the ONLY language marked as bidi that doesn't use RTL script characters.

3. Character Analysis
---------------------
The Azerbaijani name_local "Azərbaycanca" consists of:
- Standard Latin letters: A, z, r, b, a, y, c, n
- Latin letter with diacritic: ə (U+0259, Latin Small Letter Schwa)
- All characters are in the Latin/IPA Extensions Unicode blocks
- None are in RTL script ranges (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.)

4. Technical Impact
-------------------
When bidi=True for Azerbaijani:
- Django templates will apply dir="rtl" to Azerbaijani content
- CSS will use direction:rtl and text-align:right
- This causes Azerbaijani text to display incorrectly (right-aligned, reversed reading order)
- User interfaces in Azerbaijani will have improper layout direction

5. Historical Context
--------------------
The bug report correctly notes:
- Azerbaijani used Arabic script until 1929 (RTL)
- Switched to Latin script in 1929-1939
- Used Cyrillic script 1939-1991 (LTR)
- Returned to Latin script in 1991 (LTR)
- Has used Latin script for 30+ years

CONCLUSION: The bug is reproducible exactly as reported. Azerbaijani is incorrectly marked as bidi=True despite using Latin script for over 30 years.
