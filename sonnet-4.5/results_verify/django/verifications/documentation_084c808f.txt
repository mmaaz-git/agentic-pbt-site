## Documentation Analysis

### Django Documentation

1. **File class documentation**: The official Django documentation for the File class (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/files/file/) does not explicitly document the `closed` property or its expected behavior. The documentation mentions the `close()` method but not the `closed` property.

2. **File handling documentation**: The Django file handling documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/files/) shows an example where `myfile.closed` returns `True` after a file is closed, suggesting that Django file objects should have a `closed` property that accurately reflects the state of the underlying file.

3. **FileProxyMixin documentation**: There is no public documentation for the `FileProxyMixin` class. This appears to be an internal implementation detail of Django's file handling system.

### Python Standard Library Documentation

The Python I/O documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html) clearly states that:
- The `closed` property is a boolean attribute that indicates whether the stream is closed
- It should return `True` if the stream is closed, `False` otherwise
- This is standard behavior for all Python file-like objects

### Expected Behavior

Based on Python's standard file object protocol and Django's own examples:
1. The `closed` property should accurately reflect whether the underlying file is closed
2. It should return `True` only when the file is actually closed
3. It should return `False` when the file is open

### Key Finding

The lack of explicit documentation for `FileProxyMixin.closed` does not excuse incorrect behavior. Since Django's File class is meant to be a proxy for file-like objects, it should correctly proxy the `closed` property of the underlying file object. The current implementation violates the principle of least surprise by:

1. Not correctly proxying the `closed` state of the underlying file
2. Conflating "falsiness" (boolean evaluation) with "non-existence" (None check)
3. Deviating from standard Python file object behavior

This is a clear violation of the expected behavior for file-like objects in Python, even though Django's documentation doesn't explicitly specify how the `closed` property should behave.
