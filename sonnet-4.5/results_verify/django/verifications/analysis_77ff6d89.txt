## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Analysis for BUG Classification
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The to_python() method violates its documented contract of normalizing inputs to a consistent representation
2. Same numeric value (123.456789) produces different Decimal objects based on input type
3. The general Django documentation states to_python() should serve as a "normalization point"
4. The inconsistency causes downstream issues in get_db_prep_value() which calls to_python() twice
5. The behavior is counterintuitive - users would expect DecimalField to enforce max_digits consistently
6. The bug is reproducible and has real impact on data consistency

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly specify how precision should be applied to different types
- Current behavior might be intentional to preserve Decimal precision when already in Decimal form

### Analysis for WONTFIX Classification
**Arguments FOR:**
- The issue only affects edge cases where precision exceeds max_digits
- Workaround exists: users can manually apply precision before passing to field
- Changing behavior could break existing code that relies on Decimal preservation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects basic field consistency
- The inconsistency can lead to data integrity issues
- The bug affects a core Django field used in financial applications

### Analysis for INVALID Classification
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state floats and Decimals must be treated identically
- The current behavior could be seen as "working as designed"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The to_python() contract clearly states it should normalize inputs consistently
- The inconsistency violates the principle of least surprise
- No reasonable interpretation of the documentation would suggest this inconsistency is intended

### Analysis for FEATURE_REQUEST Classification
**Arguments FOR:**
- Adding consistent precision handling could be seen as a new feature
- Documentation doesn't promise this specific behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The to_python() method already has a clear contract for normalization
- The fix addresses an inconsistency, not a missing capability

### Analysis for DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation could be clearer about precision handling
- The behavior might be intentional but poorly documented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is genuinely inconsistent, not just poorly documented
- Even if documentation were updated to describe current behavior, it would be describing a bug
- The general contract for to_python() already implies consistent normalization

### Conclusion
The evidence strongly supports BUG classification:

1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The Django documentation explicitly states that to_python() should normalize inputs to a consistent representation. Having different outputs for the same numeric value violates this contract.

2. **Real Impact**: This isn't a theoretical issue - it affects data consistency and can cause unexpected behavior in production systems, especially financial applications.

3. **Unexpected Behavior**: No developer would reasonably expect DecimalField to apply precision limits to floats but not Decimals. This violates the principle of least surprise.

4. **Not a Feature Request**: The field already has precision enforcement for floats; extending it to Decimals is fixing an inconsistency, not adding new functionality.

5. **Not Just Documentation**: While documentation could be clearer, the core issue is the inconsistent code behavior, not unclear documentation.

The bug is valid, has real impact, and should be fixed to ensure consistent behavior across input types.
