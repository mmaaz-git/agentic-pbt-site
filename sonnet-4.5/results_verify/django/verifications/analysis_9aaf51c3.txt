BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS

Analyzing whether this should be classified as BUG, WONTFIX, INVALID, FEATURE_REQUEST, or DOCUMENTATION_FIX:

1. CONSIDERATION FOR BUG (VALID):
   STRONG EVIDENCE:
   - The function is named "is_same_domain" which clearly implies domain comparison
   - DNS RFC 1035 mandates case-insensitive domain comparison
   - The function already lowercases the pattern but not the host - inconsistent behavior
   - This causes actual failures in Django's CSRF middleware with mixed-case domains
   - The fix is trivial (one line: host = host.lower())
   - The behavior violates fundamental DNS principles

   This appears to be a clear bug - the function doesn't correctly implement domain comparison.

2. CONSIDERATION FOR WONTFIX:
   WEAK EVIDENCE:
   - Could argue it's an internal function not meant for public use
   - Some Django code (validate_host) already works around this by pre-lowercasing

   However, this is NOT a good candidate for WONTFIX because:
   - It affects CSRF security middleware functionality
   - The bug has real-world impact
   - It's not an obscure edge case - domain casing is common

3. CONSIDERATION FOR INVALID:
   NO EVIDENCE:
   - The bug report is correct and reproducible
   - The claimed DNS standard (RFC 1035) is accurate
   - The code demonstrably fails on valid test cases

   This is clearly NOT INVALID.

4. CONSIDERATION FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
   WEAK EVIDENCE:
   - Could argue the function never promised case-insensitive comparison

   However, this is NOT a feature request because:
   - Domain comparison inherently implies case-insensitivity per DNS standards
   - The function name "is_same_domain" implies correct domain comparison
   - The function already partially implements case-insensitivity (for pattern)

5. CONSIDERATION FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   WEAK EVIDENCE:
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly state case sensitivity

   However, this is NOT just a documentation issue because:
   - The code behavior is objectively wrong for domain comparison
   - Documenting "domains must be pre-lowercased" would be a workaround, not a fix
   - The inconsistency (lowercasing pattern but not host) suggests a bug, not design

FINAL ASSESSMENT:

This is a BUG. The function fails to correctly implement domain comparison according to
established DNS standards. It causes real issues in Django's CSRF middleware and has a
simple, obvious fix. The function already attempts case-insensitive comparison by
lowercasing the pattern, indicating the intent was case-insensitive matching, but the
implementation is incomplete/buggy.
