## Reproduction of Bug Report

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Basic Test Case
When calling `truncate_name('00', 1)`:
- Expected: Result should be at most 1 character long
- Actual: Result is 'b4b1' which is 4 characters long
- The function violates its length constraint by returning a string longer than the specified length

### Property-Based Test
The Hypothesis test fails immediately with the same input:
- identifier='00', length=1
- Result: 'b4b1' (length 4)
- This confirms the bug is reproducible and violates the length invariant

### Idempotence Test
The function is also not idempotent when length < hash_len:
- First call: truncate_name('00', 1) = 'b4b1'
- Second call: truncate_name('b4b1', 1) = 'bfde7'
- The function produces different results when called repeatedly with its own output

### Root Cause Analysis
Looking at the source code (lines 283-301), the issue occurs in line 299:
```python
name[: length - hash_len]
```

When `length=1` and `hash_len=4` (default), this becomes `name[: 1-4]` = `name[:-3]`.
With `name='00'`, this gives us an empty string (slicing with negative stop index).
The function then concatenates:
- Empty namespace prefix: ""
- Empty truncated name: ""
- Full 4-character hash digest: "b4b1"

Result: "b4b1" which is 4 characters, violating the length=1 constraint.

The bug is confirmed and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
