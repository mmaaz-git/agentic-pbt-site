Django include() Function Documentation Analysis
================================================

After examining the Django source code for the include() function in django/urls/conf.py, I found the following:

1. Function Signature:
   - include(arg, namespace=None)
   - Returns a 3-tuple: (urlconf_module, app_name, namespace)

2. Function Behavior:
   The function accepts two forms of the first argument:
   a) A string or module containing URL patterns
   b) A 2-tuple containing (urlconf_module, app_name)

3. Key Logic for app_name and namespace:
   - Line 18: app_name is initialized to None
   - Lines 19-33: If arg is a tuple, it extracts urlconf_module and app_name from it
   - Line 41: app_name can be overridden by an attribute from the urlconf_module
   - Line 42: The critical validation check: "if namespace and not app_name:"
   - Lines 43-48: Raises ImproperlyConfigured if namespace is provided but app_name is falsy
   - Line 49: namespace defaults to app_name if namespace wasn't explicitly provided

4. Documentation Absence:
   - The function has NO docstring or inline documentation
   - There is no explicit documentation about whether empty string '' is a valid app_name
   - There is no specification about the distinction between None and empty string for app_name
   - The error message (lines 44-47) says "without providing an app_name" which is ambiguous about whether '' counts as "providing" an app_name

5. Error Message Analysis:
   The error message states: "Specifying a namespace in include() without providing an app_name is not supported."
   This message suggests the issue is about "not providing" an app_name, but the code uses truthiness check (not app_name) rather than existence check (app_name is None).

6. Implicit Expectations:
   - The code appears to assume that if app_name is provided, it should be truthy
   - However, this is never explicitly documented
   - Python convention typically distinguishes between None (absence of value) and empty string (a provided but empty value)

Conclusion:
The documentation is completely absent for this function. There is no specification about:
- What constitutes a valid app_name
- Whether empty string is considered "providing" an app_name
- The relationship and constraints between namespace and app_name beyond the error message
- Why app_name is required when namespace is provided
