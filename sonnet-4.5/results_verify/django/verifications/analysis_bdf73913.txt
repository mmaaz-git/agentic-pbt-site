## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report describes a situation that would never occur in real Django applications. Empty template names are not a documented or supported use case. Django templates are meant to be loaded from files or strings with meaningful content, not empty names. The documentation doesn't guarantee cache key uniqueness for all possible inputs, only for valid template usage patterns. The test case uses an undocumented internal API (CachedLoader.__new__) without proper initialization, which is not how the loader is intended to be used.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The technical claim in the bug report is factually correct - there is indeed a cache key collision. The code does accept empty strings as template names without raising an error. The cache_key method is a public method that should handle all inputs correctly. The collision violates the implicit expectation that different inputs should produce different cache keys.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an extremely obscure edge case that requires both an empty template name AND a template whose name exactly matches a SHA1 hash. The probability of this occurring in any real Django application is effectively zero. Empty template names serve no practical purpose in Django's template system. Fixing this would add complexity to handle a case that will never happen in practice. The bug is technically correct but has no real-world impact.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Cache key collisions can lead to incorrect template loading, which could be a security issue if exploited. The fix is simple and wouldn't significantly impact performance. Even edge cases should be handled correctly in a widely-used framework like Django. The principle of least surprise suggests that different inputs should produce different outputs.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify what constitutes a valid template name or whether empty strings are allowed. It doesn't document the cache key generation algorithm or guarantee uniqueness. Adding documentation to clarify that empty template names are not supported would prevent confusion. The current behavior could be documented as a known limitation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code behavior itself is arguably incorrect, not just undocumented. Simply documenting a cache key collision doesn't make it acceptable. The documentation already implies that caching should work correctly for all valid use cases. This is more of a code issue than a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting empty template names with proper cache key generation could be seen as a new feature. The current code wasn't designed to handle this edge case. Adding support for all edge cases including empty strings would be an enhancement. This could be framed as "Add support for empty template names in cached loader."

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't about adding new functionality but fixing existing behavior. The cache_key method already accepts empty strings, it just handles them incorrectly. Cache key uniqueness is a basic expectation, not a feature. The bug report is about fixing a collision, not requesting new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The cache_key method produces identical keys for different inputs, which violates the fundamental purpose of cache keys. The collision is deterministic and reproducible. The code accepts empty template names without error but handles them incorrectly. Different (template_name, skip) tuples should always produce different cache keys. The fix is straightforward and the current behavior is objectively wrong.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Empty template names are not a valid use case in Django's template system. The bug requires an extremely unlikely combination of conditions. No real Django application would ever encounter this issue. The code works correctly for all intended use cases. This is more of a theoretical problem than a practical bug.

**Overall consideration**
This bug report presents a technically accurate cache key collision in Django's cached template loader. The collision occurs when an empty template name with skip origins produces the same cache key as a template whose name is the SHA1 hash with no skip origins. While the technical analysis is correct and the collision is reproducible, this represents an extremely contrived edge case that would never occur in real-world Django applications.

Django templates are designed to load actual template files or strings with content. An empty template name serves no practical purpose and is not a documented or intended use case. Furthermore, the likelihood of having a template whose name exactly matches a SHA1 hash (40 hexadecimal characters) is virtually zero in practice. The bug report requires both of these highly improbable conditions to occur simultaneously.

Given that this issue has zero practical impact, occurs only with undocumented edge cases, and would require adding complexity to fix a problem that will never manifest in real applications, this should be closed as WONTFIX. While technically correct, the issue is too obscure and impractical to warrant a code change in a major framework like Django.
