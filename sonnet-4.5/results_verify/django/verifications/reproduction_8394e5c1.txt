## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in Django's Signal class when using `use_caching=True` with non-weakrefable senders.

### Reproduction Steps and Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction**:
   - The property-based test failed exactly as reported
   - When `use_caching=True`, calling `has_listeners()` crashes with:
     `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'NoneType' object`
   - When `use_caching=False`, the test passes

2. **Manual Test with sender=None**:
   - Created a Signal with `use_caching=True`
   - Connected a receiver
   - Calling `signal.send(sender=None)` resulted in:
     `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'NoneType' object`
   - Stack trace shows the error occurs in line 183 of dispatcher.py when accessing `self.sender_receivers_cache.get(sender)`

3. **Manual Test with sender=object()**:
   - Same setup with `use_caching=True`
   - Calling `signal.send(sender=object())` resulted in:
     `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'object' object`
   - Plain object instances cannot be weakly referenced in Python

4. **Control Test (use_caching=False)**:
   - All tests pass when `use_caching=False`
   - Both `sender=None` and `sender=object()` work correctly
   - Signals are sent and received as expected

5. **has_listeners() Method**:
   - Also crashes with `use_caching=True` when trying to check for listeners
   - Error occurs on line 156/425 of dispatcher.py
   - Same root cause: WeakKeyDictionary cannot handle non-weakrefable keys

### Root Cause Analysis:

The bug is located in `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, line 47:
```python
self.sender_receivers_cache = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary() if use_caching else {}
```

When `use_caching=True`, Django uses a `WeakKeyDictionary` for the sender cache. However, `WeakKeyDictionary` requires all keys to support weak references. Many common Python types cannot be weakly referenced:
- `None` (NoneType)
- Plain `object()` instances without __weakref__ slot
- Built-in types like int, str, float, etc.

The crash occurs whenever the code tries to access the cache with these sender types:
- In `send()` method at line 183
- In `_live_receivers()` method at line 425
- In `has_listeners()` method which calls `_live_receivers()`
- In `send_robust()` and async variants

### Impact:

This is a significant bug because:
1. `sender=None` is explicitly documented and widely used in Django to receive signals from any sender
2. The `use_caching` parameter is meant to be a transparent performance optimization
3. The bug makes `use_caching=True` incompatible with core Django functionality
4. It affects multiple Signal methods: send(), has_listeners(), send_robust(), asend(), asend_robust()

The bug report accurately describes the issue and provides valid reproduction code.
