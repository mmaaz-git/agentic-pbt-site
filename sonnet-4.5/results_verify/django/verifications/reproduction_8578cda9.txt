Bug Reproduction Results
========================

1. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - Code: CountsDict(word="hello", foo="bar")
   - Result: ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required
   - This confirms the bug - CountsDict cannot accept additional kwargs

2. Django's Actual Usage:
   - Code: CountsDict(word="hello")  # No additional kwargs
   - Result: Works correctly
   - Django only uses CountsDict this way, never passing additional kwargs

3. Property-Based Testing:
   - When kwargs_data is empty: Tests pass
   - When kwargs_data has entries: Tests fail with either:
     a) TypeError: dict expected at most 1 argument, got 2 (multiple kwargs)
     b) ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required (single kwarg)
   - This confirms that any non-empty kwargs cause failures

4. Source Code Inspection:
   - Current code: super().__init__(*args, *kwargs)
   - The bug is confirmed: using *kwargs (single asterisk) instead of **kwargs (double asterisk)
   - When *kwargs is used, Python tries to unpack the dictionary as positional arguments
   - This causes dict() to receive individual keys as arguments instead of key-value pairs

5. Comparison with Correct dict Subclass:
   - A properly implemented dict subclass uses super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
   - This correctly passes keyword arguments to the parent dict class
   - The test demonstrated that changing *kwargs to **kwargs fixes the issue

Technical Impact:
- The bug prevents CountsDict from accepting any keyword arguments beyond 'word'
- The class signature suggests it should accept **kwargs like any dict subclass
- The typo (*kwargs vs **kwargs) violates the Liskov Substitution Principle for dict subclasses
- However, Django's internal usage is not affected because it never passes additional kwargs
