BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

I will analyze this bug report against each possible classification:

1. INVALID (The report is incorrect)
   Arguments against INVALID:
   - The code behavior exactly matches what the bug report describes
   - mail_admins() and mail_managers() do return None while send_mail() returns int
   - The reproduction code works correctly and demonstrates the issue
   - The source code confirms the missing return statements

   Arguments for INVALID:
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly promise these functions return values
   - The functions technically work as designed (they send emails)

   Conclusion: This is NOT INVALID - the bug report accurately describes actual behavior

2. WONTFIX (Bug is trivial/uninteresting)
   Arguments for WONTFIX:
   - Users can still send emails successfully without the return value
   - The functions have worked this way for a long time without major complaints
   - Users can use send_mail() directly if they need return values

   Arguments against WONTFIX:
   - This is a clear API inconsistency in the same module
   - The fix is trivial (adding "return" to two lines)
   - It provides useful functionality (knowing if email was sent)
   - It's not an obscure edge case - these are primary Django email functions

   Conclusion: This is not trivial enough for WONTFIX

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Requesting new functionality)
   Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The documentation doesn't promise return values for these functions
   - This could be seen as adding new functionality rather than fixing a bug
   - The functions currently work as documented (send emails to admins/managers)

   Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This is fixing an inconsistency, not adding new functionality
   - The underlying mail.send() already returns the value; it's just not passed through
   - Other functions in the same module already provide this behavior
   - It's more of a consistency fix than a new feature

   Conclusion: While borderline, this leans more toward bug fix than feature

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation could be clearer about return values
   - One solution would be to document that these functions return None

   Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation isn't wrong - it just doesn't specify return values
   - The code behavior is inconsistent, not the documentation
   - Fixing documentation to say "returns None" would cement the inconsistency

   Conclusion: This is not primarily a documentation issue

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments for BUG:
   - Clear API inconsistency within the same module
   - Functions performing similar operations have different return behaviors
   - The fix is trivial and non-breaking (changing None to int won't break existing code)
   - Violates principle of least surprise
   - All functions call mail.send() which returns a value, but only some pass it through
   - Users lose useful information (whether email was sent) for no good reason

   Arguments against BUG:
   - Not explicitly documented to return values
   - Functions still work for their primary purpose

   Conclusion: This is a valid BUG

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This represents an API inconsistency within Django's email module. While the functions work
for sending emails, the inconsistent return behavior between similar functions in the same
module is a design flaw that should be corrected. The fix is trivial, backwards-compatible
(code checking for None will still work), and provides useful functionality that users of
send_mail() already enjoy.
