## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments For:**
- The error message is genuinely unhelpful and cryptic
- Django generally provides clear, actionable error messages throughout the framework
- The fix is simple and improves developer experience significantly
- Other Django APIs provide context in their error messages (e.g., "Model 'X' not found in app 'Y'")
- The proposed fix adds minimal overhead while greatly improving usability

**Arguments Against:**
- The documented contract only promises ValueError, not a specific message
- The error IS a ValueError as promised
- Technically the implementation meets the documented API contract

**Verdict:** Moderate case for BUG - improving error messages is a valid enhancement

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments For:**
- The error message issue only affects developers during development, not production
- Developers can easily look up the correct format in documentation
- The cryptic message still indicates something is wrong with the format
- This is a very minor issue that doesn't affect functionality

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a common mistake developers make
- The fix is trivial and has no downsides
- Django prides itself on developer-friendly APIs
- Poor error messages waste developer time

**Verdict:** Weak case for WONTFIX - the issue is meaningful enough to fix

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments For:**
- The implementation strictly follows the documentation (raises ValueError)
- The documentation never promises a user-friendly error message
- The error message accurately reflects what happened internally (unpacking failed)
- No explicit contract violation exists

**Arguments Against:**
- The spirit of the documentation implies helpful errors ("Raise ValueError if...")
- Django's general practice establishes an expectation of helpful errors
- The current error exposes implementation details rather than API requirements
- Users reasonably expect error messages to explain what they did wrong

**Verdict:** Weak case for INVALID - while technically correct, this misses the point

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments For:**
- Adding better error messages is an enhancement, not a bug fix
- The current behavior is not broken, just suboptimal
- This is requesting improved user experience, not fixing incorrect behavior
- The documentation doesn't promise clear error messages

**Arguments Against:**
- Error message quality is generally considered part of the API contract
- This isn't adding new functionality, just improving existing error handling
- Most would consider cryptic error messages a defect, not a missing feature

**Verdict:** Strong case for FEATURE_REQUEST - this is an enhancement to existing functionality

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments For:**
- The documentation could be clearer about the expected format
- Adding examples would help prevent this error
- The documentation could warn about the current error message

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation is already clear about the format requirement
- The issue is with the code's error message, not the documentation
- Fixing documentation doesn't solve the underlying usability problem

**Verdict:** Weak case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the docs are adequate

### Final Analysis

This bug report describes a real usability issue where Django provides an unhelpful error message. While the implementation technically meets the documented contract (raises ValueError), the error message quality is poor and inconsistent with Django's general practice of helpful errors.

The key question is whether poor error message quality constitutes a bug or a feature request. Given that:
1. The functionality works correctly (ValueError is raised)
2. The issue is about improving the user experience
3. The documentation doesn't promise specific error message content
4. This is enhancing existing behavior rather than fixing broken behavior

This should be categorized as a FEATURE_REQUEST rather than a BUG.
