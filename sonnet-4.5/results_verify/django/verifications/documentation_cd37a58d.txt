## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **Django Settings Documentation**
   - States that CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS should contain "trusted origins for unsafe requests"
   - Explicitly mentions values should include "the full URL scheme and domain"
   - Examples provided: `'https://subdomain.example.com'`, `'https://*.example.com'`
   - All examples show proper scheme at the beginning

2. **Error Message in Code**
   - Line 13-15: "As of Django 4.0, the values in the CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS setting **must start with a scheme** (usually http:// or https://)"
   - This message explicitly states the requirement that origins must START with a scheme
   - The validation logic contradicts this documented requirement

3. **Django 4.0 Release Notes Reference**
   - The error message references release notes for Django 4.0
   - This indicates a breaking change where Django 4.0 started requiring schemes in CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
   - Prior to 4.0, origins without schemes were presumably accepted

### Documentation vs Implementation Mismatch

The documentation and error messages clearly state that:
1. Origins MUST start with a scheme
2. The scheme is typically http:// or https://
3. This is a requirement as of Django 4.0

However, the implementation only checks if "://" exists anywhere in the string, which doesn't enforce:
- That a scheme exists before "://"
- That the scheme is at the start of the origin
- That the scheme is non-empty

### Conclusion

The documentation unambiguously requires that CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS values must start with a scheme. The current validation logic fails to enforce this documented requirement, making this a valid bug where the implementation doesn't match the documented behavior.
