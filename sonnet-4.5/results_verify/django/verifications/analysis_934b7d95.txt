BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS

## Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The code comment explicitly states the regex "matches all time zone names from the zoneinfo database"
2. The actual regex accepts far MORE than valid timezone names (Unicode characters)
3. This causes invalid timezone names to pass validation and reach Oracle database
4. Oracle will then reject these invalid names with cryptic error messages
5. Users get confusing errors instead of clear validation messages
6. The behavior contradicts the documented intent in the code comment
7. All valid IANA timezone names use only ASCII characters - verified empirically
8. The fix is straightforward: replace \w with [a-zA-Z0-9_]

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The regex does successfully match all valid timezone names (no false negatives)
- It's primarily an over-permissive validation issue, not a functionality break
- Security is not compromised (SQL injection chars are still blocked)

## Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. The regex correctly blocks dangerous characters (quotes, semicolons, etc.)
2. All valid timezone names still work correctly
3. The issue only manifests when users provide invalid Unicode timezone names
4. Oracle will catch and reject invalid names anyway (just with worse errors)
5. This has likely been in Django for years without major complaints

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code comment explicitly promises specific behavior that isn't delivered
- Poor error messages from Oracle make debugging harder for users
- The fix is trivial and improves validation quality

## Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The regex does match "all time zone names from the zoneinfo database" (no false negatives)
2. Being overly permissive isn't technically "wrong" if all valid inputs work

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The comment implies the regex ONLY matches valid timezone names
- Accepting invalid Unicode characters contradicts reasonable expectations
- The bug report correctly identifies a mismatch between intent and implementation

## Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code works but the comment is misleading
2. Could update the comment to say "matches all valid timezone names and more"
3. The actual functionality isn't broken, just the description

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is what's wrong, not the documentation
- The comment correctly describes the INTENDED behavior
- Fixing the regex is more appropriate than changing the documentation

## Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could frame this as "add stricter timezone validation"
2. The current validation "works" but could be enhanced

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a bug where implementation doesn't match documented intent
- The comment establishes what the regex SHOULD do
- Not a new feature, but fixing existing incorrect behavior

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

This is a **BUG**. The decisive factors are:

1. **Clear Intent vs Implementation Mismatch**: The code comment explicitly states the regex "matches all time zone names from the zoneinfo database." This establishes clear intent that the regex should validate timezone names against the zoneinfo/IANA standard.

2. **Verifiable Incorrectness**: The regex accepts thousands of Unicode characters that are NOT part of any valid timezone name. This is objectively incorrect behavior based on the stated intent.

3. **User Impact**: Invalid timezone names pass Django validation but fail at the Oracle level with confusing error messages. Users don't get proper validation feedback.

4. **Not Just Overly Permissive**: If there was no comment claiming specific behavior, this might be WONTFIX. But the comment creates an explicit contract that the code violates.

5. **Simple, Clear Fix**: The solution is straightforward and unambiguous - replace \w with [a-zA-Z0-9_] to match only ASCII word characters as intended.

This is not a documentation issue (the doc/comment is correct), not a missing feature (the validation exists but is wrong), and not trivial enough for WONTFIX (it affects user experience and violates documented behavior).
