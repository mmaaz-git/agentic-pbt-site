DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR check_csrf_failure_view
===================================================

1. Function Purpose and Location:
---------------------------------
The `check_csrf_failure_view` function is located in django/core/checks/security/csrf.py and is part of Django's security check system. It's a registered check that validates the CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW setting.

2. Expected Behavior from Code:
-------------------------------
Looking at the source code (lines 45-67 of csrf.py), the function is designed to:
- Import the view specified by settings.CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW using _get_failure_view()
- Check that the imported view has the correct signature (accepts 'reason' parameter)
- Return a list of Error objects if there are problems

The function explicitly catches ImportError at line 52 and returns an Error with ID "security.E102" saying "The CSRF failure view '%s' could not be imported."

3. _get_failure_view Implementation:
------------------------------------
The _get_failure_view function (in django/middleware/csrf.py) simply calls:
```python
return get_callable(settings.CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW)
```

4. get_callable Behavior:
-------------------------
The get_callable function (in django/urls/utils.py) can raise TWO types of exceptions for import problems:
- ImportError: When the module itself cannot be imported (line 27, 41)
- ViewDoesNotExist: When:
  a) The module exists but the attribute doesn't exist (line 46-48)
  b) The attribute exists but is not callable (line 52-55)
  c) The parent module doesn't exist for nested imports (line 36-38)
  d) The value is not a string or not callable (line 21-23)

5. Documentation Implications:
------------------------------
The check_csrf_failure_view function only catches ImportError but NOT ViewDoesNotExist. This is a clear oversight because:

a) Both exceptions indicate the same type of configuration error - the specified view cannot be imported/used
b) The error message at line 54-55 says "could not be imported" which is appropriate for BOTH cases
c) The Django check system is designed to catch configuration errors and report them gracefully, not crash

6. Django Check System Design Principles:
-----------------------------------------
Django's check framework (as described in Django documentation) is meant to validate configuration and report problems without crashing. Security checks in particular should:
- Run during deployment checks
- Return lists of Error/Warning objects
- Never raise unhandled exceptions for configuration problems

The fact that check_csrf_failure_view can raise an unhandled ViewDoesNotExist exception violates these design principles. The check system should catch all import-related exceptions and convert them to Error objects for proper reporting.

7. Conclusion:
-------------
The documentation and code structure clearly indicate that check_csrf_failure_view should handle ALL exceptions that can be raised by get_callable() when attempting to import the CSRF failure view, not just ImportError. The current behavior where ViewDoesNotExist crashes the check is inconsistent with the Django check framework's design and purpose.
