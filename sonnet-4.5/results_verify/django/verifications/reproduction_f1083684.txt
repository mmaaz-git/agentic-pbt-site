Bug Reproduction Results

1. CODE EXAMINATION:
The bug report correctly identifies the issue in InMemoryStorage._save() (lines 238-253):
- The method opens a file descriptor with `fd = file_node.open(mode)` on line 246
- The fd variable is used to write chunks of data
- The method NEVER calls fd.close() before returning
- This leaves the BytesIO/StringIO object in an open state

2. REPRODUCTION TEST RESULTS:
Running the provided reproduction code confirms:
- File closed: False
- File type: <class '_io.BytesIO'>
- The file remains open after save() completes
- The bug report's claim is technically accurate

3. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
Ran 100 test examples with various content and filenames:
- ALL 100 cases showed file.closed = False
- The behavior is consistent across all test cases
- No edge cases where files were properly closed

4. COMPARISON WITH FILESYSTEM STORAGE:
FileSystemStorage._save() implementation (lines 139-151):
```python
try:
    locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)
    for chunk in content.chunks():
        if _file is None:
            mode = "wb" if isinstance(chunk, bytes) else "wt"
            _file = os.fdopen(fd, mode)
        _file.write(chunk)
finally:
    locks.unlock(fd)
    if _file is not None:
        _file.close()  # <-- Explicitly closes the file
    else:
        os.close(fd)
```
The FileSystemStorage properly uses try/finally to ensure file closure.

5. TECHNICAL IMPACT:
- BytesIO/StringIO are pure Python objects, not OS file descriptors
- They don't consume OS-level resources like real file handles
- Memory is managed by Python's garbage collector
- The "leak" is not an OS resource leak but a Python object state issue

6. ACTUAL BEHAVIOR VS EXPECTED:
- Actual: Files remain with closed=False after save()
- Expected (per bug report): Files should be closed after save()
- FileSystemStorage precedent: Files are closed after save()

The reproduction confirms the technical accuracy of the bug report. The files do remain open (closed=False) after the save operation completes, which is inconsistent with FileSystemStorage's implementation.
