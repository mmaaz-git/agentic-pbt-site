## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in `django.db.backends.utils.truncate_name`. The function violates its documented contract when `hash_len >= length`, producing output that exceeds the specified `length` parameter.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Created a test script that runs both the Hypothesis property test and the specific failing case
2. Confirmed that the Hypothesis test fails with the exact error described in the report
3. Verified the specific failing case: `identifier='00', length=1, hash_len=2`

### Test Results
- **Hypothesis Test**: FAILED with "Truncated name '0b4' has length 3 > 1"
- **Specific Case Output**:
  - Input: `identifier='00', length=1, hash_len=2`
  - Output: `'0b4'` (length 3)
  - Expected: output length <= 1
  - Actual: output length = 3

### Root Cause Analysis
After examining the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py`, I identified the problem in the `truncate_name` function (lines 283-301):

```python
def truncate_name(identifier, length=None, hash_len=4):
    namespace, name = split_identifier(identifier)

    if length is None or len(name) <= length:
        return identifier

    digest = names_digest(name, length=hash_len)
    return "%s%s%s" % (
        '%s"."' % namespace if namespace else "",
        name[: length - hash_len],  # This is problematic when hash_len >= length
        digest,
    )
```

The issue occurs at line 299: `name[: length - hash_len]`
- When `hash_len >= length`, this produces a negative or zero slice index
- Python handles negative slices by returning an empty string or a prefix from the start
- The final result concatenates this with the digest, making the output longer than `length`

For the failing case:
- `length = 1`, `hash_len = 2`
- `name[: 1 - 2]` = `name[: -1]` = `'0'` (everything except the last character)
- `digest = 'b4'` (first 2 chars of MD5 hash)
- Final result: `'0' + 'b4' = '0b4'` (length 3, exceeds the requested length of 1)

### Impact
This bug causes the function to violate its documented contract of producing identifiers no longer than the specified `length`. This could lead to:
1. Database errors when identifiers exceed maximum allowed lengths
2. Unexpected behavior in systems that rely on the length constraint
3. Potential data truncation or corruption in database operations

### Verification
The bug is consistently reproducible and represents a clear violation of the function's documented behavior.
