Documentation Analysis for Django Settings and UserSettingsHolder
================================================================

After reviewing Django's documentation and source code, here are the key findings:

1. Django Documentation Requirements:
   - The Django documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/settings/ explicitly states:
     "Setting names must be all uppercase."
   - This is a clear and unambiguous requirement for Django settings naming convention.

2. LazySettings.configure() Implementation:
   - The source code in django/conf/__init__.py (lines 121-122) enforces this requirement:
     ```python
     if not name.isupper():
         raise TypeError("Setting %r must be uppercase." % name)
     ```
   - This validation occurs when users call settings.configure() with custom settings.

3. UserSettingsHolder Class:
   - The UserSettingsHolder class is described in the source as "Holder for user configured settings" (line 218).
   - It is used internally by LazySettings.configure() to store user-provided settings (line 119).
   - The class has a __getattr__ method (lines 232-235) that checks if names are uppercase:
     ```python
     def __getattr__(self, name):
         if not name.isupper() or name in self._deleted:
             raise AttributeError
         return getattr(self.default_settings, name)
     ```
   - However, the __setattr__ method (lines 237-244) does NOT enforce uppercase validation:
     ```python
     def __setattr__(self, name, value):
         self._deleted.discard(name)
         if name == "FORMS_URLFIELD_ASSUME_HTTPS":
             warnings.warn(...)
         super().__setattr__(name, value)
     ```

4. Settings Class Implementation:
   - The Settings class (used for loading settings from a module) also enforces uppercase (lines 176-177):
     ```python
     for setting in dir(mod):
         if setting.isupper():
     ```
   - It only processes uppercase settings from the settings module.

5. Documentation Completeness:
   - The UserSettingsHolder class is not explicitly documented in the public Django documentation.
   - It appears to be an internal implementation detail used by the settings system.
   - The uppercase requirement is consistently documented for Django settings in general.
