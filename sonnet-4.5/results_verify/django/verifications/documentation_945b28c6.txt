## Documentation Analysis

### Official Django Documentation

I reviewed the official Django documentation for database settings, specifically focusing on the TEST configuration:

1. **Django Settings Documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#test)**
   - The TEST setting is explicitly documented as being a dictionary
   - Default value is stated as: `{}`
   - All examples show TEST as a dictionary containing various configuration options

2. **Database Configuration Documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#databases)**
   - Shows TEST as a dictionary in all examples
   - Lists multiple valid dictionary keys for TEST (NAME, CHARSET, COLLATION, MIGRATE, etc.)
   - No mention of any other valid data types for TEST

### Documentation Requirements

The documentation clearly states and demonstrates that:
- TEST is a dictionary of settings for test databases
- It has specific documented keys like NAME, CHARSET, COLLATION, MIGRATE, MIRROR
- All examples consistently show TEST as a dictionary
- The default value is an empty dictionary `{}`

### User Expectations Based on Documentation

Based on the documentation, users should expect:
1. TEST to be a dictionary (or omitted, which defaults to {})
2. Any non-dictionary value should be considered invalid configuration

### Validation and Error Messages

The documentation does not explicitly state what happens if TEST is set to a non-dictionary value. However, given that:
- The documentation consistently refers to TEST as a dictionary
- All examples use dictionary format
- The default is a dictionary
- All sub-settings are documented as dictionary keys

It is reasonable to expect that Django should either:
1. Validate that TEST is a dictionary and provide a clear error message
2. Handle non-dictionary values gracefully by converting or ignoring them

The current behavior (AttributeError with no clear indication of the configuration problem) does not meet reasonable user expectations based on the documentation.
