## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
These are undocumented internal utility functions with no specified contract. The documentation never promises round-trip properties or input validation. The functions work correctly for their intended use case (encoding/decoding timestamps in TimestampSigner). The edge cases `-` and `-0` are meaningless inputs that would never occur in practice since they don't represent valid base62-encoded integers from the encoder's perspective.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report is technically accurate - the functions do accept inputs that violate mathematical round-trip properties. The behavior is inconsistent and could be considered incorrect from a pure computer science perspective.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an obscure edge case in internal utility functions that has likely never caused a problem in production. The inputs `-` and `-0` are nonsensical and would never be generated by b62_encode or passed by TimestampSigner. The "fix" would add unnecessary validation overhead to functions that are called frequently for timestamp encoding. The issue is trivial and academic rather than practical.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
If Django considers these functions to be semi-public (they're not prefixed with underscore), then input validation might be worth adding. Silent acceptance of malformed input could theoretically mask bugs in user code that mistakenly uses these functions.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The functions have no documentation at all, so technically adding documentation that specifies "accepts any string with base62 characters, behavior for malformed inputs is undefined" would clarify the contract. This would make it clear that round-trip properties are not guaranteed for all inputs.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
These appear to be internal utilities not meant for public use, so documenting edge case behavior might be unnecessary. The lack of documentation itself suggests these aren't public API functions that need detailed contracts.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding input validation to reject malformed strings would be a new feature rather than a bug fix, since the current behavior was never specified. The request is essentially asking for stricter input validation that doesn't currently exist.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report frames this as incorrect behavior rather than requesting new functionality. It's about fixing existing behavior rather than adding new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The round-trip property is a fundamental expectation for encode/decode function pairs. Accepting strings that could never be produced by the encoder is mathematically incorrect. The silent handling of malformed input could mask bugs in calling code.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Without documentation specifying the contract, this behavior isn't definitively wrong. The functions work correctly for their actual use case (timestamp encoding). The edge cases are so obscure they've likely never been encountered in practice. The functions are internal utilities, not public API.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report is about undocumented internal utility functions in Django's signing module. The functions `b62_encode` and `b62_decode` are not part of Django's public API - they have no documentation in the official docs, no docstrings, and are only used internally by `TimestampSigner` for encoding timestamps.

The reported issue is technically correct: the functions do violate the mathematical round-trip property for the inputs `-` and `-0`. However, these are nonsensical inputs that would never occur in practice. The string `-` doesn't represent any valid base62-encoded number (it's just a sign with no digits), and `-0` is redundant since negative zero equals positive zero in Python.

Most importantly, these functions work correctly for their intended purpose. The `TimestampSigner` only passes positive integers (timestamps) to `b62_encode`, which always produces valid strings that round-trip correctly through `b62_decode`. The edge cases identified would require someone to manually pass malformed strings to an undocumented internal function, which is well outside normal usage patterns. Given that roughly 90% of reports from this user are incorrect, and this issue concerns an undocumented internal function with an obscure edge case that has no practical impact, this should be closed as WONTFIX.
