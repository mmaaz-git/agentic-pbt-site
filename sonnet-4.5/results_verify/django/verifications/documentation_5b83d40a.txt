## Documentation Analysis

### ProgressBar Documentation
The ProgressBar class in django.core.serializers.base.py has no explicit documentation beyond the code itself. It's an internal utility class used for showing progress during serialization operations.

### Class Analysis
```python
class ProgressBar:
    progress_width = 75

    def __init__(self, output, total_count):
        self.output = output
        self.total_count = total_count
        self.prev_done = 0

    def update(self, count):
        if not self.output:
            return
        perc = count * 100 // self.total_count  # Line 59: Division by zero issue
        done = perc * self.progress_width // 100
        # ... rest of method
```

### Key Observations

1. **No Documentation on Edge Cases**: There is no documentation (docstrings or comments) that specifies how ProgressBar should behave when `total_count` is 0.

2. **Real-World Usage**: The dumpdata command (django/core/management/commands/dumpdata.py) demonstrates that `object_count` can be 0:
   - Line 235: `object_count = sum(get_objects(count_only=True))`
   - This sum can be 0 when serializing an empty database or empty models

3. **Progress Bar Purpose**: The progress bar is meant to show serialization progress. When there are 0 objects to serialize, showing progress doesn't make logical sense, but the code should handle this gracefully rather than crashing.

4. **No Contract Specification**: There's no documented contract or specification that says ProgressBar must handle zero counts, but neither does it say it shouldn't. The lack of defensive programming for this edge case appears to be an oversight.

5. **Django's Serialization Documentation**: The official Django documentation for serialization (checked online) doesn't mention progress bars or how empty datasets should be handled. The ProgressBar appears to be an internal implementation detail.

### Expected Behavior
Given that:
- The ProgressBar is used internally by Django's serialization framework
- The dumpdata command can legitimately have 0 objects to serialize
- There's no documentation saying zero counts are invalid

The reasonable expectation is that ProgressBar should handle `total_count=0` gracefully without crashing. Either:
1. Skip updating when total_count is 0 (as the proposed fix does)
2. Show a completed or empty progress bar
3. Not create a progress bar at all when count is 0

The current behavior (crashing with ZeroDivisionError) is clearly unintended and represents a bug.
