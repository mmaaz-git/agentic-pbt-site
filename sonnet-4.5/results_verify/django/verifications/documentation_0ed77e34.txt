DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR DICTIONARYSERIALIZER

1. Source Code Documentation:
The DictionarySerializer class in django/db/migrations/serializer.py has NO documentation or docstring whatsoever. The class inherits from BaseSerializer and implements only a serialize() method.

2. Implementation Details from Code:
Looking at line 129 in serializer.py, the serialize() method attempts to sort dictionary items using:
```python
for k, v in sorted(self.value.items()):
```

This is done to create deterministic output for migrations. The sorting is performed directly on the items without any key function, which means Python's default comparison operators (<, >, ==) are used between the dictionary keys.

3. Django's Official Documentation:
The Django documentation mentions migration serialization at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/migrations/#migration-serializing but does NOT specify:
- What types of dictionary keys are supported
- Whether mixed-type dictionaries should be supported
- Any constraints on dictionary key types
- The requirement for deterministic ordering

4. Python Language Behavior:
In Python 3, comparing incompatible types (like int and str) with < or > raises a TypeError. This is a well-known Python 3 behavior change from Python 2 where such comparisons were allowed (though arbitrary).

5. Usage Context:
The DictionarySerializer is registered in the Serializer._registry to handle all dict type objects when serializing values for Django migrations. This means any dictionary that appears in a Django model field definition, migration operation, or other migration-serializable context will use this serializer.

6. No Explicit Constraints:
There is NO documentation that states:
- Dictionaries must have homogeneous key types
- Mixed-type dictionaries are unsupported
- Any warnings about TypeError when using mixed-type keys

7. Valid Python Dictionaries:
Dictionaries with mixed key types like {0: 'value', 'key': 'value'} are completely valid in Python and commonly used in various contexts. The Python language itself imposes no restriction on mixing key types in dictionaries.
