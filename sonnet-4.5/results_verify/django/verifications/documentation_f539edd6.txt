## Documentation Analysis

### Django Documentation Findings

1. **Storage Backend Contract**: The Django documentation describes the Storage class as providing a "standardized API for storing files" with methods like save(), open(), delete(), exists(), etc. However, it does not explicitly specify that all storage backends must behave identically in all aspects.

2. **Text File Handling**: The Django documentation for FileSystemStorage and InMemoryStorage does not mention anything specific about text file handling or line ending preservation. The open() method is documented with a default mode of 'rb' (binary read), but there's no documentation about what happens in text mode.

3. **Backend Equivalence**: While the documentation implies that storage backends should implement a consistent interface, it doesn't explicitly guarantee identical behavior for all operations, especially regarding text mode file handling.

### Python Documentation Findings

Python's open() function documentation clearly explains the newline behavior:

1. **Default Behavior**: When opening files in text mode with newline=None (the default), Python enables "universal newline mode" which automatically converts all line endings (\r, \r\n) to \n.

2. **Preserving Line Endings**: To preserve original line endings, Python requires passing newline='' to the open() function.

3. **The Issue**: FileSystemStorage uses Python's open() without any newline parameter, thus getting the default universal newline translation. InMemoryStorage doesn't use Python's open() and preserves line endings.

### Documentation Gaps

1. **Unspecified Behavior**: Django's documentation doesn't specify whether storage backends should preserve line endings in text mode or apply universal newline translation.

2. **Missing Contract**: There's no documented contract about whether different storage backends should behave identically regarding text file content transformation.

3. **Implicit Expectations**: While not explicitly documented, there's a reasonable expectation that storage systems should preserve file content exactly as saved (round-trip property), and that swappable backends should behave consistently.

### Conclusion

The bug report identifies a real inconsistency between two storage implementations, but the Django documentation doesn't explicitly specify what the correct behavior should be. This could be considered:

1. A bug - if we assume storage backends should behave identically and preserve content
2. A documentation issue - if the current behavior is intended but not properly documented
3. An implementation detail - if backends are allowed to have different behaviors

The most reasonable interpretation is that this is a bug because:
- Storage systems are generally expected to preserve data without modification
- The inconsistency between backends breaks the substitutability principle
- The silent modification of data could lead to unexpected issues in production
