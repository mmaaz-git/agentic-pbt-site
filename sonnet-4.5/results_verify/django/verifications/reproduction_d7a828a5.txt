## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results
I successfully reproduced the bug using both the property-based test and manual reproduction code:

1. **Property-based test with `policy_values=[' ']`**:
   - String input `' '` produces header: `''` (empty string after stripping)
   - List input `[' ']` produces header: `' '` (single space preserved)
   - These are different, confirming the inconsistency

2. **Manual test with `[' no-referrer ', '  strict-origin']`**:
   - String input produces: `'no-referrer,strict-origin'` (whitespace stripped)
   - List input produces: `' no-referrer ,  strict-origin'` (whitespace preserved)
   - Again, these are different

### Code Analysis
Looking at the SecurityMiddleware implementation (lines 54-58):
```python
",".join(
    [v.strip() for v in self.referrer_policy.split(",")]
    if isinstance(self.referrer_policy, str)
    else self.referrer_policy
)
```

The code:
- For strings: splits on comma and strips whitespace from each value
- For iterables: uses values as-is without any stripping

### Impact Assessment
This inconsistency has several implications:

1. **Invalid HTTP Headers**: When using a list with whitespace, the resulting header may contain invalid policy tokens. For example, `" no-referrer "` is not a valid policy token according to the specification.

2. **User Confusion**: Users might reasonably expect `["no-referrer", "strict-origin"]` and `"no-referrer, strict-origin"` to produce identical results, especially if one contains accidental whitespace.

3. **Browser Behavior**: Browsers may handle invalid policy tokens differently. Some might ignore them, others might reject the entire header.

### Technical Details Verified
- The bug report's code runs correctly
- The failing inputs produce the exact outputs claimed in the report
- The inconsistency is reproducible and deterministic
- The proposed fix would make the handling consistent by stripping whitespace in both cases
