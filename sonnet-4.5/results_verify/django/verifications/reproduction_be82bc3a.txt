## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution

I successfully reproduced the reported bug using both the property-based test and the direct reproduction code.

### Property-Based Test Results

The hypothesis test failed as expected with the assertion:
```
AssertionError: BUG: Slash-only prefix '/' creates catch-all regex: ^(?P<path>.*)$
```

This confirms that when `num_slashes=1` (or any positive integer), the function creates a catch-all pattern.

### Direct Reproduction Results

When testing with prefix="/":
- The resulting regex pattern is: `^(?P<path>.*)$`
- This pattern matches ALL paths tested:
  - 'media/file.jpg' matches: True
  - 'admin/login' matches: True
  - 'api/users' matches: True
  - '' (empty string) matches: True

### Additional Testing

1. **Multiple slashes** ('/', '//', '///', etc.):
   - ALL produce the same catch-all pattern: `^(?P<path>.*)$`
   - After `lstrip('/')`, they all become an empty string ''

2. **Valid prefixes for comparison**:
   - '/media/' produces: `^media/(?P<path>.*)$` (correctly scoped)
   - 'static/' produces: `^static/(?P<path>.*)$` (correctly scoped)
   - '/assets/' produces: `^assets/(?P<path>.*)$` (correctly scoped)

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs due to this sequence:
1. Input: prefix = "/" (or multiple slashes)
2. Validation: `if not prefix:` - This check passes because "/" is truthy
3. Processing: `prefix.lstrip("/")` returns an empty string ""
4. Pattern creation: `re.escape("")` returns ""
5. Final pattern: `r"^%s(?P<path>.*)$" % ""` becomes `^(?P<path>.*)$`

This creates a regex that matches ANY string, effectively making the static file handler intercept ALL URLs in the application.

### Impact Verification

The bug is real and has serious implications:
- A developer accidentally using "/" as a prefix would have their static file handler match ALL URLs
- This would break normal URL routing, as the static handler would capture everything
- The bug is silent - no error is raised, making it difficult to diagnose

The reported behavior matches exactly what the code does, and the impact is as severe as described.
