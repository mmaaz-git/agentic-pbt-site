## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This could be invalid if Django intentionally uses 'az' to represent South Azerbaijani (used in Iran) which still uses Arabic script and is RTL. The documentation doesn't explicitly specify which variant of Azerbaijani 'az' represents, so there's no clear specification being violated. Additionally, since Azerbaijani can be written in multiple scripts with different directions, marking it as bidi=True might be a conservative choice to support the RTL variant.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The name_local field clearly shows "Azərbaycanca" written in Latin script with the specific characters (ə, ç) that are part of the modern Azerbaijani Latin alphabet adopted in 1991. This strongly indicates that 'az' is meant to represent the official Azerbaijani of the Republic of Azerbaijan, not the Iranian variant. If Django meant to support the Arabic script variant, the name_local would likely be in Arabic script like all other RTL languages in the list.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be WONTFIX if Django considers this a legacy decision that, while technically incorrect, has been in place for so long that changing it might break existing applications that have worked around this issue. Some developers might have already implemented custom handling for Azerbaijani expecting it to be RTL, and fixing this could cause more problems than it solves.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a clear data error that causes actual rendering problems for any Django application serving content in Azerbaijani. The issue directly affects user experience by applying wrong text direction, which is not a trivial concern. Other Django users would benefit from having correct locale data, and the fix is straightforward - just changing one boolean value.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This could be a documentation issue if Django intended 'az' to represent the Arabic-script variant of Azerbaijani but failed to document this clearly. The documentation could be updated to clarify that 'az' represents South Azerbaijani (Iran) with Arabic script, and developers needing Latin-script Azerbaijani should use a different locale code or implement custom handling.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The name_local "Azərbaycanca" is definitively Latin script, using the exact orthography of the Republic of Azerbaijan's official alphabet. This isn't ambiguous - it's clearly the Latin variant. If documentation needed to be fixed, it would be to explain why the Latin-script name is used with RTL direction, which doesn't make logical sense.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This could be a feature request if Django currently only supports one variant of Azerbaijani and the request is to add proper support for distinguishing between North Azerbaijani (az-Latn) and South Azerbaijani (az-Arab). The current single 'az' code might be insufficient to handle both variants properly, requiring new locale codes.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but pointing out that existing data is incorrect. The 'az' locale already exists with Latin script name_local, indicating it should be LTR. The bug report isn't requesting support for multiple variants but stating that the current single variant has the wrong directionality setting.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This appears to be a clear bug because: (1) The name_local "Azərbaycanca" is written in Latin script, the only such case among all bidi=True languages, (2) The Republic of Azerbaijan officially uses Latin script since 1991 and it's LTR, (3) All other RTL languages in Django show their name_local in actual RTL scripts (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.), (4) The bidi=True setting will cause incorrect text rendering for Azerbaijani content, affecting actual users, (5) The fix is simple and objective - Latin script is always LTR.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only reason this might not be a bug is if Django has an undocumented intention to use 'az' for the Arabic-script variant despite using Latin script in name_local. However, this would be internally inconsistent and there's no evidence supporting this interpretation.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at all the evidence, this appears to be a legitimate bug. The most compelling evidence is that Azerbaijani is the only language marked as bidi=True that has its name_local written in Latin script. Every other RTL language in Django's LANG_INFO shows its name_local in the actual RTL script it uses (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.). The name "Azərbaycanca" with its distinctive Latin characters (ə, ç) is unambiguously the modern Azerbaijani Latin alphabet adopted by the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1991.

While Azerbaijani can historically be written in Arabic script (and still is in Iran), the Django locale entry clearly represents the Latin-script variant based on the name_local field. Having bidi=True for Latin script text will cause actual rendering issues in Django applications, with text appearing right-to-left when it should be left-to-right. This isn't a theoretical problem but a practical bug affecting text display.

The fact that no documentation explicitly states which Azerbaijani variant 'az' represents doesn't make this invalid - the name_local field serves as implicit documentation by using Latin script. If Django intended to support the Arabic-script variant, consistency would demand using Arabic script in name_local, as is done for every other RTL language. Therefore, this should be categorized as a BUG requiring a simple fix: changing bidi from True to False for the 'az' locale.
