REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I successfully reproduced the bug as reported. The issue occurs when using Django's Signal class with `use_caching=True`.

Test Results:
-------------

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test failed exactly as described when `use_caching=True` was passed:
   - Error: `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'NoneType' object`
   - Location: `dispatcher.py` line 425 in `_live_receivers` method
   - The test passes when `use_caching=False`

2. **Direct Reproduction Case 1**: Calling `has_listeners()` with default `sender=None`:
   - With `use_caching=True`: CRASHES with `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'NoneType' object`
   - With `use_caching=False`: Works correctly, returns `True`

3. **Direct Reproduction Case 2**: Calling `send(sender=object())`:
   - With `use_caching=True`: CRASHES with `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'object' object`
   - With `use_caching=False`: Works correctly, returns the list of receivers and responses

4. **Additional Testing**: Also tested `send(sender=None)`:
   - With `use_caching=True`: CRASHES with same TypeError
   - With `use_caching=False`: Works correctly

Root Cause Confirmed:
--------------------
The bug occurs at line 47 in `dispatcher.py` where a `weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()` is created when `use_caching=True`. This dictionary type cannot accept non-weakref-able objects as keys. Python's weakref module cannot create weak references to:
- `None`
- Basic `object()` instances
- Integers, strings, and other built-in immutable types

When these types are used as senders, the code crashes when trying to:
1. Get from cache: `self.sender_receivers_cache.get(sender)` (line 425)
2. Set in cache: `self.sender_receivers_cache[sender] = ...` (lines 440, 443)

The bug is 100% reproducible and occurs in real-world Django usage since Django's own model signals use `use_caching=True` (verified in `django/db/models/signals.py` lines 42-51).
