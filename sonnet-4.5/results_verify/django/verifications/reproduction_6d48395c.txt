Bug Reproduction Results
========================

The bug report has been successfully reproduced and verified. Here are the technical details:

1. Reproduction Test Results:
   - The test case provided in the bug report runs correctly and demonstrates the issue.
   - When setting a lowercase attribute on UserSettingsHolder directly: SUCCEEDS (should fail)
   - When using LazySettings.configure() with lowercase setting: FAILS with TypeError (correct behavior)
   - This confirms the inconsistency described in the bug report.

2. Specific Test Case (setting_name='a'):
   - Setting holder.a = "test_value" works without error
   - Retrieving holder.a returns "test_value" successfully
   - This violates the uppercase requirement for Django settings

3. Behavior Analysis:
   - UserSettingsHolder.__setattr__ allows any attribute name (including lowercase)
   - The lowercase attribute is stored in holder.__dict__
   - Direct attribute access (holder.lowercase_setting) retrieves the value from __dict__
   - UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__ correctly rejects lowercase (but is only called for missing attributes)
   - LazySettings.configure() correctly validates and rejects lowercase settings

4. The Issue:
   The bug report accurately identifies an inconsistency:
   - LazySettings.configure() enforces uppercase validation before calling setattr on UserSettingsHolder
   - UserSettingsHolder.__setattr__ itself does not enforce this validation
   - This creates a situation where:
     a) Using the public API (settings.configure()) enforces uppercase
     b) Using UserSettingsHolder directly bypasses this validation

5. Impact Assessment:
   - UserSettingsHolder is typically used internally by Django
   - However, it is accessible and could be instantiated directly
   - This creates an inconsistency in the settings contract enforcement
   - The __getattr__ method tries to enforce uppercase but only for fallback to default_settings
   - Once a lowercase attribute is set, it lives in __dict__ and bypasses __getattr__ completely

The bug report's technical details are correct and the issue is reproducible.
