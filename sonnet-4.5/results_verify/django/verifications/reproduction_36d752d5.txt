BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

## Summary
The bug report is technically correct. The cache can indeed exceed its configured max_entries limit.

## Test Results

### Bug Reproduction Test
The exact scenario from the bug report was reproduced:
- Created LocMemCache with max_entries=1, cull_frequency=3
- Added two items to the cache
- Result: Cache size became 2, exceeding max_entries of 1
- This confirms the bug exists as described

### Root Cause Verification
The culling calculation was verified:
- When len(cache) < cull_frequency, integer division results in 0
- Example: 1 // 3 = 0, 2 // 3 = 0
- When count = 0, the _cull() method removes 0 items
- The new item is then added, causing cache to exceed max_entries

### Systematic Testing
Multiple combinations of max_entries and cull_frequency were tested:
- (1, 2): Cache exceeded max_entries
- (1, 3): Cache exceeded max_entries
- (1, 4): Cache exceeded max_entries
- (2, 3): Cache exceeded max_entries
- (2, 4): Cache exceeded max_entries
- (3, 4): Cache exceeded max_entries

All cases where max_entries < cull_frequency resulted in the cache exceeding its limit.

### Hypothesis Test
The property-based test from the bug report was run:
- Test failed on first example with max_entries=1, extra=1
- This confirms the bug is reproducible with the provided test

### Fix Verification
The proposed fix (using max(1, len(cache) // cull_frequency)) was tested:
- With the fix applied, all test cases passed
- Cache no longer exceeded max_entries in any scenario
- The fix ensures at least one item is always culled when needed

## Technical Details

The bug occurs in the interaction between _set() and _cull():

1. _set() checks if len(cache) >= max_entries
2. If true, it calls _cull() before adding the new item
3. _cull() calculates: count = len(cache) // cull_frequency
4. When this integer division results in 0, no items are removed
5. The new item is added anyway, exceeding max_entries

The proposed fix ensures that when culling is triggered, at least one item is always removed, preventing the cache from exceeding its configured limit.
