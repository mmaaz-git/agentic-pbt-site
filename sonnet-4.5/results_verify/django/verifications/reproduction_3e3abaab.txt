REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
The bug report claims that static() has incomplete prefix validation - it rejects empty strings
but allows slash-only strings like "/" which become empty after lstrip("/") processing.

REPRODUCTION RESULTS:

1. BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED:
   - static('') raises ImproperlyConfigured: "Empty static prefix not permitted" ✓
   - static('/') does NOT raise an error and returns pattern: ^(?P<path>.*)$ ✓
   - static('//') does NOT raise an error and returns pattern: ^(?P<path>.*)$ ✓
   - static('///') does NOT raise an error and returns pattern: ^(?P<path>.*)$ ✓

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
   The hypothesis test FAILED as expected by the bug report.
   When testing slash-only strings, the function does NOT raise ImproperlyConfigured.
   Instead, it returns a URLPattern with regex ^(?P<path>.*)$

3. PATTERN ANALYSIS:
   - Normal prefix '/media/' produces: ^media/(?P<path>.*)$
   - Slash-only prefix '/' produces: ^(?P<path>.*)$

   The pattern ^(?P<path>.*)$ will match ANY path, which is significantly broader than intended.
   This is functionally equivalent to having no prefix at all.

4. LSTRIP BEHAVIOR VERIFIED:
   '/'.lstrip('/') = ''
   '//'.lstrip('/') = ''
   '///'.lstrip('/') = ''

   All slash-only strings become empty strings after lstrip('/').

5. INCONSISTENCY CONFIRMED:
   The validation at line 21 checks: if not prefix
   This catches '' but not '/', '//', etc.

   After lstrip('/') at line 28, these all become empty, creating the same pattern
   that an empty prefix would have created (if it were allowed).

TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
The bug report is technically accurate in all its claims:
- The code does check for empty prefix
- The code does process prefix.lstrip("/")
- Slash-only prefixes do bypass the validation
- The resulting pattern does match all paths
- This creates an inconsistency in the validation logic
