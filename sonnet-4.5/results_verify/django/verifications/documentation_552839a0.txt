## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation

From the Django source code docstring for `do_get_language_info_list` (lines 594-609 of i18n.py):

```
Store a list of language information dictionaries for the given language
codes in a context variable. The language codes can be specified either as
a list of strings or a settings.LANGUAGES style list (or any sequence of
sequences whose first items are language codes).
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Explicitly Documented Input Types**:
   - List of strings (language codes): `["en", "es", "fr"]`
   - settings.LANGUAGES style list: `[("en", "English"), ("es", "Spanish")]`
   - "any sequence of sequences whose first items are language codes"

2. **The Documentation Explicitly States**:
   The documentation EXPLICITLY says the function should accept "any sequence of sequences whose first items are language codes". This is crucial because it means sequences like `['x', 'Unknown Language']` are explicitly intended to be supported.

3. **Comment in get_language_info() Method**:
   Lines 41-42 of the source contain a comment:
   ```python
   # ``language`` is either a language code string or a sequence
   # with the language code as its first item
   ```
   This comment confirms the intended behavior: the method should handle both strings and sequences.

### Documentation vs. Implementation

The documentation and code comments clearly state that:
1. The function should accept sequences where the first item is the language code
2. There is NO requirement that the language code must be more than one character
3. The documentation does not say "sequences whose first items are multi-character language codes"

### Examples from Django Docs

The Django documentation shows examples like:
```django
{% get_language_info_list for LANGUAGES as langs %}
```

Where LANGUAGES could be:
- `[("en", "English"), ("es", "Spanish")]` - works currently
- `[("x", "Custom"), ("y", "Other")]` - SHOULD work per docs but fails

### Conclusion

The documentation explicitly states that the function should handle "any sequence of sequences whose first items are language codes" without any restriction on the length of those language codes. The current implementation violates this documented behavior by failing on sequences with single-character first elements.

The bug report correctly identifies a discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual implementation. The code fails to implement what the documentation promises.
