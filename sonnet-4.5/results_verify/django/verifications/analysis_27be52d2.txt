## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior is technically working as designed - Python's string.format() method raises a KeyError when a placeholder doesn't match a key in the provided dictionary, and Django is simply passing through this standard Python behavior. The documentation mentions that success_url uses dictionary string formatting against the object's field attributes, which implies developers should ensure placeholders match. Additionally, this is a developer configuration error, not a runtime data issue - developers should test their views and would immediately discover mismatched placeholders during development.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The error occurs exactly as reported in the bug, and the current behavior makes debugging unnecessarily difficult. Django typically provides helpful error messages for configuration issues (via ImproperlyConfigured), and this bare KeyError is inconsistent with Django's usual developer-friendly approach. The documentation doesn't explicitly warn about this error case or explain what happens with mismatched placeholders.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This issue only occurs during development when developers make typos or configuration errors, not in production with valid configurations. The error is immediately obvious when testing the view, so developers will catch it quickly. The fix would add a try/except block that has a small performance cost for every successful deletion, just to handle developer errors. The current behavior has existed for years without being a major pain point for the Django community.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Django prides itself on helpful error messages and good developer experience. This is a simple fix that would make debugging easier without breaking backward compatibility. The performance cost of a try/except block is negligible compared to the database operations involved in deletion. Similar error handling already exists elsewhere in Django (e.g., template variable resolution).

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code is working as intended - it's using Python's standard string formatting which naturally raises KeyError for missing keys. The real issue is that the documentation doesn't explicitly warn developers about ensuring placeholder names match object attributes. Adding a note to the documentation about this requirement would help developers avoid the issue without changing any code behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
While documentation could be improved, the underlying issue is that the error message is unhelpful when it does occur. Even with better documentation, developers will still make typos and face cryptic KeyError messages. The proposed code fix would provide a much better developer experience than just documenting the current limitation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is requesting an enhancement to error handling rather than fixing broken functionality. The current behavior works correctly for valid configurations, and the request is to add better error messages for invalid configurations. This could be seen as a new feature to improve developer experience rather than fixing a bug. The proposed change adds new functionality (better error context) rather than fixing something that's broken.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The inability to provide meaningful error messages for common developer mistakes could be considered a deficiency rather than a missing feature. Other parts of Django already handle similar situations with ImproperlyConfigured exceptions. This is more about fixing an oversight in error handling rather than adding new functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Django consistently uses ImproperlyConfigured exceptions for configuration errors throughout the codebase, and this case incorrectly allows a bare KeyError to bubble up instead. The error provides no context about what went wrong or how to fix it, violating Django's principle of helpful error messages. Both DeletionMixin and ModelFormMixin have this issue, suggesting it's a systematic problem. The fix is simple and wouldn't break backward compatibility while significantly improving developer experience.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The code is working exactly as the Python language specifies - format() raises KeyError for missing keys. The documentation mentions using dictionary formatting, which implies developers should understand Python's formatting behavior. This is a configuration error by the developer, not incorrect behavior by the framework. The error only occurs with invalid configurations that would be caught immediately during development.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at all considerations, this issue sits in a gray area between improving developer experience and fixing an actual bug. Django has a strong tradition of providing helpful error messages, particularly through ImproperlyConfigured exceptions for configuration issues. The current behavior, while technically correct from a Python perspective, is inconsistent with how Django handles similar configuration errors elsewhere in the codebase.

The proposed fix is minimal, backwards-compatible, and would significantly improve the developer experience when debugging configuration issues. The error would change from a cryptic "KeyError: 'category_id'" to something like "ImproperlyConfigured: success_url template contains placeholder 'category_id' not present in object attributes", which immediately tells the developer what's wrong and how to fix it.

However, this is ultimately a developer error that occurs during development, not a runtime issue affecting end users. The current behavior has existed for many years without being a critical problem. While the improvement would be nice to have, it addresses an edge case that developers encounter rarely and can easily debug once they understand the pattern. Given that the bug reporter has a history of mostly incorrect reports and this addresses a marginal developer experience issue rather than actual broken functionality, this leans toward being rejected or reclassified rather than accepted as a bug.
