## Documentation Analysis

### Function Purpose
The get_exception_info() function is documented as:
"Format exception information for display on the debug page using the structure described in the template API documentation."

This is an internal Django utility function specifically designed to extract debugging information from Jinja2 TemplateSyntaxError exceptions for display in Django's debug pages.

### Jinja2 Exception Attributes
According to the Jinja2 documentation, TemplateSyntaxError exceptions have these attributes:
- lineno: An integer representing the line number where the error occurred
- source: The template source code (can be None)
- filename: The filename of the template (can be None)
- message: A string describing the syntax error

### Django's Expectations
The Django code shows that get_exception_info expects to receive a Jinja2 exception object and extract context information around the error location. The function returns a dictionary with:
- Line numbers and ranges (top, bottom, total)
- Source lines around the error
- The specific line where the error occurred ('during')
- Error message and filename

### Documentation Gaps
Neither Django's documentation nor Jinja2's documentation explicitly states:
1. That lineno must be within the valid range of source lines
2. How to handle cases where lineno exceeds the source line count
3. What should happen when lineno is 0 or negative
4. Whether lineno can ever legitimately be out of bounds

### Reasonable Expectations
While not explicitly documented, it is reasonable to expect that:
1. A debugging function should not crash when displaying error information
2. The function should gracefully handle edge cases and malformed input
3. Invalid line numbers could occur due to:
   - Corrupted exception state
   - Bugs in Jinja2's exception reporting
   - Programmatically created mock exceptions (as in tests)
   - Template compilation issues

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify that lineno must be within bounds, nor does it document what should happen when it isn't. However, as a debugging utility, the function should be resilient to invalid input and not crash when trying to display error information. The current behavior (crashing with IndexError) prevents developers from seeing any debug information at all, which defeats the function's purpose.
