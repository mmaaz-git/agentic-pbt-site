## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- Silent data loss is occurring - multiple cookies are being lost without warning
- The function violates RFC 6265 by accepting invalid cookie names
- No documentation warns about this behavior
- Data loss bugs are generally serious issues that should be fixed
- The current behavior could lead to security issues or unexpected application behavior

**Strength:** High - Silent data loss is a classic bug pattern

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Whitespace-only cookie names are explicitly invalid per RFC 6265
- Applications should not be sending such cookies in the first place
- The function could argue it's "garbage in, garbage out"
- The behavior of collapsing invalid input might be considered acceptable

**Strength:** Low - While the input is invalid, silent data loss is still problematic

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- This is an obscure edge case unlikely to occur in practice
- Real applications don't use whitespace-only cookie names
- The performance cost of additional validation might not be worth it
- Breaking changes to cookie parsing could affect existing applications

**Strength:** Medium - Edge case nature makes this a candidate for WONTFIX

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Adding validation for RFC compliance could be seen as a new feature
- The request for explicit error handling or warnings is an enhancement
- Current behavior technically "works" (returns a dictionary)

**Strength:** Low - This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The function lacks documentation about edge case handling
- Could document that invalid cookie names result in data loss
- Could clarify that the function is intentionally permissive

**Strength:** Low - The code behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation

## Analysis Summary:

The core issue is **silent data loss** when processing cookies with whitespace-only names. While such cookies are invalid per RFC 6265, Django's parse_cookie function:

1. Accepts them without validation
2. Strips whitespace, causing key collision
3. Silently discards all but the last value
4. Provides no warning or error

Key factors:
- **Severity**: Data loss without warning is a serious issue
- **RFC Compliance**: The function violates cookie specifications
- **User Impact**: Could cause unexpected behavior in applications
- **Fix Complexity**: Simple to implement (skip invalid cookies or raise error)

While the input is technically invalid, the principle of "fail loudly rather than silently" suggests this should be addressed. The function should either:
1. Skip invalid cookies entirely
2. Raise an exception for invalid input
3. At minimum, warn about the data loss

The silent loss of data makes this a legitimate bug rather than just a documentation issue or edge case.
