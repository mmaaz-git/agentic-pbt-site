## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation (from source code):
The is_same_domain function includes a docstring that states:
```
Return ``True`` if the host is either an exact match or a match
to the wildcard pattern.

Any pattern beginning with a period matches a domain and all of its
subdomains. (e.g. ``.example.com`` matches ``example.com`` and
``foo.example.com``). Anything else is an exact string match.
```

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **No Explicit Case Sensitivity Mention**: The function's docstring does not explicitly state whether domain matching should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive.

2. **RFC 1035 - DNS Standard**: The bug report correctly references RFC 1035, which clearly states:
   - "Name servers and resolvers must compare labels in a case-insensitive manner (i.e., A=a)"
   - This is a fundamental DNS requirement that domain names MUST be compared case-insensitively

3. **Django's Intent**:
   - The function already calls pattern.lower() on line 235, showing clear intent for case-insensitive comparison
   - This partial implementation indicates the developers intended case-insensitive matching
   - The function is used for security-critical features (CORS/CSRF protection, ALLOWED_HOSTS validation)

4. **Usage Context**:
   - The function is used internally by Django for host validation
   - It's part of Django's security infrastructure for validating HTTP Host headers
   - Host headers in HTTP can arrive in any case combination

### Documentation vs Implementation Gap:
- While the docstring doesn't explicitly mention case sensitivity, the DNS standard (RFC 1035) mandates case-insensitive comparison
- The partial implementation (lowercasing only pattern) creates behavior that violates DNS standards
- The asymmetric behavior (works one way but not the other) is clearly unintentional

### Conclusion:
The documentation could be clearer about case sensitivity, but the implementation clearly violates:
1. DNS standards (RFC 1035)
2. The function's own partial implementation intent (already lowercases pattern)
3. Expected behavior for domain matching in web applications
