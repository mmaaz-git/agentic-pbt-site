## Documentation Analysis

### Function Location and Purpose
The `typecast_date` and `typecast_timestamp` functions are located in `django.db.backends.utils.py` and are internal utility functions for Django's database backends. They are part of the "Converters from database (string) to Python" section.

### Documentation Found

1. **In-code Comments**:
   - `typecast_date`: Has comment "# return None if s is null"
   - `typecast_timestamp`: Has comment "# does NOT store time zone information"
   - Both functions are in a section titled "Converters from database (string) to Python"

2. **No Official Public Documentation**:
   - These functions are NOT documented in Django's public API documentation
   - They are internal utility functions not intended for direct user consumption
   - No specification found for expected input formats or error handling behavior

3. **Usage Pattern in Django Codebase**:
   - The SQLite backend (`django/db/backends/sqlite3/_functions.py`) shows the expected usage pattern:
   ```python
   try:
       dt = typecast_timestamp(dt)
   except (TypeError, ValueError):
       return None
   ```
   - This indicates that raising exceptions (TypeError or ValueError) for invalid input is the expected behavior
   - The calling code is responsible for catching and handling these exceptions

4. **Input Format Expectations** (inferred from code):
   - `typecast_date`: Expects strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format (based on `s.split("-")`)
   - `typecast_timestamp`: Expects strings in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.microseconds][+/-TZ]" format
   - Both functions return `None` for empty/null inputs

### Key Observations

1. **These are internal functions**: Not part of Django's public API, used internally by database backends
2. **Error handling is delegated to callers**: The functions are designed to raise exceptions, with callers responsible for catching them
3. **No specification for malformed input**: There is no documented requirement for how these functions should behave with malformed input beyond the empty/null case
4. **Current behavior matches usage pattern**: The SQLite backend expects and handles TypeErrors and ValueErrors from these functions

### Conclusion on Documentation
The lack of public documentation and the internal nature of these functions means that their current exception-raising behavior for malformed input appears to be intentional. The functions are designed to be simple converters that fail fast with exceptions when given invalid input, with the expectation that calling code will handle these exceptions appropriately (as demonstrated by the SQLite backend).
