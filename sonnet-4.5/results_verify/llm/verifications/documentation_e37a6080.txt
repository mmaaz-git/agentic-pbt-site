## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `not_nulls` function in `/llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py` has no explicit documentation. The function signature indicates it takes `data` and returns a `dict`, but there are no docstrings or comments explaining its behavior.

### External Documentation Search
1. **Official LLM Documentation**:
   - No mention of the `not_nulls` function in the public documentation at llm.datasette.io
   - The OpenAI models documentation doesn't describe internal implementation details
   - No documentation about how None values are filtered from options

2. **GitHub Repository**:
   - The main repository README doesn't mention implementation details
   - No specific documentation found about options filtering

### Code Context Analysis
From examining the source code:

1. **Function Purpose** (inferred from usage):
   - Called in `build_kwargs` at line 658: `kwargs = dict(not_nulls(prompt.options))`
   - Intended to filter out None values from the options dictionary
   - The result is used to build kwargs for OpenAI API calls

2. **Input Type Verification**:
   - In `llm/models.py` line 365: `self.options = options or {}`
   - This confirms `prompt.options` is always a dictionary
   - The function is always called with a dict input

3. **Expected Behavior** (based on name and usage):
   - Should take a dictionary as input
   - Should return a dictionary with None values filtered out
   - Should preserve all non-None key-value pairs

### Documentation Implications
Since there is no explicit documentation for this internal function:
- The bug cannot be considered a documentation error
- The function name `not_nulls` clearly implies it filters out null/None values
- The type hint `-> dict` indicates it should return a dictionary
- The usage context confirms it should process dictionaries

### Conclusion
The lack of documentation doesn't excuse the implementation error. The function's name, type hints, and usage context make its intended behavior clear: it should filter None values from a dictionary. The current implementation fails to fulfill this obvious purpose.
