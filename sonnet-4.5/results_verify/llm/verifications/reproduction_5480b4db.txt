# Reproduction of the Bug

## Summary
I've successfully reproduced aspects of the bug report, finding that there IS a legitimate bug in the `not_nulls` function when it receives a dict input, but the bug report is partially incorrect about when this happens with Pydantic models.

## Test Results

### 1. Pydantic Model Input (as claimed in bug report)
When `not_nulls` receives a Pydantic model (like `SharedOptions`):
- **WORKS CORRECTLY** - The function succeeds
- Iterating over a Pydantic model yields `(key, value)` tuples, not just field names as the bug report claims
- The unpacking `for key, value in data` works as expected

### 2. Dict Input (also mentioned in bug report)
When `not_nulls` receives a dict:
- **FAILS WITH ValueError** - "too many values to unpack (expected 2)"
- Iterating over a dict yields only keys (strings), not (key, value) pairs
- The unpacking `for key, value in data` fails because it tries to unpack a single string

## The Real Bug

The function on line 916 of openai_models.py:
```python
def not_nulls(data) -> dict:
    return {key: value for key, value in data if value is not None}
```

This function is broken for dict inputs because iterating a dict yields keys only, not key-value pairs. It should use `data.items()` for dicts.

## Where the Bug Could Manifest

1. **Line 658**: `kwargs = dict(not_nulls(prompt.options))`
   - `prompt.options` could theoretically be a dict based on line 365 in models.py: `self.options = options or {}`
   - However, in practice, most code paths convert options to a Pydantic model before creating Prompt objects

2. **Actual Risk**: The bug exists but appears to be masked in most normal usage because:
   - Most Prompt creation paths use `model.Options(**options)` which creates a Pydantic model
   - Direct Prompt instantiation with dict options seems rare in the codebase

## Confirmed Behaviors

1. `not_nulls(SharedOptions(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=None))` → Works, returns `{'temperature': 0.7}`
2. `not_nulls({'temperature': 0.7, 'max_tokens': None})` → Fails with ValueError
3. The function is only called once in the codebase (line 658)
4. The input to `not_nulls` is `prompt.options`, which could be either a Pydantic model or a dict depending on how the Prompt was created

## Conclusion

The bug is REAL but the report's explanation is partially incorrect:
- The function DOES work with Pydantic models (contrary to the report's claim)
- The function DOES NOT work with dicts (which the report correctly identifies)
- The bug could manifest if a Prompt is created with dict options directly, though this appears rare in practice
