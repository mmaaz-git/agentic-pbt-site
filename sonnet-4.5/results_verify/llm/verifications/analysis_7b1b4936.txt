## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering: INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible - the specific error message IS being masked
- The code does lose information that could be useful for debugging
- The report accurately describes what the code does

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- No documentation explicitly requires specific error messages be preserved
- The function still correctly validates inputs and raises errors for invalid inputs
- Error message specificity is not part of the documented contract

### Considering: WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- This is about error message clarity, not functional correctness
- The function still works correctly - it validates and rejects invalid inputs
- Users can still figure out the problem through trial and error
- The generic error message is technically correct - it IS an invalid key-value pair

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- Error message clarity is important for developer experience
- The fix is trivial (as shown in the bug report)
- Better error messages reduce support burden

### Considering: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't specify what error messages should be shown
- The code technically works as intended - it validates inputs

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation isn't wrong - it just doesn't specify error message requirements
- This is about code quality, not documentation accuracy

### Considering: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Better error messages could be seen as an enhancement rather than a bug
- The current code works correctly from a functional perspective
- This is requesting "better" error messages, which is a quality improvement

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The code already attempts to provide specific error messages (line 427)
- This is fixing unintended behavior where specific errors get masked
- The bug report shows this is a regression in error handling quality

### Considering: BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The code explicitly creates a specific error message on line 427
- That specific error is unintentionally caught and replaced with a generic one
- This makes debugging harder for users
- The proposed fix is simple and improves user experience
- The error handling conflates two distinct error cases unnecessarily

**Arguments against BUG:**
- No documentation violation
- The function still works correctly from a validation perspective
- This is about error message quality, not correctness

### Analysis Summary
The core issue is that the code creates a specific, helpful error message ("Value must be between -100 and 100") but then immediately catches and replaces it with a generic message. This appears to be unintentional error handling that reduces debugging clarity.

While there's no explicit documentation requirement for specific error messages, the fact that the code ATTEMPTS to provide a specific message (line 427) suggests the intent was to give users helpful feedback. The current catch-all exception handling defeats this purpose.

This is best categorized as either FEATURE_REQUEST (if we consider better error messages an enhancement) or WONTFIX (if we consider error message clarity a minor issue). Given that:
1. The function works correctly from a validation perspective
2. No documentation specifies error message requirements
3. The issue only affects error message clarity, not functionality
4. Users can still debug through trial and error

I lean toward **FEATURE_REQUEST** - this is requesting an improvement to error messaging to make the library more user-friendly, rather than fixing broken functionality.
