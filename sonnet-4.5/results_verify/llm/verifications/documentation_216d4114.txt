Documentation Analysis for redact_data Function
==============================================

Documentation Found:
The only documentation for the redact_data function is its docstring:
```
Recursively search through the input dictionary for any 'image_url' keys
and modify the 'url' value to be just 'data:...'.

Also redact input_audio.data keys
```

Key Observations:

1. The docstring uses the word "modify" which is ambiguous - it could mean:
   - Modify in-place (current implementation)
   - Create a modified copy (expected by the bug report)

2. No external documentation found:
   - No mention in the project's README
   - No mention in the official documentation at llm.datasette.io
   - No unit tests that clarify expected behavior

3. Current usage pattern:
   - The function is called 3 times in the codebase, always with freshly created dictionaries
   - Example: redact_data({"messages": messages})
   - This means current usage doesn't suffer from the mutation bug

4. Python conventions and best practices:
   - In Python, data transformation functions typically return new objects unless explicitly documented otherwise
   - Functions that mutate in-place usually have names like "update", "mutate", or end with "_inplace"
   - The name "redact_data" suggests a transformation that returns redacted data, not mutation

5. No explicit statement about:
   - Whether the function should preserve the original data
   - Whether the function should return a new object or the same object
   - What the expected behavior is when the input is reused

Conclusion:
The documentation is incomplete and ambiguous. It doesn't explicitly state whether the function should mutate in-place or create a copy. However, Python conventions and the function name suggest it should not mutate the input.
