## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The function crashes with an unhelpful ZeroDivisionError instead of handling the edge case gracefully
2. Cosine similarity with zero vectors is a well-known edge case in vector mathematics
3. Major libraries like scikit-learn handle this case gracefully (returning 0)
4. The error message doesn't help users understand what went wrong
5. This is a utility function that users rely on for embeddings/similarity calculations
6. The fix is straightforward and improves user experience

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is mathematically undefined for zero vectors, so crashing isn't technically "wrong"
- The function has no documentation claiming it handles zero vectors

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The function has NO documentation whatsoever
2. Without documentation, there's no specification being violated
3. Mathematically, cosine similarity IS undefined for zero vectors
4. The bug report wants ValueError instead of ZeroDivisionError, which is just a preference

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Even without documentation, crashing with ZeroDivisionError is poor user experience
- The mathematical undefinedness should be communicated clearly to users

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. Zero vectors are edge cases that might not occur in normal embedding use
2. The error type (ZeroDivisionError vs ValueError) is a minor distinction

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - zero vectors can occur in real-world scenarios
- The fix is simple and improves the library

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The function lacks ANY documentation
2. Adding documentation about the zero vector limitation would inform users
3. Users could then handle the exception themselves

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug report is about the code behavior, not documentation
- Even with documentation, the poor error message remains problematic

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. The function currently doesn't handle zero vectors
2. The bug report is asking for NEW functionality (graceful error handling)
3. This would be adding a new capability to detect and handle an edge case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Error handling for known edge cases is typically considered a bug fix, not a feature
- Most users would expect proper error messages for invalid inputs

### Final Assessment

This is most appropriately classified as a **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Poor User Experience**: The current ZeroDivisionError provides no context about what went wrong. Users have to debug to understand the issue.

2. **Known Edge Case**: Zero vectors in cosine similarity calculations are a well-known mathematical edge case that quality libraries handle.

3. **Industry Standards**: Major libraries like scikit-learn handle this case gracefully. While they return 0 (which may not be ideal), they don't crash.

4. **Simple Fix**: The proposed fix is minimal and improves the library significantly.

5. **Real-World Impact**: Users working with embeddings can encounter zero vectors (e.g., empty documents, failed embeddings, initialization values).

While the lack of documentation means there's no explicit contract being violated, the principle of least surprise suggests that a utility function should provide helpful error messages for known edge cases rather than crashing with low-level arithmetic errors.
