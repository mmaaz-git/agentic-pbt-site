BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed:

1. The encode/decode functions DO lose precision for very small float values.

2. Test results confirm the bug:
   - Input value: 4.484782386619779e-144
   - Decoded value: 0.0
   - The values do not match - round-trip property is violated

3. The Hypothesis test fails as reported, confirming the systematic issue.

4. Root cause analysis:
   - The encode() function uses 'f' format (32-bit float)
   - Float32 can only represent values down to ~1.4e-45 (denormalized minimum)
   - Values below this threshold underflow to 0
   - The test value 4.484782386619779e-144 is far below this threshold

5. Additional findings:
   - Values like 1e-100, 1e-200, and the reported 4.484782e-144 all decode to 0.0
   - Even values near the float32 limits (1e-38, 1e-45) have precision issues
   - The encoded bytes for the tiny value are 00000000 (representing 0.0 in float32)

The bug is real and affects any values outside the float32 representable range (approximately ±3.4e38 to ±1.4e-45). This is a fundamental limitation of using single-precision floats for encoding/decoding.
