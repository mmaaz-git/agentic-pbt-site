BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
-------------------------
STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
✓ The function crashes on ALL dictionary inputs with ValueError
✓ The crash is deterministic and reproducible
✓ The function has a clear intended purpose (filter None values from dict)
✓ The fix is trivial and obvious (missing .items())
✓ Similar function in same codebase (remove_dict_none_values) uses correct pattern
✓ Function is used in production code path (OpenAI model invocations)
✓ Type hint clearly indicates dict input/output expected
✓ The error prevents entire OpenAI plugin from functioning

NO EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- This is clearly a programming error, not a design choice

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
-----------------------------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
✗ The bug is real and reproducible
✗ The function signature indicates dict -> dict
✗ The usage context shows dictionary input expected
✗ No alternative interpretation makes sense

NO EVIDENCE FOR:
- There's no scenario where this implementation is correct

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
----------------------------------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
✗ This is not an obscure edge case - it fails on ALL inputs
✗ The function is in the critical path for OpenAI API calls
✗ Not a minor issue - causes complete crash
✗ Affects major functionality (all OpenAI model usage)

NO EVIDENCE FOR:
- This is a critical bug, not trivial

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
--------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
✗ The function already exists with clear intent
✗ Not asking for new functionality
✗ The type hints show this should work
✗ The fix restores intended behavior, doesn't add features

NO EVIDENCE FOR:
- This is fixing broken code, not adding features

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Docs Wrong)
---------------------------------
EVIDENCE AGAINST:
✗ No documentation exists to be wrong
✗ The function name and signature are self-documenting
✗ The code is wrong, not any documentation
✗ Even without docs, the implementation is clearly incorrect

NO EVIDENCE FOR:
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------
- Function name "not_nulls" clearly indicates filtering None values
- Parameter name "data" with dict return type hint shows dictionary expected
- Dictionary comprehension syntax requires .items() for key-value iteration
- Python fundamentals: iterating over dict yields keys, not key-value pairs
- The error message "not enough values to unpack" is diagnostic of this exact mistake

CONCLUSION
----------
This is unambiguously a BUG. The function has a clear syntax error that prevents it from working with any input. The missing .items() is a common Python mistake that causes the function to fail its obvious intended purpose. This should be filed as a valid bug report requiring immediate fix.
