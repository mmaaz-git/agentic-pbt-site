## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for `llm.utils.truncate_string`.

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is **CONFIRMED** and reproducible. The function violates its documented contract when `max_length < 3`.

### Technical Details

#### The Problem
The issue occurs in line 476 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/utils.py`:
```python
return text[: max_length - 3] + "..."
```

When `max_length < 3`, the expression `max_length - 3` becomes negative. In Python, negative slice indices have special meaning:
- `text[:-1]` means "all characters except the last one"
- `text[:-2]` means "all characters except the last two"
- `text[:-3]` means "all characters except the last three"

This causes the function to return nearly the entire input string plus "...", resulting in strings much longer than `max_length`.

#### Reproduced Examples
1. `truncate_string("hello world", max_length=2)` returns `"hello worl..."` (length 13, exceeds max_length of 2)
2. `truncate_string("hello world", max_length=1)` returns `"hello wor..."` (length 12, exceeds max_length of 1)
3. `truncate_string("hello world", max_length=0)` returns `"hello wo..."` (length 11, exceeds max_length of 0)
4. `truncate_string("x", max_length=0)` returns `"..."` (length 3, exceeds max_length of 0)

#### When It Works Correctly
- For `max_length >= 3` and text that needs truncation, the function works as expected
- For text shorter than `max_length`, the function correctly returns the original text
- The `keep_end=True` option works correctly for `max_length >= 9`

### Impact Assessment
The bug affects edge cases where `max_length < 3`. While these are unusual values, they are:
1. Valid according to the function signature (accepts any integer)
2. Not explicitly documented as invalid inputs
3. Could occur in programmatic usage where `max_length` is calculated dynamically

The function's behavior directly contradicts its documented contract that the result will be truncated "to a maximum length".
