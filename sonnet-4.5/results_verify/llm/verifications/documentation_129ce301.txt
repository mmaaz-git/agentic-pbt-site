## Documentation Analysis for cosine_similarity

### Function Documentation
The `llm.cosine_similarity` function has **NO documentation**. There is:
- No docstring in the function definition
- No parameter descriptions
- No return value description
- No mention of expected behavior with edge cases
- No error handling documentation

### Mathematical Background (from external sources)
According to mathematical definitions and standard practices:
1. Cosine similarity is mathematically **undefined** for zero vectors
2. The formula cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||) results in division by zero when ||A|| = 0 or ||B|| = 0
3. This is a well-known limitation in mathematics, not a programming oversight

### Standard Practices in Similar Libraries
Based on web search results and common implementations:
1. Many libraries handle zero vectors by either:
   - Raising a descriptive error (e.g., ValueError with message about zero vectors)
   - Returning a special value (0.0, NaN, or None)
   - Documenting the undefined behavior explicitly

2. The undefined nature for zero vectors is considered fundamental - it's not a bug in the mathematical sense, but how it's handled programmatically varies

### Key Finding
Since the function has **no documentation whatsoever**, there is no specified behavior for how it should handle zero vectors. The current implementation follows the direct mathematical formula without any error handling or special cases.

### Conclusion
The lack of documentation means:
1. Users have no way to know the function will raise ZeroDivisionError for zero vectors
2. The expected behavior for edge cases is completely unspecified
3. Whether this is a bug or expected behavior cannot be determined from documentation alone

However, the lack of graceful error handling (allowing raw ZeroDivisionError to propagate) suggests this is likely an oversight rather than intentional design, especially for a user-facing API function.
