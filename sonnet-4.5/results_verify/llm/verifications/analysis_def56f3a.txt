TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect)
   Arguments AGAINST marking as INVALID:
   - The bug is real and reproducible
   - The function does fail with regular Python dicts
   - The type signature suggests it should accept dicts
   - The function name "not_nulls" suggests general utility

   Arguments FOR marking as INVALID:
   - The function works correctly in its actual usage context
   - It's never called with a dict in the codebase
   - Could be considered an internal implementation detail

   Verdict: NOT INVALID - The bug is real and the type signature is misleading

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   Arguments FOR marking as WONTFIX:
   - The function is only used internally in one place
   - It works correctly with its actual input (Pydantic models)
   - The bug doesn't affect any real users currently
   - It's a small utility function that may never be exposed publicly

   Arguments AGAINST marking as WONTFIX:
   - The misleading type signature could cause future bugs
   - If someone tries to reuse this function, they'll hit the bug
   - The fix is trivial (add .items() to the iteration)
   - Type signatures should be accurate for maintainability

   Verdict: POSSIBLE WONTFIX - Internal function with no current impact

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
   Arguments FOR marking as FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Supporting regular dicts could be seen as a new feature
   - The function was designed for Pydantic models specifically

   Arguments AGAINST marking as FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The type signature already claims to return a dict
   - Filtering None values from dicts is basic functionality
   - The function name suggests it should be generic

   Verdict: NOT A FEATURE_REQUEST - Basic dict support is expected

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   Arguments FOR marking as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - There's no documentation specifying input requirements
   - Adding documentation about Pydantic-only support would clarify
   - The type signature could be updated to be more specific

   Arguments AGAINST marking as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code itself is buggy, not just the documentation
   - Type signatures are part of the code contract
   - Fixing only documentation leaves the fragile code intact

   Verdict: PARTIAL DOCUMENTATION_FIX - But code fix is better

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments FOR marking as BUG:
   - The function fails with standard Python dicts
   - The type signature is misleading
   - The implementation violates Python conventions
   - The fix is simple and improves robustness
   - Following the principle of least surprise
   - Makes the code more maintainable and reusable

   Arguments AGAINST marking as BUG:
   - No current production impact
   - Works correctly in its only usage
   - Could be considered working as designed for internal use

   Verdict: STRONG CANDIDATE FOR BUG

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
-----------------
This is a judgment call between BUG and WONTFIX. Key factors:

1. The function has a generic name and signature suggesting broad utility
2. The implementation is fragile and non-idiomatic Python
3. The fix is trivial and makes the code more robust
4. Type signatures should accurately reflect behavior
5. Even internal functions benefit from correct implementation

While the bug has no current production impact, the misleading type signature and
non-idiomatic implementation make this a legitimate BUG worth fixing. The principle
of least surprise and code maintainability support fixing it rather than leaving
it as technical debt.

RECOMMENDATION: BUG
