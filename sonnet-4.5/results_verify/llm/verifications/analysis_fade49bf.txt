## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report claims an IndexError occurs when processing empty fields in the schema DSL, but this is factually incorrect. The code already handles empty fields properly by filtering them out on line 382 with `if field.strip()`. The exact test case provided (`"field1 str, , field2 int"`) works correctly and returns the expected schema without any errors. The claimed error is mathematically impossible given the current implementation - if a field passes the filter (non-empty after strip), it will always have at least one element when split, preventing the IndexError.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
There could theoretically be a different version of the code or environment where this bug exists. However, testing the exact path and code provided shows the bug doesn't exist. The bug reporter might have been testing against a different version or modified code.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Even if there was some obscure edge case where empty fields could cause issues, the current behavior of silently ignoring empty fields is reasonable and matches common DSL parsing behavior. Many parsers tolerate extra delimiters and whitespace for user convenience. The function already handles this gracefully.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This isn't a valid bug to begin with, so WONTFIX doesn't apply. WONTFIX is for real issues that won't be addressed, but this issue doesn't exist.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state how the function handles malformed input like consecutive commas or empty fields. Adding documentation about this behavior (that empty fields are silently ignored) could prevent confusion. The current docstring only mentions "comma-separated or newline-separated" without specifying edge case handling.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior is intuitive and follows common parsing conventions. Most users would expect extra commas to be ignored rather than cause errors. The documentation doesn't need to enumerate every edge case, especially when the behavior is reasonable.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug reporter seems to want stricter validation that would raise a ValueError for malformed input instead of silently ignoring empty fields. This could be seen as requesting a new feature for strict parsing mode or better error messages for malformed schemas.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The reporter explicitly filed this as a bug claiming the code crashes, not as a request for stricter validation. They're not asking for new functionality but claiming existing functionality is broken (which it isn't).

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The reporter provides specific reproduction steps and claims a crash occurs. If this were true, it would certainly be a bug since DSL parsers shouldn't crash on malformed input.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The reproduction steps don't actually reproduce any bug. The code works correctly as designed, handling empty fields gracefully by filtering them out. The claimed IndexError is impossible with the current implementation due to the protective filtering on line 382. All test cases pass successfully.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report is clearly INVALID. The reporter claims that the function crashes with an IndexError when given input with empty fields (consecutive commas), but testing proves this claim is false. The code already contains proper safeguards that filter out empty fields before processing them, making the claimed error impossible.

The key evidence is on line 382 of the source code: `fields = [field.strip() for field in schema_dsl.split(",") if field.strip()]`. This list comprehension explicitly filters out any field that becomes empty after stripping whitespace. This filtering happens before any attempt to access `field_parts[0]`, completely preventing the claimed IndexError.

Testing the exact reproduction case provided by the reporter shows it works correctly, returning a valid schema without errors. Furthermore, extensive edge case testing with various combinations of commas, whitespace, and newlines all work correctly. The property-based test also passes without any failures. The mathematical impossibility of the bug (a non-empty string after strip() always produces at least one element when split()) confirms this is a false report.
