Reproduction Results for llm.utils._parse_kwargs Bug Report
===========================================================

## Test Environment
- Python version: 3.13
- LLM package location: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/

## Reproduction of Reported Bug

### Main Test Case
Input: `'key1=[1,2], key2=], key3=3'`
Expected (per bug report): Error mentioning unbalanced brackets
Actual output: `Error: Value for 'key2' is not valid JSON: ], key3=3`

**CONFIRMED**: The error message is confusing. It suggests `'], key3=3'` is the value for `key2`, when the real issue is an unbalanced closing bracket.

### Depth Tracking Analysis
Traced through the parsing character by character:
- At position 5: `[` encountered, depth becomes 1
- At position 9: `]` encountered, depth becomes 0
- At position 10: `,` encountered at depth 0, first token extracted: `'key1=[1,2]'`
- At position 17: `]` encountered, depth becomes -1 (NEGATIVE!)
- At position 19: `,` encountered but depth is -1, so NO token split occurs
- Final token extracted: `'key2=], key3=3'`

**CONFIRMED**: The depth counter goes negative, preventing proper token splitting.

## Additional Test Cases

1. **Extra closing bracket**: `'key1=1, key2=]'`
   - Result: `Error: Value for 'key2' is not valid JSON: ]`
   - Confusing error, doesn't mention the real problem

2. **Missing closing bracket**: `'key1=[1,2'`
   - Result: `Error: Value for 'key1' is not valid JSON: [1,2`
   - This error makes more sense (incomplete JSON)

3. **Well-balanced brackets**: `'key1=[1,2], key2={"a": 1}'`
   - Result: `{'key1': [1, 2], 'key2': {'a': 1}}`
   - Works correctly

4. **Multiple nested unbalanced**: `'key1=[[[1,2], key2=3'`
   - Result: `Error: Value for 'key1' is not valid JSON: [[[1,2], key2=3`
   - Error message is technically correct but doesn't help identify the issue

## Hypothesis Test
The provided hypothesis test passes, confirming that the function doesn't raise errors mentioning "unbalanced" or "bracket" for balanced inputs.

## Summary
The bug report is **technically accurate**:
1. The depth counter does go negative with unbalanced closing brackets
2. This causes incorrect token grouping (confirmed with `key2=], key3=3` being treated as one token)
3. The error messages are confusing and don't indicate the root cause (unbalanced brackets)
4. The function doesn't validate bracket balance before processing
