DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
The not_nulls function has:
- NO docstring
- NO inline comments
- NO documentation in the official LLM documentation (https://llm.datasette.io/)
- Only a type hint for return value: `-> dict`
- No type hint for the input parameter

2. INFERRED PURPOSE FROM CODE CONTEXT
Based on the code review:
- The function is a utility to filter out None values from a data structure
- It's used internally in build_kwargs() to clean options before passing to OpenAI API
- The usage pattern is: dict(not_nulls(prompt.options))
- prompt.options is a Pydantic BaseModel instance

3. DOCUMENTATION GAPS
- No specification of what types of input are accepted
- No documentation that it requires objects that yield (key, value) tuples when iterated
- The function name and return type suggest it should work with dicts, but it doesn't
- No indication that this is an internal-only function

4. PYDANTIC ITERATION BEHAVIOR
Pydantic v2 BaseModel instances have special iteration behavior:
- When iterated, they yield (field_name, field_value) tuples
- This is NOT standard Python dict behavior
- Regular dicts yield only keys when iterated without .items()

5. TYPE SIGNATURE ANALYSIS
Current signature: `def not_nulls(data) -> dict:`
- Parameter `data` has no type hint (implicitly Any)
- Return type is dict
- This signature suggests the function is generic and should work with any data type
- The implementation contradicts this expectation

6. COMPARISON WITH PYTHON CONVENTIONS
Standard Python idioms for filtering None values from dicts:
- `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v is not None}` - for dicts
- `dict(filter(lambda x: x[1] is not None, d.items()))` - alternative
The current implementation uses neither standard pattern.

7. NO EXPLICIT CONTRACT
There is no documented contract that specifies:
- This function is only for Pydantic models
- This function is internal-only
- The expected iteration behavior of the input

CONCLUSION: The lack of documentation means we must judge based on:
1. The function name (suggests general utility)
2. The type signature (suggests dict compatibility)
3. Common Python conventions (dicts are fundamental types)
4. Principle of least surprise (functions accepting "data" should handle dicts)
