## Documentation Analysis for llm.utils.schema_dsl

### Function Docstring
The function has a docstring that states:
```
Build a JSON schema from a concise schema string.

Args:
    schema_dsl: A string representing a schema in the concise format.
        Can be comma-separated or newline-separated.
    multi: Boolean, return a schema for an "items" array of these

Returns:
    A dictionary representing the JSON schema.
```

### Official Documentation (from llm.datasette.io)
The official documentation describes the schema DSL syntax as follows:

**Supported Format:**
- Basic field names: `name, bio`
- With type annotations: `name, age int, bio`
- With descriptions using colon: `name: the person's name, age int: their age`
- Fields can be comma-separated or newline-separated

**Supported Types:**
- `str` (default type if not specified)
- `int` (maps to "integer" in JSON schema)
- `float` (maps to "number" in JSON schema)
- `bool` (maps to "boolean" in JSON schema)

**Valid Field Format:**
The documentation examples consistently show the format as:
```
field_name [type] [: description]
```

Where:
- `field_name` is required
- `type` is optional (defaults to string)
- `: description` is optional

### Key Observations
1. **Field Name Requirement**: Every example in the documentation shows a field name before any optional type or description. No examples show a field starting directly with a colon.

2. **Description Syntax**: Descriptions are always shown as additions to a field specification, not as standalone elements. The format is always `field_name: description` or `field_name type: description`.

3. **No Mention of Empty Field Names**: The documentation does not specify what should happen when a field specification contains only a description (starting with `:`) without a field name.

4. **Code Implementation**: The code at line 396 assumes that after splitting on `:` and processing, there will always be at least one element in `field_parts` when accessing `field_parts[0]`.

### Conclusion
The documentation strongly implies that every field must have a name. All examples show field names as mandatory components. The documentation does not specify behavior for fields that start with `:` (description-only fields), nor does it suggest this is a supported format.
