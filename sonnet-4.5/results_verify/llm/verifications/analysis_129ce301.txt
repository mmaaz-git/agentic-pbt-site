## Triage Analysis for cosine_similarity Bug Report

### Consideration for Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function crashes with an unhelpful ZeroDivisionError instead of providing meaningful feedback
- Zero vectors are a realistic input that users might encounter (sparse embeddings, initialization values)
- The function accepts lists of numbers as valid input but crashes on certain valid lists
- Most production libraries handle this case more gracefully
- The error message doesn't help users understand what went wrong

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Cosine similarity is mathematically undefined for zero vectors
- The implementation correctly follows the mathematical formula

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Cosine similarity is mathematically undefined for zero vectors, so an error is expected
- The function implements the mathematical formula correctly
- No documentation promises it will handle zero vectors

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- ZeroDivisionError is not the most descriptive error for this case
- The function should validate inputs if certain inputs are invalid
- "Valid inputs (lists of numbers) should not cause unhandled exceptions" is a reasonable expectation

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Zero vectors are an extreme edge case that might not occur frequently
- The mathematical operation is inherently undefined

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - zero vectors commonly appear in:
  - Sparse data representations
  - Initial values in machine learning
  - Text embeddings for empty strings
  - User-generated content
- The fix is trivial to implement

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Adding handling for undefined mathematical operations could be seen as a new feature
- The function currently implements pure mathematics without special cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Error handling is not a feature, it's a basic requirement
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The function already exists and should work robustly

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function has no documentation at all
- Adding documentation about the zero vector limitation would help users

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The issue is about the code crashing, not just missing documentation
- Even with documentation, letting ZeroDivisionError propagate is poor design
- Documentation alone doesn't solve the practical problem

### Analysis Summary

The core issue is that a public API function crashes with an unhelpful error message on reasonable inputs. While cosine similarity is mathematically undefined for zero vectors, a production library should:

1. Either validate inputs and raise a descriptive error
2. Or return a sentinel value with documentation

The current implementation does neither, allowing a low-level arithmetic error to propagate. This violates the principle of defensive programming and providing useful error messages to users.

The fact that the function has no documentation makes it impossible for users to anticipate this behavior, but even with documentation, the current behavior would be considered poor API design.
