Bug Triage Analysis for truncate_string max_length Issue
=========================================================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function might never have been intended to work with max_length values less than 3. Many truncation functions have implicit minimum lengths because adding an ellipsis to indicate truncation requires at least some characters. The user might be misunderstanding the intended use case.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation clearly states "Maximum length of the result string" without any caveats or minimum value requirements. The parameter name "max_length" has a clear semantic meaning that the result should not exceed this length. The bug is reproducible and the function demonstrably violates its documented contract.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an extreme edge case - who would ever want to truncate a string to 1 or 2 characters? The practical impact is minimal as no reasonable use case would set max_length so low. The function works correctly for all reasonable max_length values (3 and above). Fixing this might add unnecessary complexity for a scenario that would never occur in practice.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug causes the function to return results that are drastically wrong - instead of a 1-character string, it returns a 12+ character string. This is not a minor deviation but a complete failure of the function's core purpose. The fix is simple and doesn't add significant complexity.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function could be working as designed, with an implicit understanding that max_length must be at least 3 to accommodate the ellipsis. The documentation could be updated to specify "max_length must be >= 3" or "for max_length < 3, behavior is undefined." This would align the documentation with the current implementation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior for max_length < 3 is clearly broken - it returns strings much longer than max_length, which makes no sense for any reasonable interpretation. This isn't a case where the code has reasonable behavior that just needs documenting; the code is objectively wrong.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting max_length < 3 could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The original implementation might never have considered this use case, and adding support for it would be extending the function's capabilities beyond its original design scope.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already accepts max_length=1 or 2 as valid input without raising an error. It attempts to process these values but does so incorrectly. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function has a clear contract stated in its documentation: truncate to a maximum length. It violates this contract for certain inputs. The parameter is named "max_length" which has unambiguous semantics. The function returns results that are objectively wrong - strings that are longer than the specified maximum. The fix is straightforward and the bug report provides a reasonable solution.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Very few real-world use cases would ever use max_length < 3. The function works correctly for all reasonable values. This could be considered an implementation detail rather than a bug if the function was never meant to handle such small values.

**Overall consideration**
This issue presents a clear violation of the function's documented contract. The docstring explicitly states that max_length is the "Maximum length of the result string" with no qualifications or exceptions. When a function accepts a parameter and produces output that directly contradicts that parameter's documented purpose, this is a bug. The fact that the bug occurs only for edge case values (max_length < 3) doesn't change this fundamental contract violation.

However, the practical impact of this bug is essentially zero. No reasonable use case would truncate a string to 1 or 2 characters with an ellipsis. The function works correctly for all values >= 3, which covers all practical scenarios. While technically a bug, many maintainers would consider this too trivial to fix, especially since fixing it requires adding special-case code for an unrealistic scenario.

Given the instructions that bugs should only be reported when they are "100% objective bugs with no debate," and that most bug reports from this user are incorrect, I lean toward WONTFIX. The edge case is so extreme and impractical that most maintainers would close this as not worth fixing. The current behavior, while technically wrong, would never impact real users.
