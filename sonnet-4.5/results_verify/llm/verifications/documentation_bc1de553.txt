DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION STATUS
-----------------------------
The `not_nulls` function has NO documentation:
- No docstring in the function itself
- No external documentation found in the LLM documentation site (llm.datasette.io)
- No documentation found in the GitHub repository README
- No unit tests found for this function specifically
- Function is not exposed in the public API documentation

FUNCTION PURPOSE (Inferred from Context)
----------------------------------------
Based on code analysis:
1. The function is used internally in the `build_kwargs` method at line 658
2. It's called as: `kwargs = dict(not_nulls(prompt.options))`
3. `prompt.options` is a dictionary (confirmed at llm/models.py:365 where it's initialized as `{}`)
4. The function signature shows it returns a dict: `def not_nulls(data) -> dict:`

The intended purpose is clearly to:
- Take a dictionary as input
- Filter out key-value pairs where the value is None
- Return a new dictionary with only non-None values

SIMILAR FUNCTION IN CODEBASE
----------------------------
There is a similar function `remove_dict_none_values` in llm/utils.py (lines 78-95) that:
- Correctly uses `d.items()` for dictionary iteration
- Recursively removes None values from nested structures
- Is imported and used throughout the openai_models.py file

This proves the pattern and intended behavior - dictionaries should be iterated with `.items()`

DOCUMENTATION IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------
Since the function is:
1. Internal/private (not part of public API)
2. Has a clear type hint indicating dict return type
3. Has an obvious name suggesting its purpose (not_nulls = remove nulls)
4. Is used with dictionary inputs (prompt.options)

The lack of explicit documentation doesn't excuse the bug. The function signature and usage context make it unambiguous that:
- Input should be a dictionary
- Output should be a dictionary
- The function should filter None values

The bug is a clear implementation error, not a documentation issue. The function fails to perform its obvious intended purpose due to missing `.items()` in the dictionary comprehension.
