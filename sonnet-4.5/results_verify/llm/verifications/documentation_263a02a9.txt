DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=======================

Source Code:
The llm.decode() function is defined in /llm/__init__.py at line 454-455:
```python
def decode(binary):
    return struct.unpack("<" + "f" * (len(binary) // 4), binary)
```

Official Documentation Found:
From https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/storage.html:
- The encode() and decode() functions are documented as utility functions for converting between binary format and floating point arrays
- They handle little-endian 32-bit floating point numbers
- Each float is represented using exactly 4 bytes
- The documentation shows the exact implementation but does NOT specify:
  * What happens with invalid input lengths
  * Whether validation is performed
  * Expected error behavior
  * Preconditions about input requirements

Documentation Gaps:
1. No docstring exists for the decode() function
2. No explicit statement about the requirement that binary length must be divisible by 4
3. No documentation of error cases or exceptions
4. No examples showing proper error handling

Implicit Behavior:
The function relies entirely on Python's struct.unpack() for validation and error handling. The struct module documentation indicates that struct.unpack() requires exact buffer size matches and will raise struct.error if the buffer size doesn't match the format string.

Assessment:
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that input must be a multiple of 4 bytes, this is an inherent requirement of the 32-bit float format. The function correctly delegates validation to struct.unpack(), which enforces this constraint by raising an appropriate exception.

The behavior is reasonable and expected for a low-level binary conversion function, even if not explicitly documented.
