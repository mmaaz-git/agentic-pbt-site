## Documentation Analysis for truncate_string

I examined the documentation for the `truncate_string` function in `llm.utils`. Here's what I found:

### Function Signature
```python
def truncate_string(
    text: str,
    max_length: int = 100,
    normalize_whitespace: bool = False,
    keep_end: bool = False,
) -> str:
```

### Docstring
The function's docstring states:
"Truncate a string to a maximum length, with options to normalize whitespace and keep both start and end.

Args:
    text: The string to truncate
    max_length: Maximum length of the result string
    normalize_whitespace: If True, replace all whitespace with a single space
    keep_end: If True, keep both beginning and end of string

Returns:
    Truncated string"

### Key Findings

1. **The documentation explicitly states that `max_length` is the "Maximum length of the result string"**. This is a clear promise that the returned string should not exceed `max_length` characters.

2. There is no mention in the documentation of any special cases or exceptions where the returned string could be longer than `max_length`.

3. The documentation does not specify what should happen for edge cases like `max_length < 3` or negative values.

4. There is no external documentation found in GitHub repos or official documentation sites that provides additional clarification on the expected behavior.

5. The function name itself, "truncate_string", strongly implies that the function should truncate (shorten) the string, not make it longer.

### Conclusion from Documentation
Based on the documentation alone, the function should honor the `max_length` parameter as an upper bound for the returned string length. The documentation makes a clear promise: "Maximum length of the result string". There are no documented exceptions to this rule.
