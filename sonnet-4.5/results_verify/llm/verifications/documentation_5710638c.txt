DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Pydantic BaseModel Iteration Documentation:
------------------------------------------------
Source: https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.10/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.__iter__

The official Pydantic documentation for BaseModel.__iter__ shows that when iterating over a BaseModel instance, it yields key-value pairs (tuples):

From the source code:
- Yields tuples from: `(k, v) for (k, v) in self.__dict__.items() if not k.startswith('_')`
- Additionally yields items from __pydantic_extra__ if present

This confirms that BaseModel.__iter__ yields (key, value) tuples, NOT strings.

2. LLM Module Code Structure:
------------------------------
- The Options class is defined in llm/models.py line 1706 as: class Options(BaseModel)
- It uses Pydantic's BaseModel as its parent class
- The not_nulls function at line 915 expects an iterable that yields (key, value) pairs
- The function is called at line 658: kwargs = dict(not_nulls(prompt.options))

3. Expected Behavior:
---------------------
Based on the documentation and code:
- prompt.options is an instance of Options, which inherits from BaseModel
- When iterated, BaseModel instances yield (key, value) tuples
- The not_nulls function correctly unpacks these tuples with: for key, value in data
- This is the documented and intended behavior

4. Bug Report's Claim vs Reality:
----------------------------------
Bug Report Claims: "In Pydantic v2, iterating over a BaseModel instance yields field names (strings)"
Actual Documentation: BaseModel.__iter__ yields (key, value) tuples

The bug report's fundamental premise is incorrect. The behavior described in the bug report does not match the official Pydantic documentation or actual implementation.

CONCLUSION:
-----------
The not_nulls function is working as designed and is compatible with Pydantic v2's documented iteration behavior. The bug report is based on an incorrect understanding of how Pydantic BaseModel iteration works.
