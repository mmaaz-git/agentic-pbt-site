DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR truncate_string FUNCTION

SOURCE: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/utils.py

FUNCTION SIGNATURE:
def truncate_string(
    text: str,
    max_length: int = 100,
    normalize_whitespace: bool = False,
    keep_end: bool = False,
) -> str:

DOCSTRING CONTENT:
"""
Truncate a string to a maximum length, with options to normalize whitespace and keep both start and end.

Args:
    text: The string to truncate
    max_length: Maximum length of the result string
    normalize_whitespace: If True, replace all whitespace with a single space
    keep_end: If True, keep both beginning and end of string

Returns:
    Truncated string
"""

KEY DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:

1. The docstring explicitly states "Truncate a string to a maximum length"
2. The parameter `max_length` is documented as "Maximum length of the result string"
3. The word "maximum" clearly implies an upper bound - the result should not exceed this length
4. There are no documented exceptions or special cases mentioned for small values of max_length
5. There is no mention that the ellipsis ("...") might cause the result to exceed max_length
6. The documentation does not specify what happens when max_length is too small to accommodate ellipsis

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FROM CODE:
- Line 476 shows: return text[: max_length - 3] + "..."
- This always appends "..." which is 3 characters
- When max_length < 3, the slicing becomes text[:negative_number] which returns an empty string, then "..." is appended, resulting in a 3-character output
- The code comment on line 475 says "Fall back to simple truncation for very small max_length" but the implementation doesn't actually handle the "very small" case properly

EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION:
- No additional external documentation was found for this specific function
- The llm package appears to be a command-line tool for working with Large Language Models
- No README or separate documentation files found within the package directory

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is clear and unambiguous: max_length represents the "Maximum length of the result string". There are no caveats, exceptions, or special cases documented that would allow the result to exceed this maximum length.
