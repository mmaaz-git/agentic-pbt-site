## Reproduction Results

### Test Environment
- Python version: 3.13
- Pydantic version: 2.10.3
- llm package location: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages

### Bug Report Claims vs. Reality

**Bug Report Claim**: The `not_nulls()` function crashes with `ValueError: too many values to unpack` when called with a Pydantic model because iterating over a Pydantic model yields field names as strings.

**Actual Behavior**: The code works perfectly without any errors. When iterating over a Pydantic BaseModel instance in Pydantic v2.10.3:
- Direct iteration yields tuples: `(field_name, field_value)`
- The unpacking `for key, value in data` works correctly
- The `not_nulls` function successfully filters out None values

### Test Results

1. **Direct Test with Actual Code**: The actual `not_nulls` function from `llm.default_plugins.openai_models` works without error when passed a `SharedOptions` instance.

2. **Iteration Behavior**: Pydantic models in this environment yield `(key, value)` tuples when iterated, NOT just field names as strings.

3. **Filtering Works Correctly**: The function correctly filters out None values and returns a dictionary with only non-None values.

### Evidence
- Created `SharedOptions(temperature=0.5, max_tokens=100)` and successfully called `not_nulls(opts)`
- Result: `{'temperature': 0.5, 'max_tokens': 100}` - correctly filtered out None values
- No ValueError occurred at any point

### Conclusion
The bug report is based on incorrect assumptions about how Pydantic models iterate. In Pydantic v2.x, iterating over a model instance yields `(field_name, field_value)` tuples, making the current `not_nulls` implementation correct. The proposed "fix" to add `.items()` would actually break the code since Pydantic models don't have an `.items()` method - they have `.model_dump().items()` instead.

The bug report appears to be either:
1. Based on a different version of Pydantic (possibly v1.x which had different iteration behavior)
2. A misunderstanding of how the code actually works
3. Testing with mock/stub code that doesn't accurately reflect Pydantic's actual behavior
