DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Function Documentation:
   - The encode() and decode() functions have NO docstrings
   - They are NOT included in the module's __all__ export list
   - This suggests they may be internal/private functions

2. Function Implementation:
   - encode() uses struct.pack with 'f' format (32-bit float)
   - decode() uses struct.unpack with 'f' format (32-bit float)
   - No documentation specifies the float precision limitation

3. Official Documentation Search:
   - No mention of encode/decode in the official LLM documentation at llm.datasette.io
   - No mention in the GitHub repository overview
   - No usage examples found in the codebase itself

4. Key Findings:
   - These appear to be undocumented internal functions
   - The float32 limitation is not documented anywhere
   - Users have no way to know about the precision limitations
   - The functions are not part of the public API

5. Implications:
   Since these functions are:
   a) Not documented
   b) Not in the public API (__all__)
   c) Have no docstrings

   They appear to be internal implementation details. However, the bug report claims they are used for "embedding vectors" and references usage in cli.py (though I couldn't find such usage at the specified line).

The lack of documentation means users cannot know about the float32 precision limitation. If these functions are intended to be used (even internally), the precision limitation should be documented or the functions should handle edge cases appropriately.
