## Documentation Analysis for validate_logit_bias

### Function Documentation
The validate_logit_bias function is a Pydantic field validator in the SharedOptions class. According to the code comments and field definition:

1. The logit_bias field is Optional[Union[dict, str]] with a default of None
2. The field description states: "Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Pass a JSON string like '{"1712":-100, "892":-100, "1489":-100}'"
3. The validator is supposed to:
   - Accept None and return None unchanged
   - Accept JSON strings and parse them into dictionaries
   - Accept dictionaries directly
   - Validate that keys can be converted to integers (token IDs)
   - Validate that values can be converted to integers between -100 and 100

### OpenAI API Specification
According to OpenAI's official documentation:
- logit_bias accepts a JSON object mapping token IDs to bias values
- Token IDs must be strings that represent integers
- Bias values must be integers between -100 and 100
- -100 typically blocks the token from being generated
- 100 makes the token much more likely to be generated
- The parameter maps token IDs (not text) to bias values

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify
The documentation does not explicitly state:
1. How to handle None values within the dictionary (e.g., {"1712": None})
2. Whether to silently skip invalid entries or raise errors
3. The specific error type or message format for invalid inputs

### Current Implementation Behavior
The current validator:
1. Correctly handles None input by returning None
2. Correctly parses JSON strings into dictionaries
3. Attempts to convert all dictionary values to integers without checking for None first
4. Raises a generic ValueError for any conversion failure

### Issue with the Bug Report
The bug report claims that passing {"1712": None} causes a TypeError instead of a "clear validation error." However, the code attempts to handle this in a try-except block that catches ValueError and re-raises it with the message "Invalid key-value pair in logit_bias dictionary". The problem is that int(None) raises TypeError, not ValueError, so the except block doesn't catch it.
