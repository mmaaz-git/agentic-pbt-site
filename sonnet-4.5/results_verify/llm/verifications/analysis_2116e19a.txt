TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against five possible categories:

1. **BUG** (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - The function name "remove_dict_none_values" clearly implies removing None values
   - The function already removes None values from dict values (line 86: if value is not None)
   - The function recursively processes lists, showing intent to handle nested structures
   - Inconsistent behavior: removes None from dict values but not from list elements
   - The usage context (cleaning API responses) suggests None values should be removed
   - The bug creates an asymmetry in the API that's counterintuitive

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly state that None values in lists should be removed
   - Current behavior has been in production (based on GitHub repo)

2. **INVALID** (Report is incorrect):
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Documentation only mentions "keys with value of None", not list elements
   - The function name has "dict" in it, possibly indicating dict-only behavior

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The function DOES recurse into lists (lines 91-92), showing intent to process them
   - The inconsistency between dict and list handling suggests a bug, not intentional design
   - No technical reason to preserve None in lists while removing from dicts

3. **WONTFIX** (Trivial/uninteresting bug):
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Could be considered an edge case
   - Existing code may depend on current behavior

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - This is not trivial - it affects data cleaning operations
   - The inconsistency can cause real issues when processing API responses
   - The fix is straightforward and improves function consistency

4. **FEATURE_REQUEST** (New functionality):
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Could argue that filtering None from lists is a new feature
   - Documentation doesn't promise this behavior

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The function already processes lists recursively
   - This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new capability
   - The function name implies this should already work

5. **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** (Documentation needs update):
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Documentation is incomplete about list handling
   - Could update docs to clarify that None values in lists are preserved

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The current behavior appears to be the bug, not the documentation
   - Updating docs to match buggy behavior doesn't fix the underlying issue
   - The function name and usage context suggest the behavior is wrong

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This is a **BUG**. The evidence strongly supports this categorization:

1. The function name "remove_dict_none_values" implies comprehensive None removal
2. The function already removes None values from dict values but inconsistently preserves them in lists
3. The function explicitly recurses into lists, showing intent to process them fully
4. The usage context (cleaning API responses) requires consistent None removal
5. The proposed fix aligns with the function's apparent purpose and improves consistency
6. The bug report correctly identifies the technical issue and provides a valid fix

The inconsistent behavior between dicts and lists is not a documentation issue or missing feature - it's a logic error in the implementation that contradicts the function's purpose.
