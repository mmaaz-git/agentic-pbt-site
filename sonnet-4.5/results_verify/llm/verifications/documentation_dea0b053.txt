## Documentation Analysis

### LLM Package Documentation

1. **No formal documentation exists for the cosine_similarity function**
   - The function has no docstring
   - No mention in README or documentation pages
   - No mention in the GitHub repository documentation
   - No mention in Simon Willison's blog posts about the tool

2. **Function Location**
   - Found in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/__init__.py`
   - Lines 458-462
   - It's a simple utility function without any error handling

3. **Expected Usage Context**
   - Based on GitHub issue #246, the function is used internally for embedding similarity calculations
   - Used for the `llm similar` command and `collection.similar()` method
   - Performs brute force similarity searches on embedding vectors

### Mathematical Definition

From Wikipedia and mathematical sources:
- Cosine similarity = A·B / (||A|| × ||B||)
- Mathematically undefined when either vector has zero magnitude (division by zero)
- Range: -1 to +1 for defined cases

### Industry Standards

1. **scikit-learn's Implementation**
   - Returns 0 for zero vectors instead of raising an error
   - Handles the edge case gracefully
   - Well-documented behavior

2. **Common Practices**
   - Most libraries either return 0 or NaN for zero vectors
   - Some raise specific exceptions explaining the issue
   - The behavior is typically documented

### Conclusion on Documentation

Since there is NO documentation for this function:
- The behavior for zero vectors is unspecified
- Users have no guidance on expected edge cases
- The function's purpose and limitations are not documented
- There's no specification of what errors might be raised

The lack of documentation means users cannot know in advance:
- Whether zero vectors are supported
- What exceptions might be raised
- What the expected behavior should be
