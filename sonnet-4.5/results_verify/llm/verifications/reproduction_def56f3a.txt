REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the not_nulls function. Here are my findings:

1. BUG CONFIRMATION
The bug is real and reproducible. When calling not_nulls() with a regular Python dict, it raises a ValueError with "not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" or "too many values to unpack (expected 2)".

2. ROOT CAUSE
The function implementation uses: `for key, value in data`
- When `data` is a Pydantic BaseModel (as used in production), iteration yields (key, value) tuples
- When `data` is a regular dict, iteration yields only keys (strings)
- Attempting to unpack a single string into two variables causes the ValueError

3. REPRODUCTION TESTS PERFORMED

Test 1: Direct reproduction with dict
Input: {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": None, "seed": 42}
Result: ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

Test 2: Hypothesis test with dict
Input: {"a": 1, "b": None}
Result: ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)

Test 3: Pydantic BaseModel behavior
Created a test Pydantic model and confirmed:
- Iterating over a Pydantic BaseModel yields (key, value) tuples
- The not_nulls implementation works correctly with Pydantic models
- The same logic fails with regular dicts

4. ACTUAL USAGE IN CODEBASE
The function is only used once at line 658:
`kwargs = dict(not_nulls(prompt.options))`

Where `prompt.options` is a Pydantic BaseModel instance (confirmed by checking llm.Options class).
This explains why the bug hasn't surfaced in production - it's never called with a regular dict.

5. TYPE SIGNATURE MISMATCH
The function signature `def not_nulls(data) -> dict:` is misleading:
- It suggests the input parameter `data` could be any type (implicitly `Any`)
- The return type correctly indicates it returns a dict
- But the implementation only works with objects that yield (key, value) tuples when iterated

The bug is confirmed and the report accurately describes the issue.
