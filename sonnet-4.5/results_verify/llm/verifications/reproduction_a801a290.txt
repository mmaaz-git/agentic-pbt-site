## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Results
1. **Hypothesis property-based test**: FAILED with "float division by zero"
   - The test immediately found the zero vector case that causes the crash

2. **Specific failing example from bug report**: CONFIRMED
   - Input: a = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], b = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
   - Result: ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero
   - This matches exactly what the bug report claimed

3. **Additional zero vector test cases**: ALL CRASH
   - Both vectors zero: ZeroDivisionError
   - Second vector zero: ZeroDivisionError
   - Single element zero vector: ZeroDivisionError

### Mathematical Verification
The manual calculation confirms the mathematical issue:
- When a = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], magnitude_a = 0.0
- The denominator becomes 0.0 * magnitude_b = 0.0
- Division by zero occurs: dot_product / 0.0

### Technical Analysis
The bug report is technically accurate:
1. The function does crash with ZeroDivisionError on zero vectors
2. The crash occurs exactly as described in the bug report
3. The mathematical explanation is correct - cosine similarity is undefined for zero vectors

### Key Finding
The function implements the standard cosine similarity formula without any special handling for the mathematically undefined case of zero vectors. This is a direct implementation that crashes when encountering the edge case rather than handling it gracefully.
