DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function: llm.utils.monotonic_ulid
Documentation Review for Clock Regression Bug

FUNCTION DOCSTRING
------------------
The function's docstring explicitly states:

"Return a ULID instance that is guaranteed to be *strictly larger* than every
other ULID returned by this function inside the same process."

Key promises:
1. STRICT MONOTONICITY: Each ULID must be "strictly larger" than all previous ones
2. SCOPE: Within the same process
3. REFERENCE: Claims to work "the same way the reference JavaScript `monotonicFactory` does"

DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR
-------------------
The docstring describes the implementation approach:
- Same millisecond: Increment the 80-bit randomness by one
- Clock moves forward: Generate fresh ULID with secure randomness
- Overflow: Raise OverflowError if >2^80 ULIDs in one millisecond

CRITICAL OMISSION: The docstring does NOT mention what happens when the clock moves BACKWARD.

COMPARISON WITH REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------------------------
Research on the JavaScript monotonicFactory reveals:
1. The JavaScript implementation DOES handle clock regression
2. Quote from JavaScript docs: "Even if a lower timestamp is passed (or generated), it will preserve sort order"
3. Example: ulid(100000) after ulid(150000) still produces a larger ULID

The Python implementation claims to work "the same way" as JavaScript but FAILS to implement
the clock regression handling.

ULID SPECIFICATION
------------------
The official ULID spec (github.com/ulid/spec):
- Does not explicitly mandate handling of clock regression
- Focuses on monotonicity within the same millisecond
- Leaves clock regression handling as an implementation detail

DOCUMENTATION VERDICT
---------------------
1. The function's core promise is VIOLATED: It does not guarantee "strictly larger" ULIDs
   when clock regression occurs.

2. The claim of working "the same way" as JavaScript monotonicFactory is FALSE: The JavaScript
   version handles clock regression, but the Python version does not.

3. The docstring's omission of clock regression behavior is a documentation gap, but the
   explicit guarantee of "strictly larger" makes the current behavior incorrect.

CONCLUSION
----------
The documentation clearly promises monotonic behavior ("strictly larger") without exception.
The current implementation violates this documented guarantee when clocks move backward.
This is not just a documentation issue - it's a violation of the documented contract.

Additionally, the claim to work like the JavaScript reference implementation is incorrect,
as that implementation does handle clock regression while this one does not.
