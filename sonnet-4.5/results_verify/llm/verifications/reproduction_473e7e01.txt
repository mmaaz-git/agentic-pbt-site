BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

SUMMARY:
The bug report is ACCURATE. The function does violate its documented contract by returning strings longer than max_length when max_length is small (< 3).

SPECIFIC TEST CASE FROM BUG REPORT:
Input: truncate_string('00', max_length=1)
Expected: Result length <= 1
Actual: Result is '...' with length 3
Status: BUG CONFIRMED

ADDITIONAL TEST CASES PERFORMED:

1. text='00', max_length=1
   Result: '...' (length=3)
   VIOLATES CONTRACT (3 > 1)

2. text='abc', max_length=2
   Result: 'ab...' (length=5)
   VIOLATES CONTRACT (5 > 2)
   Note: This is even worse - it tries to do text[:2-3] + "..." which gives text[:-1] + "..." = 'ab...'

3. text='hello', max_length=3
   Result: '...' (length=3)
   DOES NOT VIOLATE (3 == 3)

4. text='test', max_length=0
   Result: 't...' (length=4)
   VIOLATES CONTRACT (4 > 0)
   Note: text[:0-3] gives text[:-3] which is 't', then adds '...'

5. text='', max_length=1
   Result: '' (length=0)
   DOES NOT VIOLATE (empty string is returned as-is on line 458)

6. text='x', max_length=1
   Result: 'x' (length=1)
   DOES NOT VIOLATE (string not truncated since len(text) <= max_length on line 463)

7. text='xy', max_length=1
   Result: '...' (length=3)
   VIOLATES CONTRACT (3 > 1)

HYPOTHESIS PROPERTY TEST:
The property-based test with Hypothesis confirmed the bug fails immediately with the same example: text='00', max_length=1.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The bug occurs in line 476 of the code:
    return text[: max_length - 3] + "..."

When max_length < 3:
- max_length=1: text[:-2] + "..." gives an unexpected slice result plus "..."
- max_length=2: text[:-1] + "..." gives partial text plus "..."
- max_length=0: text[:-3] + "..." gives partial text plus "..."

The function always appends "..." (3 chars) without checking if this would exceed max_length.

VERIFICATION OF BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
1. The bug exists: CONFIRMED
2. It happens for max_length < 3: CONFIRMED
3. The root cause is on line 476: CONFIRMED
4. The suggested fix would resolve it: LIKELY (not tested but logically sound)
