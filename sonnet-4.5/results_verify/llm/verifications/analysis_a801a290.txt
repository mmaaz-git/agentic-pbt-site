## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function has no documentation specifying what should happen with zero vectors. The implementation is a straightforward mathematical formula without any promises about handling edge cases. Since there's no documented contract about zero vector behavior, crashing with ZeroDivisionError could be considered the expected behavior for a basic mathematical implementation. The user is essentially complaining about undefined mathematical behavior that was never promised to be handled.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report accurately identifies a real crash that occurs with valid Python lists as input. The function accepts any lists and crashes on certain inputs without any documentation warning about this limitation. A reasonable user would expect either graceful handling or clear documentation about input constraints.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Zero vectors are an edge case that represents mathematically undefined behavior. The cosine similarity between zero vectors is genuinely undefined in mathematics, and there's no universally correct way to handle this. The current behavior (crashing) clearly signals to developers that they're doing something mathematically invalid. Adding special handling might hide real bugs in user code where zero vectors shouldn't occur.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a common enough edge case that many implementations handle it gracefully. The crash provides a poor developer experience, and the error message "float division by zero" doesn't clearly indicate the actual problem (zero vectors in cosine similarity). This is not an obscure edge case but a predictable scenario when working with vector data.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function lacks any documentation whatsoever - no docstring, no parameter descriptions, no mention of constraints. If the intended behavior is to crash on zero vectors, this should be documented. Adding a docstring that explicitly states "raises ZeroDivisionError when either vector has zero magnitude" would clarify the expected behavior and turn this from a bug into documented behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting a crash doesn't make for good API design. Most users would expect either graceful handling or at minimum a more descriptive error. Documentation alone doesn't solve the poor user experience of an undescriptive error message.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for new functionality - handling zero vectors gracefully. This could be seen as an enhancement request to add special case handling for mathematically undefined scenarios. The current implementation works correctly for all mathematically valid inputs (non-zero vectors), and the user wants it extended to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Handling edge cases that cause crashes is typically considered bug fixing, not feature addition. The function accepts the input without validation and then crashes, which is more of a robustness issue than a missing feature. Users shouldn't need to request "please don't crash" as a feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function accepts any lists as input without validation and crashes with an unclear error message on predictable inputs. There's no documentation warning about this limitation. The crash occurs on valid Python data structures that many users might reasonably pass to the function. Good software engineering practice suggests either validating inputs, handling edge cases, or at minimum providing clear error messages.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function correctly implements the mathematical formula for cosine similarity, which is genuinely undefined for zero vectors. The ZeroDivisionError accurately reflects the mathematical reality. Without explicit documentation promising to handle zero vectors, the function behaves exactly as the mathematical formula dictates. The implementation is not incorrect - it's just not defensive against mathematically undefined operations.

## Overall Consideration
Looking at all the considerations, this appears to be primarily a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** issue. The function implements a mathematical operation that has a well-known limitation (undefined for zero vectors), but this limitation is completely undocumented. The lack of any docstring, parameter documentation, or usage notes leaves users to discover this limitation through crashes.

While one could argue this is a bug (poor error handling) or a feature request (graceful zero vector handling), the core issue is that the function provides no guidance whatsoever about its expected inputs, outputs, or failure modes. A mathematical function that implements a formula with known undefined cases should document those cases. The current implementation is mathematically correct but lacks the documentation necessary for users to understand its limitations.

The fact that the function has zero documentation makes this fundamentally a documentation problem. Even if we decide not to change the behavior, users deserve to know that zero vectors will cause a crash. The most appropriate resolution would be to add comprehensive documentation explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and the fact that it raises ZeroDivisionError for zero vectors.
