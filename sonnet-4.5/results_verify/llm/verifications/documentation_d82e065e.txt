Documentation Analysis for combine_chunks Function
==================================================

## Function Location
The `combine_chunks` function is located in llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py and is an internal utility function used to combine streaming chunks from OpenAI API responses.

## Function Purpose
Based on code analysis, `combine_chunks` is used internally by the llm package to aggregate streaming response chunks from OpenAI-compatible APIs into a single combined response object.

## Documentation Status
- **No explicit documentation found**: The function has no docstring or comments explaining its intended behavior
- **No public API documentation**: This appears to be an internal utility function, not part of the public API
- **No test coverage found**: No unit tests specifically for this function were found in the codebase

## Usage Context
The function is called in three places within the same file:
1. Line 734: For chat completions with streaming
2. Line 832: For async chat completions with streaming
3. Line 900: For legacy completions with streaming

All calls wrap the result with `remove_dict_none_values()` to clean up None values.

## Expected Behavior (Inferred from Code)
Based on the implementation and usage:
1. Combines multiple streaming chunks into a single response dictionary
2. Accumulates content from all chunks
3. Tracks role, finish_reason, usage, and logprobs
4. Returns a dictionary with combined data

## OpenAI Streaming API Behavior
According to general OpenAI API documentation and common implementation patterns:
- The first chunk typically contains the role field (e.g., "assistant")
- Subsequent chunks have role=None since the role doesn't change
- This is standard behavior for OpenAI's streaming API

## Documentation Gap
The function lacks any specification for how it should handle the role field when:
- First chunk has role="assistant"
- Subsequent chunks have role=None

Without explicit documentation stating the expected behavior, it's unclear whether:
1. The role should be preserved from the first non-None value (as the bug report suggests)
2. The role should be overwritten with each chunk (current behavior)
3. Some other logic should apply

## Conclusion
The lack of documentation makes it impossible to definitively say whether the current behavior is correct or incorrect based solely on documentation. The bug report's expectation (preserving the first non-None role) seems reasonable based on how OpenAI's streaming API works, but without explicit documentation, this is an assumption about intended behavior rather than a documented requirement.
