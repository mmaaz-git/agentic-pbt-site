## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function behaves exactly as the mathematics dictates - cosine similarity is mathematically undefined for zero vectors, and the division by zero error accurately reflects this mathematical reality. Without any documentation specifying that zero vectors should be handled specially, the current behavior is technically correct from a pure mathematical standpoint. The function implements the mathematical formula directly without making assumptions about edge cases. Since there's no specification saying zero vectors should return 0.0 or any other value, claiming this is a "bug" could be considered invalid.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies that the function crashes with a ZeroDivisionError, which is a real issue that affects usability. Even without documentation, users reasonably expect library functions to handle edge cases gracefully rather than crashing. The report provides valid use cases where zero vectors might occur in production (empty documents, masked embeddings), making this a practical concern. Other major libraries like scikit-learn handle this case, setting a precedent for expected behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Zero vectors in cosine similarity calculations are edge cases that may indicate upstream data problems that should be fixed rather than masked. The ZeroDivisionError provides immediate feedback about problematic input data. Adding special handling for mathematically undefined operations could hide data quality issues. The function is simple and follows the mathematical definition exactly, which has value in itself. Users who need special handling can easily wrap the function themselves.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not an obscure edge case - zero vectors commonly occur in real applications (empty text, missing features, masked values). The fix is trivial (2-3 lines of code) and wouldn't complicate the implementation significantly. Many users would benefit from graceful handling rather than crashes. The current error message (ZeroDivisionError) doesn't explain what went wrong from a user perspective, making debugging harder.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function has absolutely no documentation - no docstring, no mention in README, not even listed in __all__. Adding documentation that explicitly states "raises ZeroDivisionError for zero vectors" would clarify the expected behavior. This would allow users to handle the exception appropriately. The mathematical undefinedness of cosine similarity for zero vectors is a known limitation that should be documented. Users could then make informed decisions about handling edge cases.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting that the function crashes doesn't solve the usability problem. Users still need graceful handling for production code. Most similar functions in other libraries handle zero vectors without crashing, so just documenting the crash wouldn't meet user expectations. The lack of any existing documentation suggests this might be an internal or experimental function that wasn't meant for public use.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current implementation is a bare mathematical formula without edge case handling. Adding zero vector handling would be adding a new capability the function doesn't currently have. This is essentially asking for the function to do something beyond its current scope - handling undefined mathematical operations gracefully. The request is for enhanced functionality rather than fixing broken behavior. Different applications might want different behaviors for zero vectors (0.0, NaN, None, exception), suggesting this is a feature design decision.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Graceful error handling is typically considered basic functionality, not a new feature. Users expect library functions to handle predictable edge cases. The function already exists and is exposed in the module - this is about making it production-ready, not adding new capabilities. Other cosine similarity implementations handle this by default, making it expected behavior rather than an extra feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with an unhelpful error message on valid input vectors (even if they're zero vectors, they're still valid Python lists). Production code using this function would crash unexpectedly when encountering zero vectors, which commonly occur in real applications. The error provides no useful information about what went wrong or how to fix it. Major libraries like scikit-learn handle this case gracefully, establishing it as expected behavior. The complete lack of documentation means users have no warning about this limitation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function correctly implements the mathematical formula for cosine similarity, which is undefined for zero vectors. The ZeroDivisionError accurately reflects the mathematical impossibility of the operation. Without documentation specifying expected behavior, the current implementation could be considered correct. The function might be internal or experimental, not intended for direct use. Crashing on mathematically undefined operations is defensible behavior.

**Overall consideration**
This bug report presents a complex triage decision. The function llm.cosine_similarity lacks any documentation whatsoever - no docstring, no README mention, and it's not even in the module's __all__ list. This suggests it might be an internal utility function not intended for public use. The function implements the mathematical formula for cosine similarity directly, and from a pure mathematics perspective, the ZeroDivisionError is correct since cosine similarity is undefined for zero vectors.

However, the bug report makes valid points about production usability. Zero vectors commonly occur in real applications (empty documents, missing features, masked embeddings), and having the function crash with an unhelpful error message is problematic for production code. The comparison to scikit-learn's behavior (returning 0.0) shows that there's an established convention for handling this edge case gracefully. The complete absence of documentation means users have no guidance on expected behavior or limitations.

Given that this appears to be an undocumented internal function, and that the current behavior is mathematically correct (even if not user-friendly), this seems most appropriately categorized as either INVALID (the function works as the math dictates, and without documentation saying otherwise, this isn't a bug) or DOCUMENTATION_FIX (the function should document its limitations). Since the function completely lacks documentation and appears to be an internal utility, and the reporter is asking for behavior that goes beyond what the mathematical definition provides, this leans toward INVALID.
