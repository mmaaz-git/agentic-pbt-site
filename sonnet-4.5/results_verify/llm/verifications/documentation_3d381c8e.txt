Documentation Analysis for truncate_string function
=====================================================

The truncate_string function is defined in llm/utils.py (lines 439-477). The function has the following docstring:

"""
Truncate a string to a maximum length, with options to normalize whitespace and keep both start and end.

Args:
    text: The string to truncate
    max_length: Maximum length of the result string
    normalize_whitespace: If True, replace all whitespace with a single space
    keep_end: If True, keep both beginning and end of string

Returns:
    Truncated string
"""

Key observations from the documentation:
1. The parameter is explicitly named "max_length" which semantically implies it's the maximum allowed length
2. The docstring states "Maximum length of the result string" - this is unambiguous
3. There is no qualification or exception mentioned for small values of max_length
4. There is no documentation saying that ellipsis ("...") takes priority over the max_length constraint

The function has special logic for keep_end=True requiring at least 9 characters, but there's no similar documented constraint for the basic truncation case.

No external documentation was found for this function in the llm documentation site. The function appears to be an internal utility function.

Based on the documentation alone, a reasonable user would expect that the returned string would never exceed max_length characters, regardless of the value of max_length.
