## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Considerations for Each Category

#### BUG
**Arguments against BUG:**
- The reported bug cannot be reproduced - the code works correctly
- The Hypothesis test passes without errors
- The simple reproduction test succeeds and returns the expected result
- The core claim about Pydantic v2 behavior is factually incorrect - Pydantic v2 BaseModel DOES yield (key, value) tuples when iterated
- The code has been working correctly with Pydantic v2.10.3

**Arguments for BUG:**
- None - there is no actual bug in the code

#### INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The fundamental premise of the bug report is incorrect
- The report claims "Pydantic v2 iteration yields only field names" but testing proves this is false
- Pydantic v2 BaseModel iteration yields (key, value) tuples, exactly what not_nulls expects
- The provided test cases pass without modification
- The "fix" in the bug report is unnecessary because the original code already works

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The reporter clearly put effort into creating a detailed bug report with test cases
- They may have encountered this issue in a different context or with a different version

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Could apply if this was a real bug but only affected an obscure edge case
- However, this is not a real bug, so WONTFIX doesn't apply

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- WONTFIX implies acknowledging a real issue exists but choosing not to fix it
- No actual issue exists here

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The proposed "fix" could be seen as making the code more defensive/robust
- Adding type checking could prevent future issues if Pydantic changes

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The current code works correctly
- Adding unnecessary defensive code for a non-existent problem is not a feature
- The reporter believed this was a bug, not requesting a new feature

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The not_nulls function has no documentation
- Could argue that documentation should clarify what types are expected

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- not_nulls is an internal utility function, not part of the public API
- Internal functions don't require documentation
- The bug report wasn't about documentation being unclear

### Analysis Summary

The bug report is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how Pydantic v2 BaseModel iteration works. The reporter incorrectly states that "Pydantic v2 iteration yields only field names (strings), not (key, value) tuples." This is demonstrably false - Pydantic v2 BaseModel iteration DOES yield (key, value) tuples.

Testing confirms:
1. The provided Hypothesis test passes
2. The simple reproduction code works correctly
3. Direct testing of Pydantic v2.10.3 shows it yields tuples when iterated
4. The not_nulls function works as designed with Pydantic BaseModel objects

The bug report appears to be based on either:
- A misunderstanding of Pydantic v2 behavior
- Testing with a different version or configuration
- Confusion with some other iteration method

Since the core claim is factually incorrect and the code works as intended, this should be categorized as INVALID.
