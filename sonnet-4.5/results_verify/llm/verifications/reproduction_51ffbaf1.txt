## Reproduction of Bug Report

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report for `llm.utils.truncate_string`.

### Test Results

1. **Manual test case provided in bug report**:
   - Input: `text = "Hello, World!"`, `max_length = 1`
   - Expected: Output length should be ≤ 1
   - Actual: Output was `"Hello, Worl..."` with length 14
   - **Bug confirmed**: The function violated the max_length constraint

2. **Additional test cases**:
   - `max_length=1` → returned string of length 14
   - `max_length=2` → returned string of length 15
   - Both cases violate the max_length constraint

3. **Property-based test using Hypothesis**:
   - The test failed as expected with minimal input
   - Failure case: `text='0'`, `max_length=1`
   - Result: `'...'` (length 3) > max_length of 1
   - This confirms systematic failure for small max_length values

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug occurs in line 476 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/utils.py`:
```python
return text[: max_length - 3] + "..."
```

When `max_length < 3`:
- `max_length - 3` becomes negative
- Python interprets `text[:negative]` as slicing from start to N characters from the end
- For example, with `max_length=1`: `text[:-2]` keeps all but last 2 chars of "Hello, World!" (getting "Hello, Worl")
- Then "..." is appended, resulting in "Hello, Worl..." (14 chars)

This directly violates the function's contract that the returned string should never exceed `max_length`.

### Conclusion

The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The function fails to honor its fundamental contract when `max_length < 3`.
