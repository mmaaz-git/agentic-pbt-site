## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Strong Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. **Clear Logic Error**: The code explicitly raises a specific error message "Value must be between -100 and 100" on line 427, but then immediately catches and replaces it with a generic message on line 428. This is clearly unintended behavior.

2. **Developer Intent**: The fact that the developer wrote a specific error message on line 427 shows clear intent to provide meaningful error feedback for out-of-range values.

3. **Poor User Experience**: Users cannot debug their logit_bias inputs effectively because all errors (invalid key, invalid value type, out-of-range value) produce the same generic message.

4. **API Compatibility**: The OpenAI API itself provides specific error messages for different validation failures. This wrapper library should maintain that level of error specificity.

5. **Code Structure Flaw**: The exception handling structure is objectively flawed - raising an exception just to immediately catch it and replace it with a less informative message serves no purpose.

### Considering WONTFIX

**Arguments AGAINST (weak):**
1. The function still correctly validates and rejects invalid inputs - it's only the error messages that are less specific.
2. Some might argue that generic error messages are sufficient for validation.

**Verdict**: These arguments are very weak. Error message quality matters for developer experience.

### Considering INVALID

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code does validate correctly - values outside [-100, 100] ARE rejected.
2. The ValueError is still raised, just with different text.

**Verdict**: While technically the validation works, the bug report is about the quality of error messages, which is a legitimate concern. The code's own attempt to provide specific messages shows this matters.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR:**
1. One could argue that "better error messages" is an enhancement rather than a bug.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code already attempts to provide specific error messages (line 427).
2. This is fixing broken exception handling logic, not adding new functionality.
3. The current behavior defeats the purpose of the specific error message that was already written.

**Verdict**: This is not a feature request - it's fixing broken error handling.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The code technically works as documented (validates logit_bias).

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not about documentation being wrong or unclear.
2. The issue is with the actual code implementation, not its documentation.
3. The fix requires changing code logic, not documentation.

**Verdict**: This is clearly not a documentation issue.

## Final Assessment

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The code contains a clear logic error where:
1. A specific, informative error message is raised for out-of-range values
2. That same error is immediately caught and replaced with a generic message
3. This defeats the developer's own intent (evidenced by writing the specific message)
4. It provides a poor debugging experience for users
5. It's inconsistent with standard error handling practices

The fix is straightforward and improves the code quality without changing its core functionality. This is a textbook example of a bug in exception handling logic.
