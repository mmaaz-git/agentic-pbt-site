## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the cosine_similarity function.

### Key Findings:

1. **The bug is real and reproducible**: When calling `llm.cosine_similarity([2.225073858507203e-309], [2.225073858507203e-309])`, the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`.

2. **Root cause confirmed**: The issue occurs due to floating-point underflow:
   - The input value is 2.225073858507203e-309 (extremely small, near Python's float minimum)
   - When squared (x * x), this value underflows to exactly 0.0
   - The magnitude calculation (sum of squares ** 0.5) results in 0.0
   - Division by (magnitude_a * magnitude_b) becomes division by 0, causing the error

3. **The hypothesis test also revealed another issue**: The test expects cosine_similarity(a, a) to always return 1.0, but this failed with a=[1.0, 1.0]. This suggests there might be a precision issue with the cosine similarity calculation even for normal values.

4. **The bug affects valid inputs**: The input value 2.225073858507203e-309 is a valid finite float (not NaN or infinity), so the function should handle it gracefully rather than crashing.

The bug report accurately describes the problem and provides a valid reproducible test case.
