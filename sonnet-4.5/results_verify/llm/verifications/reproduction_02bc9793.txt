# Bug Reproduction Report for truncate_string

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug in the `truncate_string` function. The function indeed violates the invariant that `len(result) <= max_length` for small values of `max_length`.

## Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test from the bug report runs correctly and fails as expected:
- Test failure: `AssertionError: Failed: len('...') = 3 > 1`
- Falsifying example: `text='00', max_length=1`

## Manual Testing Results

### Key Finding
The actual bug behavior is WORSE than what the bug report describes. The bug report states that when `max_length < 3`, the function returns "..." (3 characters). However, the actual behavior is that it incorrectly calculates the truncation position using `text[: max_length - 3] + "..."`.

### Test Results:
1. For `truncate_string("hello world", 1)`:
   - Expected (per invariant): Result with length ≤ 1
   - Actual: `'hello wor...'` with length 12 (NOT the "..." claimed in report)

2. For `truncate_string("hello world", 2)`:
   - Expected (per invariant): Result with length ≤ 2
   - Actual: `'hello worl...'` with length 13 (NOT the "..." claimed in report)

3. Edge case behavior:
   - When text length ≤ max_length, function correctly returns unmodified text
   - When text length > max_length and max_length < 3:
     - The function uses `text[: max_length - 3] + "..."`
     - When `max_length - 3` is negative, Python's slicing returns the entire string
     - Example: `text[:1-3]` = `text[:-2]` = all but last 2 characters
   - This causes the returned string to be much longer than max_length

### Code Analysis
The problematic code is in lines 474-476:
```python
else:
    # Fall back to simple truncation for very small max_length
    return text[: max_length - 3] + "..."
```

When `max_length` is 1 or 2:
- `max_length - 3` becomes -2 or -1
- `text[:-2]` or `text[:-1]` returns all but the last 2 or 1 characters
- Adding "..." results in strings much longer than the specified `max_length`

## Conclusion
The bug is confirmed and is actually MORE severe than the bug report describes. The function violates its documented invariant that the result should have `len(result) <= max_length`. While the proposed fix in the bug report would address the issue, the actual failure mode is different from what was reported (returning nearly the full string plus "..." rather than just "...").
