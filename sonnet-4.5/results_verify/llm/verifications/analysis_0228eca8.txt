# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
- The function crashes with an unhelpful error message (`ZeroDivisionError`) instead of providing meaningful feedback
- Zero vectors are valid Python lists/arrays that users might reasonably pass to the function
- The function is exposed in the public API (__all__ list) suggesting it should be robust
- Other implementations (NumPy, SciPy) handle this case more gracefully
- The error provides no context about what went wrong or how to fix it

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The mathematical definition of cosine similarity is undefined for zero vectors
- The current behavior technically matches the mathematical formula

## INVALID
**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
- Cosine similarity is mathematically undefined for zero vectors
- The function correctly implements the mathematical formula
- No documentation claims it should handle zero vectors
- Users should know that cosine similarity requires non-zero vectors

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is in a user-facing library and should handle edge cases gracefully
- Python functions typically provide helpful error messages for invalid inputs
- The crash is uninformative and doesn't guide users to the solution

## WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
- Zero vectors are an extreme edge case in practical embedding/similarity use cases
- Embeddings (the primary use case) are almost never zero vectors
- The mathematical operation is genuinely undefined

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - zero vectors can easily occur in practice
- The fix is trivial (a few lines of code)
- Better error handling improves user experience significantly

## FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The function never claimed to support zero vectors
- Handling zero vectors would be adding new functionality
- No documentation suggests this should work

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is about error handling, not new functionality
- The function already accepts the input (lists of numbers) but fails ungracefully
- Proper error handling is expected behavior, not a feature

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The function has no documentation at all
- Adding documentation about valid inputs would prevent user confusion
- The code behavior might be "correct" but needs to be documented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The issue is with the code crashing, not just missing documentation
- Even with documentation, the unhelpful error would remain
- Users expect functions to handle edge cases gracefully regardless of documentation

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Poor User Experience**: The function crashes with a cryptic `ZeroDivisionError` that doesn't explain what's wrong or how to fix it

2. **Public API Function**: The function is exposed in the public API and used internally, suggesting it should be robust

3. **Easy to Trigger**: Zero vectors can occur naturally in many scenarios (initialization, empty results, etc.)

4. **Standard Practice**: Well-designed libraries provide informative error messages for invalid inputs

5. **The Proposed Fix is Appropriate**: Raising a `ValueError` with a descriptive message ("cosine_similarity is undefined for zero vectors") is the correct solution

While the mathematical operation is indeed undefined for zero vectors, the function should handle this gracefully with a clear error message rather than allowing a low-level arithmetic error to surface. This aligns with Python's philosophy of explicit error handling and user-friendly APIs.
