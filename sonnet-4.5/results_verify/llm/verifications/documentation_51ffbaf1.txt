## Documentation Analysis for truncate_string

### Function Documentation (from docstring and source)

The `truncate_string` function in `llm/utils.py` has the following documented behavior:

**Purpose**: "Truncate a string to a maximum length, with options to normalize whitespace and keep both start and end."

**Parameters**:
- `text: str` - The string to truncate
- `max_length: int = 100` - Maximum length of the result string
- `normalize_whitespace: bool = False` - If True, replace all whitespace with a single space
- `keep_end: bool = False` - If True, keep both beginning and end of string

**Returns**: "Truncated string"

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **max_length parameter documentation**:
   - The docstring explicitly states `max_length` is the "Maximum length of the result string"
   - This creates a clear contract that the returned string should never exceed `max_length`
   - There is NO documentation about edge cases or minimum values for `max_length`
   - There is NO warning that the function might return strings longer than `max_length` for small values

2. **Implementation details from code comments**:
   - Comment on line 466: "# Minimum sensible length for keep_end is 9 characters: 'a... z'"
   - Comment on line 475: "# Fall back to simple truncation for very small max_length"
   - These comments suggest awareness of edge cases but don't indicate violation of the max_length contract

3. **External documentation**:
   - I searched extensively for external documentation about this function
   - Found no specific documentation on llm.datasette.io or in the GitHub repository
   - The function appears to be an internal utility not explicitly documented in public APIs

### Documentation Assessment

The documentation clearly establishes that `max_length` defines the "Maximum length of the result string". This is an unambiguous contract. There are no caveats, warnings, or exceptions mentioned that would suggest the function is allowed to return strings longer than `max_length` under any circumstances.

The parameter name itself (`max_length`) reinforces this contract - "max" universally means "maximum" or "not to exceed" in programming contexts.

### Conclusion

The documentation supports the bug report's claim. The function violates its documented contract by returning strings longer than `max_length` when `max_length < 3`.
