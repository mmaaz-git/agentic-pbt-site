DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
The cosine_similarity function in llm/__init__.py has:
- NO docstring
- NO inline comments
- NO parameter type hints
- NO return type hints
- NO documentation about expected inputs or behavior

2. EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION SEARCH:
- Searched the LLM package documentation at https://llm.datasette.io/
- Found NO mention of the cosine_similarity function
- The function appears to be an internal utility, likely for embedding comparisons

3. MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION:
According to Wikipedia and standard mathematical references:
- Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors
- Formula: cos(θ) = (A·B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
- CRITICAL: Cosine similarity is mathematically defined ONLY for:
  a) Vectors of the SAME dimensionality
  b) NON-ZERO vectors (to avoid division by zero)

4. USAGE IN CODEBASE:
Found usage in llm/embeddings.py:
- Used for comparing embedding vectors in distance_score function
- Called with decoded embedding vectors
- Embeddings should always have the same dimensions by design

5. ASSUMPTIONS IN BUG REPORT:
The bug report correctly assumes:
- Cosine similarity requires equal-length vectors (mathematically correct)
- The function should reject mismatched dimensions (standard practice)
- Silent truncation is incorrect behavior (data integrity principle)

6. DOCUMENTATION VERDICT:
While there is NO explicit documentation stating the function should handle mismatched vector lengths, the mathematical definition of cosine similarity INHERENTLY requires equal-dimension vectors. The lack of documentation does not excuse incorrect mathematical implementation.

The bug report's assumptions are valid based on:
- Mathematical correctness
- Standard software engineering practices (fail fast, validate inputs)
- Data integrity principles (don't silently corrupt data)
