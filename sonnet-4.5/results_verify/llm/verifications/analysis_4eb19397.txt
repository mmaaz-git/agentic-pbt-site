## Triage Analysis for Bug Report

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: The function treats empty dicts differently based on context - removing them as direct values but preserving them in lists. This inconsistency is unexpected and likely unintentional.

2. **Function name implies comprehensive removal**: The function is named `remove_dict_none_values`, suggesting it should remove None values throughout the structure, not selectively.

3. **Recursive promise not fulfilled**: The docstring says "recursively remove" but the recursion doesn't consistently apply the same filtering logic to list contents.

4. **Practical impact**: This inconsistency can cause problems for downstream code that expects a clean data structure without None values or empty containers.

5. **Clear fix available**: The bug report provides a reasonable fix that makes the behavior consistent.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. **Documentation ambiguity**: The docstring says "remove keys with value of None" - technically, list elements aren't "keys", so one could argue the function only promises to handle dictionary keys.

2. **Possible intentional design**: Lists might intentionally preserve structure to maintain indices or array positions.

**Counter-arguments:**
- The function already processes lists recursively (line 92), so it's clearly meant to handle list contents
- The inconsistency between handling dicts directly vs in lists suggests oversight rather than design

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. **Existing behavior might be relied upon**: Current users of the library might depend on None values being preserved in lists.

2. **Edge case**: The specific scenario of empty dicts in lists might be rare in practice.

**Counter-arguments:**
- The function is used for cleaning API responses, where consistent behavior is important
- The fix is straightforward and improves consistency

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. **Ambiguous documentation**: The current docstring doesn't clearly specify the expected behavior for lists.

2. **Code works as implemented**: One could argue the code is correct and the documentation should be updated to clarify the behavior.

**Counter-arguments:**
- The inconsistent behavior (empty dicts removed in one context but not another) is illogical and likely unintended
- Simply documenting the inconsistency doesn't make it correct behavior

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. **New functionality**: Filtering None values from lists could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix.

2. **Enhancement**: Making the behavior consistent could be viewed as an enhancement request.

**Counter-arguments:**
- The function already processes lists, just inconsistently
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new capabilities
- The docstring says "recursively remove", implying comprehensive removal

## Final Analysis

The strongest case is for **BUG** classification because:

1. **Clear inconsistency**: The function removes empty dicts when they're direct values but keeps them when they're in lists. This inconsistency in treating the same data structure differently based on context is a logic error.

2. **Recursive promise**: The docstring promises to "recursively remove" None values, but the recursion applies different logic to lists vs dicts.

3. **Practical impact**: When processing API responses (the primary use case), having empty dicts and None values remain in lists while being removed elsewhere creates unpredictable data structures.

4. **Not edge case behavior**: This affects any data structure with lists containing dicts or None values, which is common in API responses.

5. **Clear user expectation**: Users would reasonably expect consistent filtering behavior throughout the data structure.

The behavior is neither documented as intentional nor logical from a design perspective. The fix is straightforward and improves consistency without breaking the core functionality.
