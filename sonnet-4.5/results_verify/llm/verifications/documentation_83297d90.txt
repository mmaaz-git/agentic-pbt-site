DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR llm.cosine_similarity
================================================

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION STATUS
The cosine_similarity function in llm/__init__.py has NO documentation whatsoever:
- No docstring
- No inline comments
- No type hints
- No parameter descriptions
- No return value description
- No behavior specification for edge cases

2. EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION SEARCH
Searched for documentation in:
- The LLM package documentation at https://llm.datasette.io/
- The GitHub repository at https://github.com/simonw/llm
- Package metadata and README files
Result: No specific documentation found for the cosine_similarity function behavior or edge cases.

3. GENERAL MATHEMATICAL CONTEXT FOR COSINE SIMILARITY

Based on mathematical references and other implementations:

a) Mathematical Definition:
   - Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors
   - Formula: cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
   - Mathematically UNDEFINED for zero vectors

b) Common Implementations in Other Libraries:
   - scikit-learn: Discussion exists about returning NaN for zero vectors (GitHub issue #15256)
   - NumPy/SciPy: Various implementations handle it differently
   - PyTorch: Adds small epsilon to avoid division by zero

c) Mathematical Consensus:
   - Cosine similarity with zero vectors is mathematically undefined
   - Most rigorous implementations return NaN (Not a Number)
   - Some implementations return 0.0 as a pragmatic choice
   - Some raise explicit errors with informative messages

4. IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS BUG

Since there is NO documentation specifying:
- What the function should do with zero vectors
- Whether it should raise an exception or return a special value
- What the intended behavior is for edge cases

The bug report's assumption that the function should handle zero vectors gracefully is REASONABLE but not explicitly documented. The function appears to be a utility function that implements the basic mathematical formula without any edge case handling.

5. DOCUMENTATION VERDICT

The lack of documentation means:
- Users have no guidance on expected behavior
- The current ZeroDivisionError is technically not violating any documented contract
- However, a raw ZeroDivisionError is poor user experience compared to either:
  * Returning a mathematically appropriate value (NaN or 0.0)
  * Raising a more informative error (ValueError with explanation)
