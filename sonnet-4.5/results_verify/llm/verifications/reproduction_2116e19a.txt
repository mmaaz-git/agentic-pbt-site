REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed:

1. **Hypothesis Test Verification**:
   - The provided hypothesis test fails as reported
   - Found failing case: {'': [None]} returns {'': [None]} (None value preserved)
   - The test correctly identifies that None values remain in lists after processing

2. **Specific Example Reproduction**:
   - Input: {'choices': [None, {'text': 'response'}]}
   - Output: {'choices': [None, {'text': 'response'}]}
   - The None value in the list is preserved when it should be removed

3. **Code Analysis**:
   Looking at lines 91-92 in utils.py:
   ```python
   elif isinstance(value, list):
       new_dict[key] = [remove_dict_none_values(v) for v in value]
   ```

   The issue is that when a list contains None values, the function calls
   remove_dict_none_values(None), which returns None (lines 82-83). This None
   is then included in the list comprehension result, preserving the None values.

4. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function correctly removes None values from dict values (line 86)
   - The function correctly recurses into nested dicts (lines 87-90)
   - The function INCORRECTLY preserves None values in lists (lines 91-92)
   - This creates inconsistent behavior between dict and list handling

The bug is real and affects the function's ability to clean up data structures
containing lists with None values.
