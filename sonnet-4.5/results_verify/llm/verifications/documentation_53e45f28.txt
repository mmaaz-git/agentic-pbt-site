Documentation Analysis
======================

Documentation Sources Reviewed:
------------------------------
1. Function docstring in llm/utils.py (lines 445-456)
2. Python help() documentation (generated from docstring)
3. Inline code comments

Key Documentation Findings:
--------------------------

1. The docstring explicitly states for the max_length parameter:
   "max_length: Maximum length of the result string"

   This is an unambiguous contract that the returned string should not exceed max_length characters.

2. There are NO documented exceptions or special cases mentioned for small values of max_length.

3. The comment on line 475 says "Fall back to simple truncation for very small max_length" but doesn't specify that this "simple truncation" might violate the max_length contract.

4. The comment on line 466 mentions "Minimum sensible length for keep_end is 9 characters" and the code handles this case correctly by only using keep_end mode when max_length >= 9. However, there's no similar safeguard for the default truncation mode.

5. No external documentation (README, docs, etc.) was found that would contradict or modify the understanding of the max_length parameter.

Conclusion:
----------
The documentation clearly establishes that max_length is the "Maximum length of the result string" with no exceptions noted. The current behavior for max_length < 3 directly violates this documented contract. There is no documentation suggesting that extremely small max_length values should be handled differently or that the function is allowed to return strings longer than max_length in any case.
