Bug Reproduction Analysis
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in llm.default_plugins.openai_models.redact_data.

Test Results:
1. The Hypothesis property-based test fails as reported, confirming that the function mutates its input.
2. The direct reproduction code confirms all three assertions:
   - The original dictionary IS mutated (original != original_copy)
   - The original dictionary's image_url.url field is changed to "data:..."
   - The returned result IS the same object as the input (result is original)

The bug is real and reproducible. The function modifies the input dictionary in-place at lines 982 and 984 of openai_models.py:
- Line 982: value["url"] = "data:..."
- Line 984: value["data"] = "..."

These lines directly mutate the input dictionary's nested values instead of creating a new structure.

Effect of the bug:
- Any code that calls redact_data() and expects the original data to remain unchanged will experience unexpected side effects
- If the same dictionary is used elsewhere in the program, it will be unexpectedly modified
- This violates the principle of immutability for data transformation functions
- Could lead to subtle bugs in production where sensitive data structures are accidentally modified
