## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report is confirmed to be accurate. The `not_nulls` function has a clear implementation error that causes it to crash on any non-empty dictionary input.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Manual Test with Provided Example:**
   - Input: `{'temperature': 0.7, 'max_tokens': None, 'top_p': 0.9}`
   - Error: `ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)`
   - Expected behavior: Should return `{'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.9}`

2. **Simple Test Case:**
   - Input: `{'a': 1}`
   - Error: `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)`
   - This confirms the bug happens with any non-empty dict

3. **Property-Based Testing:**
   - Using Hypothesis with random dictionaries confirms the bug is systematic
   - The only case that doesn't crash is an empty dictionary `{}`
   - All non-empty dictionaries fail with ValueError

### Root Cause
The bug occurs because the function iterates over a dict directly:
```python
for key, value in data  # Wrong - iterates over keys only
```

When iterating over a dict directly in Python, you only get the keys, not (key, value) tuples. The correct approach is:
```python
for key, value in data.items()  # Correct - iterates over (key, value) pairs
```

### Impact
- This is a critical bug that makes the function completely unusable for its intended purpose
- The function will crash on any non-empty dictionary input
- Since this function is used in `build_kwargs` (line 658), it would prevent any OpenAI model from being used

### Verification of Fix
The proposed fix (`data.items()` instead of `data`) successfully resolves the issue:
- All test cases pass with the fixed version
- The function correctly filters out None values as intended
