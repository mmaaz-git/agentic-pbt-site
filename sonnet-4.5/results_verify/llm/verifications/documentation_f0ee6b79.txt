## Documentation Analysis for llm.cosine_similarity

### Source Code Location
The function is implemented in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/__init__.py` at lines 458-462:

```python
def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    dot_product = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    magnitude_a = sum(x * x for x in a) ** 0.5
    magnitude_b = sum(x * x for x in b) ** 0.5
    return dot_product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
```

### Documentation Found
The function has **NO DOCUMENTATION** beyond its signature. When checking with `help(llm.cosine_similarity)`, it only shows:
- Function signature: `cosine_similarity(a, b)`
- No docstring
- No description of expected behavior
- No specification of input requirements or constraints
- No specification of error handling

### Mathematical Context
Cosine similarity is a well-established mathematical concept used to measure the similarity between two vectors in an inner product space. Mathematically:
- cos(θ) = (a · b) / (||a|| × ||b||)
- The result ranges from -1 (opposite direction) to 1 (same direction)
- When either vector has zero magnitude, the cosine is mathematically undefined

### Key Documentation Findings
1. **No preconditions specified**: The function does not document any requirements about the input vectors (e.g., non-zero magnitude)
2. **No error behavior specified**: The function does not document what should happen with edge cases like zero vectors
3. **No return value specification**: While cosine similarity mathematically returns values in [-1, 1], this is not documented
4. **No type hints**: The function lacks type annotations to indicate expected input/output types

### Implications
Without documentation specifying:
- Whether zero vectors are valid input
- What the expected behavior should be for zero vectors
- Whether exceptions are expected to be raised

The current behavior (raising ZeroDivisionError) cannot definitively be called incorrect based on documentation alone. The behavior is neither explicitly allowed nor explicitly forbidden by the (non-existent) documentation.
