## Documentation Analysis for validate_logit_bias

### Official OpenAI API Documentation

Based on web search results and OpenAI documentation:

1. **Valid Range**: The logit_bias parameter accepts values from -100 to 100 (inclusive)
   - Values outside this range will result in API errors
   - -100 effectively blocks a token from being generated
   - 100 makes a token extremely likely to be selected

2. **Format Requirements**:
   - Keys should be token IDs (integers)
   - Values should be integers between -100 and 100
   - The parameter can be passed as a dictionary or JSON string

3. **Error Handling Expectations**:
   - The OpenAI API returns a "Bad Request" error for values outside the valid range
   - The API expects clear error messages when validation fails
   - Different error conditions (invalid keys vs out-of-range values) should be distinguishable

### Code Documentation (from Field description)

The SharedOptions class documents logit_bias as:
- "Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion"
- Example format: '{"1712":-100, "892":-100, "1489":-100}'
- Can accept either a dict or string (JSON)

### Expected Behavior Analysis

The validate_logit_bias method is clearly intended to:
1. Accept None and return None unchanged
2. Parse JSON strings into dictionaries
3. Convert string keys to integer token IDs
4. Convert values to integers
5. Validate that values are within [-100, 100] range
6. Return a validated dictionary with integer keys and values

### Error Message Standards

Based on common programming practices and the code's own attempt:
- Different error conditions should produce different, specific error messages
- The code on line 427 DOES attempt to provide a specific message: "Value must be between -100 and 100"
- This indicates the developer's intent was to provide clear, specific error messages

### Conclusion on Documentation

The documentation and code intent clearly support having specific error messages for different validation failures:
1. Invalid JSON format → "Invalid JSON in logit_bias string"
2. Non-numeric keys → Should indicate key conversion failure
3. Non-numeric values → Should indicate value conversion failure
4. Out-of-range values → "Value must be between -100 and 100"

The current implementation violates this principle by catching and replacing the specific out-of-range error with a generic message. This is counter to both:
- The OpenAI API's behavior (which provides specific error messages)
- The code's own attempted behavior (raising specific error on line 427)
- General best practices for user-facing error messages
