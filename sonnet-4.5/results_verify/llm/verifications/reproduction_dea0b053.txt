## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report.

### Test Results

1. **Direct reproduction with the provided inputs:**
   - Input: `a = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`, `b = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`
   - Output: `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`
   - This confirms the bug - the function crashes with ZeroDivisionError

2. **Additional test cases:**
   - Both vectors zero: `a = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`, `b = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`
     - Result: `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`

   - Second vector zero: `a = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`, `b = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`
     - Result: `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`

3. **Hypothesis test results:**
   - The test correctly identifies that the function raises `ZeroDivisionError` instead of `ValueError`
   - The test expectation that it should raise `ValueError` is what the bug reporter wants

### Code Analysis

Looking at the implementation in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/__init__.py` lines 458-462:

```python
def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    dot_product = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    magnitude_a = sum(x * x for x in a) ** 0.5
    magnitude_b = sum(x * x for x in b) ** 0.5
    return dot_product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
```

The function computes the magnitudes and then divides by their product. When either magnitude is zero, the division `dot_product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)` causes a ZeroDivisionError.

### Bug Effect

The bug causes the function to crash with an unhelpful `ZeroDivisionError` when either input vector has zero magnitude. This is problematic because:
1. The error message doesn't explain what went wrong
2. Users might not immediately understand that zero-magnitude vectors cause the issue
3. It's a known mathematical edge case in cosine similarity (undefined for zero vectors)
