# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation
The `llm.cosine_similarity` function has **NO DOCUMENTATION** in the source code:
- No docstring
- No inline comments
- No type hints
- No parameter descriptions
- No return value description
- No error handling documentation

## External Documentation Search
1. **LLM Package Documentation**: No mention of `cosine_similarity` function found in the official documentation at llm.datasette.io

2. **Source Code Context**: The function is used internally in `embeddings.py` for calculating distance scores between encoded vectors

3. **Mathematical Definition** (from Wikipedia):
   - Cosine similarity is defined as: cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)
   - Wikipedia states it's "a measure of similarity between two **non-zero vectors**" (emphasis added)
   - The mathematical formula inherently requires non-zero vectors to avoid division by zero
   - When either vector has zero magnitude, the result is mathematically undefined

## Key Findings

1. **No Specification of Expected Behavior**: The function lacks any documentation about:
   - What inputs are valid
   - What errors might be raised
   - How edge cases should be handled
   - Whether zero vectors are supported or not

2. **Mathematical Context**:
   - Cosine similarity is mathematically undefined for zero vectors
   - Standard mathematical libraries typically either:
     a) Return NaN (not a number)
     b) Return 0.0 (by convention)
     c) Raise a descriptive error explaining zero vectors are not supported

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - Simply implements the mathematical formula without any edge case handling
   - Allows the natural `ZeroDivisionError` to bubble up
   - Provides no context about why the error occurred

## Conclusion
The lack of documentation means there is NO SPECIFIED BEHAVIOR for how zero vectors should be handled. The current implementation follows the basic mathematical formula which naturally fails on zero vectors, but this is neither documented nor explicitly handled.
