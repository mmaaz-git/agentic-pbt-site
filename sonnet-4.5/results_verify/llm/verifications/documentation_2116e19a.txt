DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. **Function Documentation**:
   The function has a docstring that states:
   "Recursively remove keys with value of None or value of a dict that is all values of None"

2. **Documentation Issues**:
   - The documentation ONLY mentions removing "keys with value of None" and "dict that is all values of None"
   - The documentation does NOT mention how lists are handled
   - The documentation does NOT specify whether None values inside lists should be removed or preserved
   - The documentation is ambiguous about the complete behavior of the function

3. **Usage Context**:
   The function is used in openai_models.py to clean API responses:
   - `response.response_json = remove_dict_none_values(completion.model_dump())`
   - Used after combining chunks and processing completions
   - The context suggests it's meant to clean up API response data

4. **Expected vs Actual Behavior**:
   Based on the function name and documentation:
   - Name: "remove_dict_none_values" suggests removing None values from dict structures
   - Documentation: Mentions recursive removal, but only for dict keys with None values
   - Implementation: Recurses into lists but doesn't filter None values from them

5. **Documentation Completeness**:
   The documentation is INCOMPLETE because:
   - It doesn't specify the behavior for lists
   - It doesn't clarify whether None values within lists should be preserved
   - The recursive nature mentioned applies to dicts but the list behavior is unspecified

6. **Interpretation**:
   Given that:
   - The function recursively processes lists (line 91-92)
   - The function name implies removing None values
   - The usage is for cleaning API responses

   There are two possible interpretations:
   a) The current behavior is correct, and the documentation should be updated to clarify that None values in lists are preserved
   b) The behavior is incorrect, and None values should be removed from lists to match the function's apparent purpose

   The bug report's interpretation (b) seems more reasonable given the function's name and usage context for cleaning data.
