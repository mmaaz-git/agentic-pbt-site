## Documentation Analysis for truncate_string

### Available Documentation

The only documentation available for the `truncate_string` function is the docstring embedded in the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/utils.py` lines 445-456:

```python
"""
Truncate a string to a maximum length, with options to normalize whitespace and keep both start and end.

Args:
    text: The string to truncate
    max_length: Maximum length of the result string
    normalize_whitespace: If True, replace all whitespace with a single space
    keep_end: If True, keep both beginning and end of string

Returns:
    Truncated string
"""
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Function Purpose**: The docstring clearly states the function will "Truncate a string to a maximum length"

2. **max_length Parameter**: The documentation explicitly describes this as "Maximum length of the result string"

3. **Return Value**: Described simply as "Truncated string"

### Critical Analysis

The documentation creates an unambiguous contract that:
- The function WILL truncate a string to a maximum length
- The `max_length` parameter defines the MAXIMUM length of the RESULT string
- No exceptions or special cases are mentioned where this constraint might be violated

### External Documentation

I attempted to find additional documentation from:
- The package's official documentation at https://llm.datasette.io/
- The GitHub repository at https://github.com/simonw/llm
- The package metadata

However, no additional documentation was found for this specific utility function. The function appears to be an internal utility that's not documented in the public API documentation.

### Conclusion on Documentation

The docstring creates a clear contract that `len(result) <= max_length` must always hold true. There are:
- NO documented exceptions for small values of max_length
- NO documented minimum length requirements
- NO warnings about ellipsis adding to the length

The documentation unequivocally states that `max_length` is the "Maximum length of the result string", making any violation of this constraint a legitimate bug, not a documentation issue.
