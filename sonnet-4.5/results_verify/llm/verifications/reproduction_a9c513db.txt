## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report is CORRECT. The `truncate_string` function does violate its documented contract by returning strings longer than `max_length` when `max_length < 3`.

### Property-Based Test Results
The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report fails immediately, confirming the issue exists.

### Specific Failing Case Analysis
The bug report claimed:
- Input: `text = "hello", max_length = 1`
- Expected: Result should be at most 1 character long
- Actual: Result is 'hel...' (6 characters)

My reproduction confirms this, though with a slight difference from the bug report's claimed output:
- Bug report claimed output: '...' (3 chars)
- Actual output: 'hel...' (6 chars)

The bug is actually WORSE than reported - it produces even longer strings than the report claimed.

### Root Cause Analysis
When `max_length < 3`, the code does: `text[:max_length - 3] + "..."`

For `max_length = 1`:
- Calculates slice as `text[:-2]` (negative index)
- In Python, `"hello"[:-2]` returns `"hel"` (all but last 2 chars)
- Appends "..." making final result "hel..." (6 chars)
- This is 6x longer than the requested max_length of 1

For `max_length = 2`:
- Calculates slice as `text[:-1]` (negative index)
- `"hello"[:-1]` returns `"hell"`
- Appends "..." making final result "hell..." (7 chars)
- This is 3.5x longer than the requested max_length of 2

### Additional Edge Cases Tested
- `truncate_string("a", 0)` returns "..." (3 chars) - violates constraint
- `truncate_string("ab", 0)` returns "..." (3 chars) - violates constraint
- `truncate_string("ab", 1)` returns "..." (3 chars) - violates constraint
- `truncate_string("abc", 1)` returns "a..." (4 chars) - violates constraint
- `truncate_string("abcd", 2)` returns "abc..." (6 chars) - violates constraint

### Technical Verification
The function's docstring states: "Truncate a string to a maximum length"
The parameter is documented as: "max_length: Maximum length of the result string"

The word "maximum" unambiguously means the result should not exceed this length. The current implementation clearly violates this contract for small values of max_length.

The bug is reproducible, technically accurate, and represents a clear violation of the documented behavior.
