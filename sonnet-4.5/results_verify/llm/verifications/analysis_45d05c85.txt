## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function has absolutely no documentation specifying its expected behavior. Without documentation stating that zero vectors should be handled gracefully, the current behavior (raising ZeroDivisionError) is not technically incorrect. The mathematical definition of cosine similarity explicitly states it's for "non-zero vectors," so expecting it to work with zero vectors contradicts the mathematical foundation. The bug report assumes behavior that was never promised or specified. Additionally, cosine_similarity is not even in the __all__ list, suggesting it might be an internal utility function not intended for public use with guaranteed behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function is publicly accessible and the name "cosine_similarity" strongly implies a standard mathematical operation. Users have reasonable expectations that public functions won't crash with common edge cases. Zero vectors can naturally occur in real-world data (e.g., empty embeddings, sparse vectors), so handling them is a practical necessity. The crash with ZeroDivisionError is undeniably happening and prevents the function from being robust.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a mathematical edge case that occurs when using the function incorrectly (with zero vectors that violate the mathematical definition). The error message "float division by zero" is clear enough for developers to understand what went wrong. Zero vectors in cosine similarity calculations usually indicate a data problem that should be fixed upstream rather than masked. The function is possibly internal (not in __all__), so edge case handling may not be a priority. Changing the behavior now could break existing code that relies on the exception being raised.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
ZeroDivisionError is not a descriptive error for end users who may not understand the mathematical implementation details. The issue affects real-world usage scenarios where zero vectors can legitimately appear. Many major ML libraries handle this case gracefully, setting a precedent. The fix is trivial to implement and wouldn't significantly impact performance. The current behavior makes the function fragile and unsuitable for production use without wrapper code.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function completely lacks documentation, which is the root cause of the confusion. Adding documentation that explicitly states "This function requires non-zero vectors and will raise ZeroDivisionError for zero vectors" would clarify the expected behavior. The current implementation is mathematically correct for non-zero vectors, so the code doesn't need changing, just the documentation. This would set proper expectations and prevent future bug reports about the same issue.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting the current crash behavior doesn't make the function more useful or robust. Users encountering zero vectors still need to handle the exception, which is poor API design. Documentation alone doesn't solve the practical problem that users face. If the function is meant for public use, it should be robust enough to handle edge cases gracefully rather than just documenting that it crashes.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current implementation correctly implements the mathematical definition of cosine similarity for non-zero vectors. Adding zero vector handling would be extending the function beyond its current mathematical scope. The bug report is essentially asking for new functionality: graceful handling of an edge case that the original implementation didn't account for. Different users might want different behaviors for zero vectors (return 0, return NaN, raise a specific exception), so this is really a request for enhanced functionality rather than fixing broken behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Handling zero vectors isn't really a "new feature" but rather making the existing feature production-ready. The function name implies it should calculate cosine similarity whenever possible, not just for a subset of inputs. Error handling and edge case management are typically considered bug fixes or robustness improvements, not new features. The user isn't asking for new capabilities but for the existing capability to not crash.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with an unhandled exception on a predictable edge case that can occur in real-world usage. Production-quality code should handle edge cases gracefully rather than crashing. The ZeroDivisionError is an implementation detail leaking through the abstraction. Most users would expect either a meaningful error message or a sensible default value rather than a crash. The lack of any error handling for a known mathematical edge case suggests an oversight in the implementation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There is no documentation claiming the function handles zero vectors, so it's not failing to meet its specification. The mathematical definition of cosine similarity explicitly excludes zero vectors, so the crash is mathematically justified. The error (ZeroDivisionError) accurately describes what went wrong. Without documented expected behavior, the current behavior cannot be considered incorrect. Many mathematical functions in Python (like math.log(0)) raise exceptions for undefined operations rather than returning special values.

## Overall consideration
After examining all aspects, this bug report appears to be INVALID rather than a true bug. The primary reason is that the function has no documentation whatsoever specifying its expected behavior, and the mathematical definition of cosine similarity explicitly states it's for non-zero vectors. The function is doing exactly what the mathematics dictates: attempting division by zero when given zero vectors. Without any promise or specification that zero vectors should be handled gracefully, the current behavior cannot be considered incorrect.

The fact that cosine_similarity is not even listed in the module's __all__ export list suggests it might be an internal utility function rather than a public API with guaranteed behavior. Internal functions often have less robust error handling because they're expected to be called with valid inputs by other parts of the library. If this is indeed an internal function, expecting it to handle all edge cases gracefully is unreasonable.

While the bug report is technically accurate about the function crashing with zero vectors, and the proposed fixes would work, this doesn't make it a valid bug. The report makes assumptions about expected behavior that were never documented or promised. The appropriate response would be to either add documentation clarifying that zero vectors are not supported (DOCUMENTATION_FIX) or treat this as a feature request for enhanced robustness (FEATURE_REQUEST), but it's not a BUG because the function isn't failing to meet any stated specification.
