BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The round-trip property is violated: decode(encode(x)) != x for certain values
   - This causes silent data corruption (values become 0)
   - The behavior is unexpected and undocumented

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Functions are not in the public API (__all__)
   - No documentation promises round-trip behavior
   - Float32 precision limitations are a known property of the format

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The functions are internal (not in __all__)
   - No documentation claims these should round-trip for all float values
   - Using float32 format ('f') inherently has precision limitations
   - The behavior is correct for float32 encoding

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug accurately describes what happens
   - Data loss is a real issue
   - Users would reasonably expect round-trip to work

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Values like 4.484782e-144 are extreme edge cases
   - Such tiny values are essentially zero for most practical purposes
   - This is denormalized float territory, often treated as zero
   - For embedding vectors (mentioned use case), such tiny values are meaningless

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Silent data corruption is never trivial
   - The fix is simple (use 'd' for float64)
   - Some scientific applications might need such precision

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Supporting float64 precision would be a new feature
   - The current implementation works as designed (float32)
   - Adding validation for out-of-range values would be new functionality

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is about fixing existing broken behavior, not adding new features
   - Round-trip property is a reasonable expectation for encode/decode

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The main issue is lack of documentation about float32 limitations
   - Functions have no docstrings explaining their behavior
   - Adding documentation would clarify expectations
   - The code works correctly for float32, just needs documentation

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The actual code behavior is problematic, not just the docs
   - Documentation alone won't prevent data loss

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This is most likely a WONTFIX case. Here's why:

1. The functions are internal (not in __all__), suggesting they're not meant for public use
2. The values that fail (like 4.484782e-144) are extreme denormalized values that are essentially zero
3. For the stated use case (embedding vectors), such tiny values are meaningless noise
4. Float32 precision is a reasonable choice for embeddings to save space
5. The "bug" is really just the natural behavior of float32 encoding

Secondary possibility: DOCUMENTATION_FIX if these functions are meant to be used internally, as the limitation should be documented.

Least likely: BUG - because the functions work correctly for float32, which is what they implement.
