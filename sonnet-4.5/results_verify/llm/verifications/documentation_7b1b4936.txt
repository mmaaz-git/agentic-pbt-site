## Documentation Analysis for validate_logit_bias

### Source Code Context
The function is part of Simon Willison's LLM library (https://github.com/simonw/llm), specifically in the OpenAI models plugin. This is a widely-used CLI tool and Python library for interacting with various LLMs including OpenAI.

### OpenAI API Documentation
According to OpenAI's official documentation and community resources:
- The `logit_bias` parameter accepts values from **-100 to 100**
- -100: blocks/bans a token from being generated
- 100: makes exclusive selection of that token
- Values between -1 and 1: moderate probability adjustments
- The parameter maps token IDs (integers) to bias values

### Function Implementation Review
Looking at the actual implementation in the source code:
1. The function accepts None, a JSON string, or a dictionary
2. It validates that keys can be converted to integers
3. It validates that values are integers between -100 and 100
4. It raises ValueError for invalid inputs

### Documentation Findings
**No explicit documentation found that specifies:**
- What specific error messages MUST be returned
- Whether different error types should be distinguished (e.g., type conversion errors vs range errors)
- Whether the function should preserve specific error messages for debugging

**What the documentation implies:**
- The function should validate inputs according to OpenAI's constraints (-100 to 100)
- Invalid inputs should raise errors
- The function serves as a validator before passing data to OpenAI's API

### Key Observation
The documentation does not explicitly state that:
1. Specific error messages must be preserved for different error types
2. Range validation errors must be distinguishable from type conversion errors
3. The error message "Value must be between -100 and 100" must be shown to users

The current implementation catches ALL ValueErrors and replaces them with a generic message. While this loses specificity, there is no documentation that explicitly requires preserving the specific error messages for debugging purposes.

### Conclusion
The documentation focuses on the valid range (-100 to 100) and the expected input types, but does not mandate specific error message handling or require that different error conditions produce distinguishable error messages. This is a quality-of-implementation issue rather than a violation of documented behavior.
