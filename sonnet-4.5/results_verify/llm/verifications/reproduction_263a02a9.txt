REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

Bug Report Claim:
The bug report claims that llm.decode() silently truncates input data when the binary length is not a multiple of 4 bytes, potentially hiding data corruption without warning.

Reproduction Steps Performed:
1. Ran the exact code from the bug report's reproduction section
2. Tested the property-based test with Hypothesis
3. Tested struct.unpack behavior directly
4. Tested multiple scenarios with different byte lengths

Actual Behavior Observed:
When llm.decode() is called with binary data that is NOT a multiple of 4 bytes, it does NOT silently truncate. Instead:
- Python's struct.unpack() raises a struct.error exception
- The error message states: "unpack requires a buffer of X bytes"
- This happens consistently for all tested cases (13, 14, 15 bytes, etc.)

Test Results:
- Input: 13 bytes (12 bytes valid + 1 extra byte)
  Result: struct.error: "unpack requires a buffer of 12 bytes"

- Property-based test with Hypothesis:
  Result: Test passes - decode() correctly raises exceptions for invalid inputs

- Direct struct.unpack testing:
  Result: struct.unpack requires exact buffer size match in Python 3.13.2

Key Finding:
The bug report is INCORRECT about the current behavior. The decode() function does NOT silently truncate data. It raises an appropriate exception when given invalid input (binary data not divisible by 4).

Python Version Tested: 3.13.2

The bug report's claim of "silent data truncation" is false. The current implementation correctly validates input length by relying on struct.unpack's strict buffer size requirements.
