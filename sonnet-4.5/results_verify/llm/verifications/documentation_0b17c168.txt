## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `combine_chunks` function has no inline documentation or docstring. Its purpose must be inferred from its implementation and usage context. The function is defined at line 919 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py`.

### Package Information
- Package: llm v0.27.1
- Author: Simon Willison
- Repository: https://github.com/simonw/llm
- Description: CLI utility and Python library for interacting with Large Language Models including OpenAI

### Usage Context
The function is used in three places in the codebase:
1. Line 832: In AsyncChat class for streaming responses
2. Two other locations for similar streaming chunk combination

### OpenAI Streaming API Specification
Based on OpenAI's streaming API documentation and behavior:

1. **First Chunk**: Contains the role field (e.g., "assistant") along with empty content:
   ```json
   {"delta": {"content": "", "role": "assistant"}}
   ```

2. **Subsequent Chunks**: Contain only content deltas, with role field absent or None:
   ```json
   {"delta": {"content": "text fragment"}}
   ```

3. **Final Chunk**: Has empty delta and finish_reason="stop":
   ```json
   {"delta": {}, "finish_reason": "stop"}
   ```

### Expected Behavior
The combine_chunks function should:
1. Preserve the role from the first chunk where it's provided
2. Concatenate content from all chunks
3. Preserve the finish_reason from the last chunk
4. Handle usage statistics and logprobs if present

### Actual Behavior
The current implementation unconditionally overwrites the role field on each iteration (line 943), causing it to be set to None when processing subsequent chunks that don't have a role field.

### Documentation Verdict
While there is no explicit documentation for the combine_chunks function itself, the OpenAI streaming API behavior is well-documented and establishes clear expectations:
- The role should be preserved from the first chunk
- Subsequent chunks should not overwrite the role with None
- The function name "combine_chunks" clearly implies it should combine/merge chunks properly

The lack of explicit documentation for this internal function doesn't make this bug invalid - the function's purpose is clear from its name and usage, and it fails to correctly implement the expected streaming chunk combination behavior as specified by the OpenAI API it's designed to work with.
