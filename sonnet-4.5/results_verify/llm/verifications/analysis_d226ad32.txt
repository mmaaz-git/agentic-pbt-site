## Triage Analysis for not_nulls Bug Report

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function has a misleading type signature `-> dict` suggesting it accepts dict-like inputs
2. The function name "not_nulls" is generic and doesn't indicate Pydantic-specific behavior
3. The implementation contradicts the principle of least surprise
4. The function fails on valid Python dictionaries with a cryptic error message
5. The bug is easily reproducible with simple test cases
6. The fix is straightforward and would make the function work for both cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function currently works correctly for its actual use case in the codebase
2. It's an internal utility function, not part of the public API

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function might have been intentionally designed for Pydantic models only
2. It's working as intended for its current usage

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Nothing in the code indicates this is intentional
2. The type signature is misleading if this were intentional
3. The function name doesn't suggest Pydantic-specific behavior
4. No documentation states this limitation

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. It's an internal function that works for its current use case
2. Nobody has reported issues with it in production
3. Changing it might be considered unnecessary churn

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The fix is trivial (adding `.items()`)
2. The current implementation is objectively incorrect for the implied contract
3. This could cause future bugs if someone tries to reuse this function

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function works correctly for its current use case
2. Could document that it's Pydantic-specific

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code itself is wrong, not just the documentation
2. The type hint is part of the code, not documentation
3. Fixing the code is simpler than documenting the limitation

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Supporting regular dicts could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature
2. The function signature already implies dict support
3. The current implementation is broken for a basic use case

### Summary
This is a clear BUG because:
1. The function has a generic name and type signature that implies dict support
2. It fails on valid Python dictionaries with an error
3. The implementation uses incorrect iteration syntax for dicts
4. The fix is trivial and makes the function work correctly for all cases
5. There's no documentation or indication that the current behavior is intentional
