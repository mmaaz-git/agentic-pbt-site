# Documentation Analysis for truncate_string

## Available Documentation

### 1. Function Docstring
The function has a docstring that states:
```
Truncate a string to a maximum length, with options to normalize whitespace and keep both start and end.

Args:
    text: The string to truncate
    max_length: Maximum length of the result string
    normalize_whitespace: If True, replace all whitespace with a single space
    keep_end: If True, keep both beginning and end of string

Returns:
    Truncated string
```

### 2. External Documentation
- No documentation found in the official llm package documentation at llm.datasette.io
- The function appears to be an internal utility function not documented in the public API
- No README or other documentation files found that describe this function
- No usage examples found within the codebase

## Key Documentation Points

### What the Documentation States:
1. The function will "Truncate a string to a maximum length"
2. The `max_length` parameter is described as "Maximum length of the result string"
3. The return value is described as "Truncated string"

### What the Documentation Implies:
The documentation clearly implies that the returned string should have a length that does not exceed `max_length`. The parameter is explicitly named `max_length` and described as "Maximum length of the result string", which creates a strong expectation that:
- `len(truncate_string(text, max_length)) <= max_length`

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify:
1. No explicit mention of what happens when `max_length` is very small (e.g., 1 or 2)
2. No mention of minimum valid values for `max_length`
3. No explicit statement that ellipsis ("...") will be added
4. No specification of behavior when the ellipsis itself would exceed `max_length`

## Analysis

The documentation establishes a clear contract: the function should truncate a string to a maximum length. The parameter name `max_length` and its description "Maximum length of the result string" create an unambiguous expectation that this is an upper bound on the result's length.

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state the invariant `len(result) <= max_length`, this invariant is strongly implied by:
1. The function name "truncate_string"
2. The parameter name "max_length" (not "target_length" or "approximate_length")
3. The description "Maximum length of the result string"

The fact that the function adds ellipsis ("...") is an implementation detail not mentioned in the documentation, but even with this detail, the function should respect the maximum length constraint.

## Conclusion

The documentation, while brief, clearly establishes that the function should respect the `max_length` parameter as an upper bound. The current implementation's failure to enforce this for small values of `max_length` violates the documented behavior.
