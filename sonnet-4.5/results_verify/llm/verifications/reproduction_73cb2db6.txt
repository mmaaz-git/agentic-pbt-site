## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Code Examination

I have successfully reproduced the bug by examining the source code at:
`/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py`

### AsyncChat.execute Method (lines 798-803)

The async version contains duplicate code:
```python
async for chunk in completion:
    if chunk.usage:                    # Line 799-800: First check
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
    chunks.append(chunk)                # Line 801: Append chunk
    if chunk.usage:                    # Line 802-803: Second identical check (REDUNDANT)
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
```

### Chat.execute Method (lines 713-716)

The synchronous version has the correct implementation:
```python
for chunk in completion:
    chunks.append(chunk)                # Line 714: Append chunk first
    if chunk.usage:                    # Line 715-716: Single check
        usage = chunk.usage.model_dump()
```

### Effect of the Bug

1. **Functional Impact**: The bug is functionally harmless. The code still works correctly because:
   - The second check and assignment is identical to the first
   - The `usage` variable gets the same value assigned twice
   - No data corruption or incorrect behavior occurs

2. **Performance Impact**: Minimal but unnecessary:
   - Double evaluation of `chunk.usage` condition
   - Double call to `chunk.usage.model_dump()` when usage data exists
   - Slightly increased CPU usage in the async streaming loop

3. **Code Quality Impact**:
   - Clear code duplication that violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - Inconsistency between async and sync implementations without justification
   - Appears to be an obvious copy-paste error during development

### Verification

The bug report is accurate:
- The line numbers (799-803) are correct
- The duplicate code exists as described
- The sync version (lines 713-716) differs and is correctly implemented
- The suggested fix aligns the async version with the sync version

The bug is real and reproducible through code inspection.
