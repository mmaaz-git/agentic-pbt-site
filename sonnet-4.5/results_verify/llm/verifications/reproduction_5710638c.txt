REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

Bug Report Claim: The not_nulls function in openai_models.py is incompatible with Pydantic v2's BaseModel iteration behavior, causing a ValueError when attempting to filter None values from model options.

Testing Environment:
- Python 3.13
- Pydantic version: 2.10.3
- Module: llm.default_plugins.openai_models

Reproduction Attempts:
----------------------

1. Property-Based Test:
   - The provided Hypothesis test FAILED to demonstrate the bug
   - When running the test, it did NOT raise ValueError as claimed
   - The not_nulls function worked correctly with Pydantic models

2. Direct Reproduction:
   - Created Options(max_tokens=50) as specified in bug report
   - Called not_nulls(options)
   - Result: SUCCESS - returned {'max_tokens': 50}
   - NO ValueError was raised

3. Iteration Behavior Analysis:
   - Tested direct iteration over Pydantic BaseModel instance
   - Result: Yields tuples of (field_name, value), NOT strings as claimed
   - Example: iterating Options(temperature=0.5) yields ('temperature', 0.5)

4. Actual Function Test:
   - Located the actual not_nulls function at line 915 of openai_models.py
   - Function definition: {key: value for key, value in data if value is not None}
   - This works correctly because Pydantic v2 yields tuples, not strings

CONCLUSION:
-----------
The bug report is INCORRECT. The claimed incompatibility does not exist.

In Pydantic v2.10.3:
- Iterating over a BaseModel yields (key, value) tuples
- The not_nulls function works correctly with these tuples
- No ValueError occurs when unpacking the iteration items

The bug reporter incorrectly stated that "In Pydantic v2, iterating over a BaseModel instance yields field names (strings), not (key, value) tuples." This is factually wrong - Pydantic v2 does yield tuples, making the not_nulls function compatible.
