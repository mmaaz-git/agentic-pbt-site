## Reproduction Report for validate_logit_bias Exception Handling Bug

### Test Setup
I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report by running both the Hypothesis-based property test and manual reproduction cases.

### Key Findings

1. **Bug Confirmed**: The bug exists exactly as described. When `validate_logit_bias` receives a value outside the valid range [-100, 100], it:
   - First raises `ValueError("Value must be between -100 and 100")` on line 427
   - This exception is immediately caught by the `except ValueError` on line 428
   - The original specific error is replaced with the generic `ValueError("Invalid key-value pair in logit_bias dictionary")`

2. **Test Results**:
   - When passing `{"100": 150}` (value 150 is > 100), the error message is "Invalid key-value pair in logit_bias dictionary" instead of the more specific "Value must be between -100 and 100"
   - Same behavior for negative out-of-range values like `{"100": -150}`
   - Valid values like `{"100": 50}` work correctly, returning `{100: 50}`
   - Invalid keys (non-numeric) also produce the same generic error
   - Invalid value types (non-numeric) also produce the same generic error

3. **Impact**: Users cannot distinguish between:
   - A key that cannot be converted to integer
   - A value that cannot be converted to integer
   - A value that is out of the valid range [-100, 100]

   This makes debugging difficult as all three different error conditions produce the same generic error message.

4. **Root Cause**: The code structure has a flaw where:
   - Lines 422-427 attempt to convert and validate the values
   - Line 427 raises a specific ValueError for out-of-range values
   - Line 428 catches ALL ValueErrors (including the one just raised on line 427) and replaces them with a generic message

   This is a clear logic error in the exception handling flow.

### Hypothesis Test Validation
The Hypothesis test successfully generates numerous test cases with out-of-range values and confirms that all of them produce the generic "Invalid key-value pair in logit_bias dictionary" error rather than the specific "Value must be between -100 and 100" message.

### Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. The exception handling in `validate_logit_bias` inappropriately catches and masks the specific error message about value range violations, replacing it with a generic error that provides insufficient information for debugging.
