## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the issue. The bug is confirmed and behaves exactly as described.

### Test Results:

1. **Simple Reproduction Test**:
   - Input: `{"a": [1, None, 3], "b": {"c": [None, 2]}}`
   - Output: `{"a": [1, None, 3], "b": {"c": [None, 2]}}`
   - Result: None values remain in both lists, confirming the bug

2. **Failing Input from Report**:
   - Input: `{"a": [1, None, 3]}`
   - Output: `{"a": [1, None, 3]}`
   - Result: None value remains in the list

3. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The test correctly fails with the assertion error: "Result still contains None: {'a': [1, None, 3]}"

### Effect of the Bug:

The function `remove_dict_none_values` does NOT remove None values from lists, only from dictionary values. This means:

1. When a dictionary contains a list with None values, those None values are preserved in the output
2. This applies to both top-level lists and nested lists within subdictionaries
3. The function's behavior is inconsistent - it removes None values that are direct dictionary values, but preserves None values within lists

### Root Cause Verification:

As stated in the bug report, the issue is on line 92 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/utils.py`:
```python
new_dict[key] = [remove_dict_none_values(v) for v in value]
```

This line recursively calls `remove_dict_none_values` on each list element, but since the function returns `d` unchanged when `d` is not a dict (line 83), None values are returned as-is and included in the new list.
