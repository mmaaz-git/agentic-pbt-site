Bug Reproduction Analysis

1. Bug Report Claims:
The bug report claims that not_nulls() expects an iterable of (key, value) tuples but is called with prompt.options which can be a dict, causing a ValueError.

2. Reproduction Results:

Test 1 - Direct call with dict:
- Input: {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": None, "top_p": 0.9}
- Result: ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2) [single-key dict]
- Result: ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1) [multi-key dict]
- CONFIRMED: The function crashes when given a non-empty dict

Test 2 - Direct call with dict.items():
- Input: dict.items()
- Result: {'temperature': 0.7, 'top_p': 0.9} (correctly filtered out None)
- CONFIRMED: The function works correctly with dict.items()

Test 3 - Empty dict:
- Input: {}
- Result: {} (no error)
- Note: Empty dict doesn't crash because no iteration occurs

3. Root Cause Analysis:
The not_nulls function uses this comprehension:
```python
{key: value for key, value in data if value is not None}
```

When `data` is a dict:
- Iterating yields keys only (strings like "temperature", "max_tokens")
- The comprehension tries to unpack each key into (key, value)
- Single character keys fail with "too many values to unpack"
- Multi-character keys fail with "not enough values to unpack"

When `data` is dict.items() or a BaseModel:
- Iterating yields (key, value) tuples
- The comprehension works correctly

4. Real-World Impact:
The bug occurs at line 658 where not_nulls(prompt.options) is called.
- If prompt.options is an empty dict: No error (common case)
- If prompt.options is a non-empty dict: ValueError crash
- If prompt.options is a BaseModel instance: Works correctly

5. Technical Details Match:
The bug report's technical analysis is CORRECT:
- The error messages match exactly
- The line numbers are accurate
- The explanation of Python's dict iteration behavior is correct
- The suggested fixes would resolve the issue
