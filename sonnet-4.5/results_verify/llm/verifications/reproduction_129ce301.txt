## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in llm.cosine_similarity function.

### Location of Function
The function is located in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/__init__.py` at approximately line 458.

### Current Implementation
```python
def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    dot_product = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    magnitude_a = sum(x * x for x in a) ** 0.5
    magnitude_b = sum(x * x for x in b) ** 0.5
    return dot_product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
```

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The provided hypothesis test fails as expected
   - Falsifying example found: `a=[0.0], b=[0.0]`
   - The test correctly identifies that the function raises ZeroDivisionError instead of handling zero vectors gracefully

2. **Direct Reproduction**:
   - Test case 1: `a = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`, `b = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`
     - Result: `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`
   - Test case 2: `a = [0.0, 0.0]`, `b = [0.0, 0.0]`
     - Result: `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`

### The Bug is Confirmed
The function crashes with a ZeroDivisionError when either or both input vectors have zero magnitude (all elements are zero). This occurs because:
- When a vector consists of all zeros, its magnitude is 0.0
- The function attempts to divide by (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
- When either magnitude is zero, this results in division by zero

The bug report accurately describes the issue and the reproduction steps are correct.
