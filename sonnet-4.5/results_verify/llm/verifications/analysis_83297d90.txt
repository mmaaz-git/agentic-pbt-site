TRIAGE ANALYSIS FOR llm.cosine_similarity BUG REPORT
====================================================

CONSIDERATION FOR EACH CATEGORY:

1. BUG
------
Arguments FOR:
- The function crashes with an unhelpful ZeroDivisionError on valid mathematical inputs
- Zero vectors are legitimate vector inputs, not garbage data
- The error message gives no guidance on what went wrong
- Most modern implementations handle this case gracefully
- This is a utility function that users would reasonably expect to be robust
- The fix is trivial and improves user experience

Arguments AGAINST:
- No documentation claims it handles zero vectors
- The mathematical operation is technically undefined for zero vectors
- The function correctly implements the mathematical formula as-is

2. INVALID
----------
Arguments FOR:
- There's no documentation specifying behavior for zero vectors
- The function never promised to handle edge cases
- Mathematically, cosine similarity IS undefined for zero vectors
- The error accurately reflects what happened (division by zero)

Arguments AGAINST:
- Zero vectors are valid inputs that occur in real-world scenarios
- The error is not descriptive enough for users to understand the issue
- Mathematical functions typically handle edge cases gracefully
- The bug report correctly identifies a robustness issue

3. WONTFIX
----------
Arguments FOR:
- Could be considered an obscure edge case if zero vectors are rare in practice
- The current error technically tells you what's wrong

Arguments AGAINST:
- Zero vectors are common in embedding/similarity calculations (e.g., missing data, initialization)
- The fix is trivial (3-4 lines of code)
- This significantly impacts user experience

4. FEATURE_REQUEST
------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Adding zero vector handling could be seen as a new feature
- The function currently implements just the basic formula
- Enhanced error handling is often considered a feature

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- Robust input handling is expected behavior, not a feature
- The function already exists and should work for all valid vector inputs

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
--------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The function lacks any documentation whatsoever
- Adding documentation about zero vector behavior would clarify expectations
- Could document that zero vectors will cause errors

Arguments AGAINST:
- The actual code behavior is problematic, not just the documentation
- Users shouldn't need documentation to avoid crashes
- Even with documentation, the poor error message remains unhelpful

FINAL ANALYSIS:
--------------
This is clearly a BUG because:

1. CRASHES ON VALID INPUT: Zero vectors are mathematically valid vectors, even if cosine similarity is undefined for them. A robust function should handle this gracefully.

2. POOR ERROR MESSAGE: Even if we accept that an error should be raised, ZeroDivisionError is unhelpful. It doesn't tell users that the issue is a zero vector.

3. COMMON SCENARIO: Zero vectors commonly occur in:
   - Sparse data representations
   - Initialization states
   - Missing/null embeddings
   - User-generated content

4. TRIVIAL FIX: The fix requires minimal code changes and has no negative impact on performance or existing functionality.

5. INDUSTRY STANDARD: Most modern implementations of cosine similarity handle zero vectors by:
   - Returning NaN (mathematically correct)
   - Returning 0.0 (pragmatic choice)
   - Raising ValueError with clear message

6. USER EXPERIENCE: A utility function in a widely-used library should not crash with cryptic errors on edge cases.

While the lack of documentation means there's no explicit contract being violated, the principle of least surprise and basic robustness expectations make this a legitimate bug rather than a feature request or documentation issue.
