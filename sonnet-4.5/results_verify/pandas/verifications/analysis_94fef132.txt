## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function crashes with an unclear error deep in the stack rather than handling the error gracefully
2. Surrogate characters are valid in Python strings and can legitimately appear in DataFrames
3. JSON specification allows surrogates when properly escaped (e.g., \uD800)
4. pandas.to_csv() already has an 'errors' parameter to handle this exact scenario (PR #32702)
5. The crash is unrecoverable - there's no workaround using existing parameters
6. The error message doesn't clearly indicate the problem or solution
7. This is a data loss scenario - users cannot export their data to JSON if it contains surrogates

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None significant

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Surrogates are technically invalid UTF-8, so one could argue the crash is expected

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Python strings support surrogates, so pandas should handle Python data
2. The same issue was considered valid for to_csv() and fixed
3. JSON can represent surrogates through escape sequences
4. No documentation states this limitation
5. The error occurs in internal processing, not at the API boundary

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Surrogate characters are relatively rare in practice
- Could be considered an edge case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Not that rare - they appear in emoji, corrupted data, or data from certain sources
2. pandas already fixed this for to_csv(), showing it's worth fixing
3. The fix is straightforward (add errors parameter like to_csv())
4. Silent data loss or crashes are serious issues for a data processing library

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Adding an 'errors' parameter would be a new feature
2. Current behavior could be considered "working as designed"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
2. to_csv() treating this as a bug (not feature) sets precedent
3. Basic error handling is expected functionality, not a feature

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- If the crash is intended, the documentation should warn about it

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code behavior (crashing) is clearly wrong
2. Documenting a limitation doesn't fix the underlying issue
3. pandas already established the pattern of handling this in code (to_csv())

### Precedent Analysis
The most relevant precedent is GitHub Issue #22610 where the identical problem with to_csv() was:
1. Accepted as a valid issue
2. Fixed by adding an 'errors' parameter
3. Not dismissed as invalid or wontfix
4. Implemented to "satisfy the principle of least surprise"

### Consistency Argument
pandas should be internally consistent. If to_csv() handles encoding errors gracefully with an 'errors' parameter, to_json() should too. Having different error handling behavior for similar I/O operations is confusing and problematic.

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function should handle surrogate characters gracefully rather than crashing, especially since:
1. The same issue was fixed for to_csv()
2. JSON can represent these characters
3. There's no way to work around the issue with current parameters
4. The crash prevents legitimate data export
