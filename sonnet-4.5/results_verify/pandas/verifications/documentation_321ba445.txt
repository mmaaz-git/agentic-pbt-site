## Documentation Analysis

### Function Docstrings
The docstrings for the two functions clearly state their purpose:

**is_subperiod**: "Returns True if downsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"
**is_superperiod**: "Returns True if upsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"

Both functions have identical parameter descriptions:
- source: Frequency converting from
- target: Frequency converting to

### Frequency Meanings
From pandas documentation and testing:
- **'D' (Day)**: Calendar day frequency - includes all days (Mon-Sun)
- **'B' (Business Day)**: Business day frequency - weekdays only (Mon-Fri), excludes weekends
- **'C' (Custom Business Day)**: Custom business day frequency - similar to B but can be customized with holidays

### Mathematical Relationship
The documentation does not explicitly state that is_subperiod and is_superperiod should be inverse operations. However, the logical interpretation of "downsampling" and "upsampling" strongly implies this relationship:

1. **Downsampling** (is_subperiod): Converting from a higher frequency to a lower frequency (e.g., from daily to weekly)
2. **Upsampling** (is_superperiod): Converting from a lower frequency to a higher frequency (e.g., from weekly to daily)

If you can downsample from frequency A to frequency B, it means A has more granular data points than B. Conversely, if you can upsample from B to A, it means B has less granular data points than A. These are describing the same relationship from opposite directions.

### Logical Relationship Between D, B, and C
Conceptually:
- Business days (B) are a subset of calendar days (D) - only weekdays
- Custom business days (C) are also a subset of calendar days (D) - weekdays minus holidays
- It is reasonable to convert between these frequencies:
  - D → B: Filter daily data to only weekdays (downsampling by selection)
  - B → D: Fill in weekend gaps in business day data (upsampling)
  - Similar logic applies for D ↔ C and B ↔ C

### Conclusion
While the documentation doesn't explicitly require the inverse relationship, the semantic meaning of "downsampling" and "upsampling" as inverse operations, combined with the mathematical nature of frequency conversions, strongly suggests this should be true. The current implementation violates this expected behavior.
