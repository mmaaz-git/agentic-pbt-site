TRIAGE ANALYSIS

Evaluating the bug report against five possible categories:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- Silent data corruption is a critical issue - returning 0 for -2^64 is objectively wrong
- The behavior is inconsistent: some values raise errors, others silently corrupt
- Valid JSON is being incorrectly parsed (stdlib json handles it correctly)
- Data integrity violations are serious bugs in any data processing library
- The serialized JSON is valid according to RFC 7159
- No documentation warns users about this silent corruption behavior

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- ujson is known to have integer limits for performance reasons
- Some might argue this is expected behavior for a C-based fast JSON parser

2. INVALID (Incorrect report):
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- ujson has known limitations with large integers that users should be aware of

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- The bug is real and reproducible - the report is factually correct
- Silent data corruption is never acceptable, even if there are known limits
- The inconsistent behavior (sometimes error, sometimes corruption) makes this not just a limitation

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- Values at exactly -2^64 might be considered edge cases
- ujson prioritizes speed over correctness for extreme values

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- Silent data corruption is NEVER trivial
- Financial, scientific, and cryptographic applications use large integers
- The security implications mentioned in the report are valid
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a power of 2 boundary

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported):
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- Supporting arbitrary precision integers could be seen as a new feature
- ujson was designed with C-style integer limits

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- This isn't requesting new functionality - it's fixing broken behavior
- The function already attempts to handle these values (it serializes them)
- Failing safely is not a feature, it's a requirement

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue):
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- If ujson documented this limitation clearly, users could avoid it
- The documentation could warn about silent corruption at -2^64

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- Documentation cannot fix silent data corruption
- Even with documentation, the inconsistent behavior is problematic
- The function should either work correctly or fail clearly

CRITICAL ANALYSIS:
The key issue is SILENT DATA CORRUPTION. This is fundamentally different from:
- Raising an error (acceptable for unsupported values)
- Having documented limitations (acceptable if consistent)
- Performance trade-offs (acceptable with clear boundaries)

Silent corruption means:
- Users cannot detect the problem programmatically
- Data integrity is compromised without warning
- Testing may not catch these edge cases
- Production systems could have corrupted data

CONCLUSION:
This is a BUG. While ujson may have acceptable limitations for performance, silently returning incorrect values crosses the line from "limitation" to "bug". The correct behavior would be to either:
1. Handle the value correctly (like stdlib json), or
2. Raise an error consistently (like it does for -2^63 - 1)

Returning 0 for -2^64 is indefensible behavior that could cause serious data corruption in production systems.
