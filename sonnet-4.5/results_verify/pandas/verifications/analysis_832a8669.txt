TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating this bug report against each possible category:

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
----------------------
Arguments FOR:
1. The function clearly violates its documented behavior - it should return a boolean, not raise exceptions
2. The function's name "is_re_compilable" is a predicate that semantically promises a True/False answer
3. The documentation explicitly states the function helps "prevent runtime errors" - yet it causes them
4. The example shows non-compilable inputs (like integer 1) return False, establishing the pattern
5. Invalid regex patterns are indeed "not compilable", so should return False
6. The fix is trivial and obvious - catch re.error in addition to TypeError
7. This is a clear violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle - users expect consistent boolean returns

Arguments AGAINST:
- None. This is clearly a bug.

INVALID
-------
Arguments FOR:
- None. The documentation clearly establishes the expected behavior.

Arguments AGAINST:
1. The documentation explicitly promises boolean returns
2. The function's purpose is to safely check compilability
3. The examples show False should be returned for non-compilable inputs

WONTFIX
-------
Arguments FOR:
- None. This is not an obscure edge case - invalid regex patterns are common.

Arguments AGAINST:
1. This affects common use cases (invalid user input validation)
2. The bug defeats the entire purpose of the function (safe validation)
3. The fix is trivial and has no downsides

FEATURE_REQUEST
---------------
Arguments FOR:
- None. The documentation already promises this behavior.

Arguments AGAINST:
1. This is not adding new functionality - it's fixing broken existing functionality
2. The documentation already describes the expected behavior that's not working

DOCUMENTATION_FIX
-----------------
Arguments FOR:
- One could argue the documentation could be updated to say "raises re.PatternError for invalid patterns"

Arguments AGAINST:
1. Changing docs to match current behavior would defeat the function's entire purpose
2. The function name itself implies it should return bool for the "is_" predicate
3. The documented purpose is to "prevent runtime errors" - documenting that it causes them is absurd
4. Other pandas is_* functions (is_integer, is_float, etc.) all return bool consistently

FINAL ASSESSMENT
----------------
This is unequivocally a BUG. The function fails to fulfill its documented contract of returning
a boolean value indicating whether an object can be compiled as a regex. Instead, it crashes with
re.PatternError for invalid regex patterns, defeating its stated purpose of helping prevent runtime
errors. The fix is straightforward - catch re.error exceptions in addition to TypeError.
