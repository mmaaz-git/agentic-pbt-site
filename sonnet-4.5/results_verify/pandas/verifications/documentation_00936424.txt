## Documentation Findings for pandas.util.capitalize_first_letter

### Function Location and Implementation
The function `capitalize_first_letter` is located in `/pandas/util/__init__.py` and has a very simple implementation:
```python
def capitalize_first_letter(s):
    return s[:1].upper() + s[1:]
```

### Documentation Status
1. **No public documentation exists**: The function has no docstring and is not documented in the official pandas API reference.
2. **Module is PRIVATE**: According to the pandas documentation, `pandas.util` is explicitly marked as a PRIVATE module. The pandas documentation states: "The pandas.core, pandas.compat, and pandas.util top-level modules are PRIVATE. Stable functionality in such modules is not guaranteed."
3. **No specified behavior**: There is no documentation about how this function should handle Unicode characters, edge cases, or what the expected behavior is.

### Function Usage
The function is only used internally in one place within pandas:
- In `/pandas/core/dtypes/dtypes.py`, line 1090, within the `PeriodDtype.__eq__` method
- Used for dtype name comparison: `return other in [self.name, capitalize_first_letter(self.name)]`
- This usage is for comparing period dtype names with potential capitalization variations (e.g., "period[D]" vs "Period[D]")

### Key Observations
1. The function has no documentation or specification about preserving string length
2. The function does not document any Unicode handling behavior
3. The function is in a PRIVATE module not intended for public use
4. There are no unit tests or property tests that specify the expected behavior
5. The actual implementation uses Python's standard `.upper()` method, which follows Unicode case mapping rules

### Conclusion on Documentation
Since there is no documentation that specifies the function should preserve string length, and since the module is explicitly private with no stability guarantees, any assumptions about the function's behavior (including length preservation) are not based on documented contracts.
