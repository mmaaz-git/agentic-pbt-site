## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report. The inconsistency is real and observable.

### Test Results

1. **Empty string behavior** (`eval("")`):
   - Result: Raises `ValueError: expr cannot be an empty string`
   - This is the expected and documented behavior

2. **Whitespace-only string behavior**:
   - `eval(" ")` → Returns `None`
   - `eval("   ")` → Returns `None`
   - `eval("\t")` → Returns `None`
   - `eval("\n")` → Returns `None`
   - `eval("\r\n")` → Returns `None`
   - `eval("  \n  ")` → Returns `None`

3. **Valid expressions with whitespace**:
   - `eval(" 1 + 1 ")` → Returns `2` (correctly evaluates)
   - This shows the function can handle leading/trailing whitespace when there's a valid expression

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs because of the implementation in `_check_expression`:

```python
def _check_expression(expr):
    if not expr:  # This only catches empty string, not whitespace
        raise ValueError("expr cannot be an empty string")
```

The condition `not expr` evaluates to:
- `True` for `""` (empty string) - so it raises the error
- `False` for `" "` or any whitespace string (truthy in Python) - so it passes through

After passing this check, the whitespace-only string goes through:
1. Line 307: `exprs = [e.strip() for e in expr.splitlines() if e.strip() != ""]`
   - This results in an empty list `[]` for whitespace-only input
2. Since `exprs` is empty, the loop on line 326 (`for expr in exprs:`) doesn't execute
3. The function returns the initial value of `ret = None` (line 322)

### Behavioral Inconsistency

The inconsistency is clear:
- **Empty string (`""`)**: Raises ValueError as intended
- **Whitespace strings (`" "`, `"\n"`, etc.)**: Silently return None

Both types of input are semantically empty (contain no evaluatable expression), yet they're handled differently. The error message "expr cannot be an empty string" suggests the intent is to reject expressions with no content, not just zero-length strings.

### Property Test Validation

The Hypothesis test from the bug report is valid. It expects all strings where `s.strip()` is empty to raise ValueError, which is a reasonable expectation for consistency. The test correctly identifies that whitespace-only strings don't raise the expected error.
