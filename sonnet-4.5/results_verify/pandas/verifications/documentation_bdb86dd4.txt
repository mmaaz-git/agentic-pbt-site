## Documentation Analysis

### Official pandas Documentation
1. **IntegerArray Documentation**: The pandas.arrays.IntegerArray documentation does not specifically mention power operations or how negative exponents are handled. It states that IntegerArray is "currently experimental" and its API may change.

2. **Power Operation Documentation**: Neither pandas.Series.pow nor pandas.DataFrame.pow documentation specifically addresses the behavior of integer arrays with negative exponents.

3. **Nullable Integer Documentation**: The nullable integer data type documentation mentions that operations behave similar to NumPy arrays but doesn't detail edge cases like 1**(-1).

### NumPy Documentation Reference
The numpy.power documentation explicitly states: "An integer type raised to a negative integer power will raise a ValueError."

This is the underlying behavior that pandas inherits when using integer arrays.

### Expected vs. Documented Behavior
1. **No explicit documentation** exists in pandas stating that 1**(-1) with IntegerArray should raise an error
2. **No explicit documentation** exists stating that 1**x should always equal 1 for IntegerArray
3. The behavior follows NumPy's documented constraint, but pandas has its own special case code that attempts to handle 1**x = 1

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not:
- Explain that IntegerArray power operations follow NumPy's integer power restrictions
- Document the special case optimization for 1**x = 1 that exists in the code
- Clarify whether mathematical correctness (1**(-1) = 1) should override type restrictions

### Conclusion
The documentation is insufficient to determine whether this is expected behavior or a bug. The code clearly attempts to handle 1**x as a special case (evidenced by line 811 in masked.py), suggesting the developers intended for this to work. The fact that the special case code exists but is unreachable due to order of operations strongly suggests this is an implementation bug rather than intended behavior.
