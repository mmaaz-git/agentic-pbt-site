Bug Reproduction Results for pandas.io.sas.sas_xport._split_line
=================================================================

Test Environment:
- Python version: 3.13
- pandas location: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/

Test Results:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION TEST (without '_' field):
   Input: parts = [("name", 10), ("value", 10)]
          test_string = "hello     world     "
   Result: KeyError: '_' was raised
   Status: BUG CONFIRMED - The function crashes with KeyError when '_' is not in parts

2. NORMAL USAGE TEST (with '_' field):
   Input: parts = [("name", 10), ("_", 5), ("value", 5)]
          test_string = "hello     xxx  world"
   Result: {'name': 'hello', 'value': 'world'}
   Status: Works correctly - '_' field was filtered out as documented

3. PROPERTY-BASED TEST:
   The hypothesis test that excludes '_' from parts list consistently triggers KeyError
   Status: BUG CONFIRMED - Any parts list without '_' causes failure

Technical Details of the Bug:

The implementation at line 174 contains:
```python
del out["_"]
```

This is an unconditional deletion that assumes '_' will always be present in the output dictionary. If no field named '_' was included in the parts parameter, the dictionary won't have this key, causing a KeyError.

Bug Behavior Verification:
- The bug report's claim is ACCURATE
- The reproduction code provided in the bug report works exactly as described
- The KeyError occurs on line 174 when attempting to delete the '_' key
- All current internal callers work because they always include '_' in their parts lists

Impact Assessment:
- This is a private function (starts with underscore)
- All current internal uses include '_' fields, so production code is not affected
- External code or future refactoring could trigger this issue
- The error message (KeyError: '_') is cryptic and doesn't help users understand the requirement

The bug report's suggested fixes are both technically valid:
1. Using `out.pop("_", None)` would silently handle missing '_' fields
2. Documenting the requirement would clarify the API contract
