## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considerations for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The docstring states "Return the expected length of target[indexer]". The expected length should match `len(target[indexer])`, which is never negative.

2. **Mathematical Incorrectness**: Length is a non-negative measure by definition. Returning -1, -40, -50 etc. for length violates fundamental mathematical properties.

3. **Inconsistent with NumPy/Python**: Python and NumPy always return 0 for empty slices, never negative values. The function should match this behavior.

4. **Real Impact**: This is used internally in pandas for validation and could cause incorrect behavior in downstream code expecting non-negative lengths.

5. **Clear Fix Available**: The bug report provides a reasonable fix that would make the function behavior consistent with Python slicing.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None substantial. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

#### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug report is accurate and well-documented.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The reproduction clearly shows the function returns negative values
2. NumPy slicing does produce length 0 for these cases
3. The bug report correctly identifies the issue

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. This is an internal function not in the public API
2. Might argue empty slices are edge cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Used internally in pandas, so incorrect behavior could affect pandas operations
2. Not an obscure edge case - empty slices are common in real code
3. Violates a fundamental property (non-negative length)
4. The fix is simple and improves correctness

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could argue the documentation should specify behavior for empty slices

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation is clear: "expected length" means what len() would return
2. The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
3. No reasonable documentation would specify negative lengths as valid

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This isn't requesting new functionality.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function already exists and has defined behavior
2. This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding features
3. The expected behavior (returning 0 for empty slices) is standard

### Analysis Summary

The function `length_of_indexer` incorrectly returns negative values for certain valid slice configurations that produce empty sequences. This violates:

1. **The function's contract**: "Return the expected length" - negative lengths are never expected
2. **Mathematical properties**: Length is always >= 0
3. **Python/NumPy consistency**: Empty slices have length 0, not negative
4. **Type semantics**: Returning int doesn't mean negative ints are valid for a length function

The bug occurs because the calculation `(stop - start + step - 1) // step` can produce negative results when slices would be empty, particularly:
- When start >= stop with positive step
- When transformed start >= stop with negative step

This is a legitimate bug in the implementation logic that should be fixed to return 0 for empty slices.
