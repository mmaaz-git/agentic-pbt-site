## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The reported bug has been successfully reproduced. When a DataFrame contains integer values outside the int64 range (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807), `to_json()` successfully serializes them to JSON, but `read_json()` crashes with `ValueError: Value is too small` (or "Value is too big" for large positive values).

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Property-Based Test**: The hypothesis test successfully identified the bug with the exact input mentioned in the report:
   - Input: `data=[{'0': -9223372036854775809}], orient='split'`
   - Result: `ValueError: Value is too small`
   - The error occurs with all orient values ('split', 'records', 'index', 'columns', 'values')

2. **Minimal Example**: Confirmed the specific behavior:
   - Value -9223372036854775809 (one less than int64 min):
     - `to_json()` succeeds, producing valid JSON
     - `read_json()` fails with "Value is too small"
   - Value -9223372036854775808 (exactly int64 min):
     - Both operations succeed

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The issue lies in pandas' use of ujson (ultra-fast JSON) library
   - `ujson_dumps` can serialize Python integers of any size
   - `ujson_loads` cannot deserialize integers outside the int64 range
   - This creates an asymmetry: data that can be written cannot be read back

### Technical Details
- DataFrame stores the large integer as Python object dtype (not int64)
- Python's built-in json module handles arbitrary precision integers correctly
- The ujson library used by pandas has a hard limit on integer size during deserialization
- The error occurs in the ujson C extension, not in pandas Python code

### Impact
This is a data integrity issue where valid DataFrames can be serialized but not deserialized, potentially causing data loss in production systems that rely on JSON serialization for data persistence or transfer.
