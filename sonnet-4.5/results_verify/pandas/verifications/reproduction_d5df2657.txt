REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. Here are my findings:

1. Direct Reproduction:
   - Running `pandas.util.hash_array(arr, hash_key="short")` with an object array indeed raises:
     `ValueError: key should be a 16-byte string encoded, got b'short' (len 5)`
   - The error occurs deep in the Cython implementation as reported.

2. Hypothesis Test Confirmation:
   - The property-based test fails as expected for any hash_key that is not exactly 16 bytes
   - Multiple test cases with various string lengths all fail with the same error pattern
   - The error message consistently shows the actual byte length vs the expected 16 bytes

3. Additional Findings:
   - When providing exactly 16 ASCII characters (e.g., 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'), the function works correctly
   - For numeric arrays (dtype=int64), the hash_key parameter is silently ignored - no error occurs even with invalid keys
   - This inconsistency confirms the bug report's observation about different behavior for different dtypes

4. Error Location:
   - The error originates from pandas/_libs/hashing.pyx as reported
   - The validation happens in low-level Cython/C code, not at the Python API level
   - The stack trace shows multiple layers before reaching the actual validation

The bug is reproducible exactly as described in the report.
