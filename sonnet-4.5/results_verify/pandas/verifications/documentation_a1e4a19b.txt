## Documentation Analysis for pandas.api.typing.NaTType and NAType

### Key Findings from Documentation:

1. **Purpose of pandas.api.typing module**:
   - The pandas.api.typing module contains "Classes that may be necessary for type-hinting."
   - Documentation explicitly states these are "classes that are encountered as intermediate results but should not be instantiated directly by users."
   - These types were added to pandas.api.typing for typing/type-hinting purposes.

2. **NAType and pd.NA**:
   - NAType docstring clearly describes NA as a "singleton" missing value indicator
   - The documentation states: "The NA singleton is a missing value indicator defined by pandas"
   - NAType() correctly returns the singleton pd.NA instance when called

3. **NaTType and pd.NaT**:
   - NaTType docstring describes it as "(N)ot-(A)-(T)ime, the time equivalent of NaN"
   - pd.NaT is documented as a singleton value representing missing datetime data
   - However, there is NO explicit documentation stating that NaTType() should or should not return the singleton pd.NaT

4. **Important Context**:
   - The types in pandas.api.typing were moved there from private modules (_libs) for typing purposes
   - The module documentation states these classes "should not be instantiated directly by users"
   - Both NaTType and NAType are subclasses of their respective internal implementations

### Documentation Gaps:

The documentation does not explicitly specify:
- Whether NaTType() is intended to be callable as a constructor
- Whether NaTType() should return new instances or the singleton pd.NaT
- The expected behavior when users call NaTType() despite the warning not to instantiate directly

### Conclusion:

The documentation suggests these types are primarily for type-hinting and "should not be instantiated directly by users." This is a critical point - if users shouldn't be instantiating these directly, then the behavior when they do call NaTType() is arguably undefined/unspecified. The bug report assumes NaTType() should behave like NAType() and return the singleton, but this is not explicitly documented.
