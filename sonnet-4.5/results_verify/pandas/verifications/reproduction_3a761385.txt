## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue manifests in two different ways:

### 1. Empty String to NaN Conversion

When a DataFrame contains empty strings mixed with other data, the empty strings are converted to NaN during the Excel round-trip:

- Original: `['active', '']`
- After round-trip: `['active', nan]`

This conversion happens because:
1. `to_excel()` writes empty strings as empty Excel cells (None values)
2. `read_excel()` with default settings interprets empty cells as NaN

**Workaround exists**: Using `read_excel(filepath, na_filter=False)` or `read_excel(filepath, keep_default_na=False)` preserves empty strings correctly.

### 2. Complete Row Loss

More seriously, when a DataFrame row contains ONLY empty strings, the entire row is lost:

- Original DataFrame: shape (1, 1) with value `[['']]`
- After round-trip: shape (0, 1) - empty DataFrame with only column headers

This happens because:
1. `to_excel()` writes empty strings as empty cells
2. Excel/openpyxl doesn't consider rows with only empty cells as actual data rows
3. `read_excel()` sees no data rows and returns an empty DataFrame

This row loss occurs regardless of `na_filter` or `keep_default_na` settings.

### Testing Details

The Hypothesis test correctly identifies this bug with the failing input `data=[['']]`. The test fails with:
```
AssertionError: DataFrame are different
DataFrame shape mismatch
[left]:  (1, 1)
[right]: (0, 1)
```

Manual testing confirms both issues consistently. The bug affects data integrity in a silent manner with no warnings to the user.
