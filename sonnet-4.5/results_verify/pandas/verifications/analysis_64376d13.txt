## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if we argue that the function was never intended to work with built-in Python modules like 'sys' that don't have version attributes. The function is designed for optional dependencies (third-party packages), not standard library modules. Using it with 'sys' could be considered misuse of the API.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states the behavior for `errors='ignore'` and `errors='warn'` without any caveat about modules that lack version information. The docstring clearly says "return the module, even if the version is too old" for ignore mode, which should logically extend to cases where version cannot be determined. The function already successfully imports 'sys' - it only fails during version checking, which the errors parameter should handle.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be WONTFIX if we consider that using `import_optional_dependency` with built-in Python modules is an edge case that would never occur in real pandas usage. The function is meant for managing optional third-party dependencies like matplotlib, not standard library modules. The effort to fix this might not be worth it for such an obscure use case.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug violates the documented contract of the function. Even if it's an edge case, the documentation promises specific behavior for `errors='ignore'` and `errors='warn'` that isn't being delivered. The fix is straightforward and improves the robustness of the function. Additionally, there may be legitimate reasons to version-check standard library modules in some contexts.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to clarify that the function is only intended for use with packages that have version information available. We could add a note that modules without `__version__` attributes will raise ImportError regardless of the errors parameter. This would align the documentation with the current behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation already clearly states what should happen with `errors='ignore'` - return the module even if version checking fails. Changing the documentation to match the buggy behavior would be backwards, as the documented behavior is more sensible and user-friendly. The code should be fixed to match the documentation, not vice versa.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting modules without version information could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The function was originally designed for packages with version information, and extending it to handle modules without versions gracefully could be considered an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not requesting new functionality but asking for the function to behave as already documented. The docstring explicitly describes how `errors='ignore'` and `errors='warn'` should behave, and this behavior is not being provided. It's fixing existing functionality to match its specification, not adding something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function clearly violates its documented contract. The docstring explicitly states that with `errors='ignore'`, the function should "return the module, even if the version is too old," which logically extends to cases where version cannot be determined. The implementation fails to handle the ImportError from `get_version()` before checking the `errors` parameter, causing it to raise exceptions when it should not. This is a clear discrepancy between documented and actual behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
One could argue that the function was never meant to handle modules without version information, and that "version is too old" is different from "version cannot be determined." The documentation might not have anticipated this edge case, and the current behavior could be considered correct for the intended use cases with third-party packages.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a valid BUG. The function's documentation makes explicit promises about the behavior of `errors='ignore'` and `errors='warn'` that are not being fulfilled. The docstring states that with `errors='ignore'`, the module should be returned "even if the version is too old," and that users should validate versions locally when using this mode. This strongly implies that version-checking failures should be handled gracefully, not cause exceptions.

The bug is technically correct and well-documented. The reproduction clearly shows that the function raises ImportError when the documentation says it should not. The root cause is accurately identified: the `get_version()` call raises an exception before the `errors` parameter can be evaluated. The proposed fix correctly addresses this by wrapping the version check in appropriate exception handling that respects the `errors` parameter.

While it's true that using `import_optional_dependency` with standard library modules might be uncommon, this doesn't invalidate the bug. The function accepts any module name and promises specific behavior based on the `errors` parameter. If the maintainers intended to restrict this to only packages with version information, that should be documented or enforced differently. As it stands, the function violates its documented contract, which makes this a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
