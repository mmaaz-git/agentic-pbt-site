DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Status:
- The function `length_of_indexer` is an internal pandas utility function (in pandas.core.indexers.utils)
- It is NOT part of the public API (not listed in pandas reference documentation)
- It has minimal documentation - just a brief docstring stating "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"

Function Purpose:
Based on the code and usage analysis, this function is designed to compute the expected length when indexing operations are applied. It handles multiple indexer types:
1. Slices (with optional target)
2. Arrays, Series, Index objects, and lists
3. Range objects
4. Single scalars

Key Observations:

1. No Specification for Range Handling:
   - The docstring doesn't specify how range objects should be handled
   - There are no tests for range objects in the test suite
   - The function is clearly meant to return the same result as len(indexer) for iterable indexers

2. Consistency Expectation:
   - For slices, the function uses formula: (stop - start + step - 1) // step (correct ceiling division)
   - For ranges, it uses: (stop - start) // step (incorrect floor division)
   - This inconsistency is not documented or justified

3. Semantic Expectations:
   - The function name "length_of_indexer" strongly implies it should return the number of elements the indexer would select
   - For any Python iterable like range, the natural expectation is that length_of_indexer(r) == len(r)
   - The current implementation violates this basic expectation

4. Internal vs External:
   - This is an internal utility function, not part of the public API
   - However, it's used by other pandas internals (core/indexing.py) so correctness matters
   - The bug could cause silent data corruption in indexing operations

Conclusion:
While there's no explicit documentation stating how range objects should be handled, the function's purpose and name clearly indicate it should return the correct length of the indexer. The current implementation is mathematically incorrect and inconsistent with how it handles similar indexer types (slices). This is a genuine bug, not a documentation issue.
