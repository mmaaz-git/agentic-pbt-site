TRIAGE ANALYSIS

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

BUG (VALID):
Arguments FOR:
- Public API property crashes with unhandled ZeroDivisionError
- Empty SparseArrays are valid objects (constructor accepts empty arrays)
- Other SparseArray operations work on empty arrays (len, nbytes, etc.)
- The crash violates principle of least surprise - users expect properties to be safe
- The fix is straightforward and reasonable (return 0.0 or NaN)
- This is a clear oversight in the implementation that doesn't handle edge cases

Arguments AGAINST:
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise empty array support
- Could argue that density is undefined for empty sets

INVALID:
Arguments FOR:
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state empty arrays should work
- Mathematical division by zero is technically "correct" behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- Creating empty arrays is supported by the API
- Public properties shouldn't crash with arithmetic exceptions
- The error is not intentional or documented behavior

WONTFIX:
Arguments FOR:
- Empty SparseArrays might be considered an obscure edge case
- Users could work around by checking length first

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not an obscure case - empty collections are common
- The fix is trivial and improves API robustness
- Property access shouldn't require defensive coding by users

FEATURE_REQUEST:
Arguments FOR:
- Could frame as "add support for empty arrays to density"

Arguments AGAINST:
- Empty arrays are already supported by SparseArray
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The property exists but fails - it's not a new feature

DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
Arguments FOR:
- Could document that density raises ZeroDivisionError for empty arrays

Arguments AGAINST:
- This would be documenting a bug, not fixing incorrect documentation
- The current behavior is clearly unintended
- Users shouldn't need to handle arithmetic exceptions for property access

CONCLUSION:
This is clearly a BUG. A public property on a valid object (empty SparseArray) should not crash with an unhandled ZeroDivisionError. The fact that SparseArray supports empty arrays in its constructor but fails on density access is an implementation oversight. The fix is trivial and makes the API more robust.
