DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR is_subperiod AND is_superperiod
===========================================================

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
The functions is_subperiod and is_superperiod are not part of the public pandas API and do not have official user-facing documentation. They are internal functions in pandas.tseries.frequencies module.

2. DOCSTRING ANALYSIS:
From the source code (pandas/tseries/frequencies.py):

is_subperiod(source, target):
    """
    Returns True if downsampling is possible between source and target
    frequencies

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : str or DateOffset
        Frequency converting from
    target : str or DateOffset
        Frequency converting to

    Returns
    -------
    bool
    """

is_superperiod(source, target):
    """
    Returns True if upsampling is possible between source and target
    frequencies

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : str or DateOffset
        Frequency converting from
    target : str or DateOffset
        Frequency converting to

    Returns
    -------
    bool
    """

3. SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION:
- is_subperiod(source, target) checks if we can DOWNSAMPLE from source to target
  (e.g., going from daily data to monthly data)
- is_superperiod(source, target) checks if we can UPSAMPLE from source to target
  (e.g., going from monthly data to daily data)

4. EXPECTED SYMMETRY:
The docstrings establish that these functions are inverses:
- If is_subperiod(A, B) is True (can downsample A→B), then logically is_superperiod(B, A) should also be True (can upsample B→A)
- This is the fundamental relationship between upsampling and downsampling

5. PRIOR BUG REPORTS:
GitHub Issue #18553 (still open) reports similar inconsistencies:
- The issue notes that is_subperiod(x, x) doesn't consistently return the same value for all frequencies
- Maintainers acknowledged this seems unintuitive but haven't reached consensus on expected behavior
- One maintainer suggested the internal usage might require not returning True for equal frequencies

6. INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL USE:
These functions appear to be primarily for internal pandas use in resampling operations. The lack of public documentation and the underscore-prefixed helper functions (_is_annual, _is_quarterly) suggest these are implementation details rather than public APIs.

7. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
- No clear specification of what should happen when source == target
- No explicit statement about whether symmetry should hold
- No documentation about the relationship between B (business day) and D (calendar day) frequencies
- The functions are not mentioned in the main pandas documentation or API reference
