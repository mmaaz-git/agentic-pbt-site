## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully ran the bug report's test cases and confirmed the following behavior:

1. **Direct Reproduction Test**
   - Code: `kleene_xor([False], [False], [True], [True])` where mask=[True] means NA
   - Current behavior: Returns result=[False], mask=[True] (i.e., NA)
   - Bug report expects: result=[False], mask=[False] (i.e., False)
   - **CONFIRMED**: The function returns NA for NA ^ NA

2. **Pandas Series Test**
   - Code: `pd.Series([True, False, pd.NA]) ^ pd.Series([True, False, pd.NA])`
   - Current behavior: `[False, False, <NA>]`
   - Bug report expects: `[False, False, False]`
   - **CONFIRMED**: NA ^ NA returns NA in pandas Series operations

3. **XOR Combinations Test**
   - True ^ True = False (unmasked) ✓ CORRECT
   - False ^ False = False (unmasked) ✓ CORRECT
   - NA ^ NA = NA (masked) - Bug report claims this should be False (unmasked)
   - True ^ NA = NA (masked) ✓ EXPECTED
   - False ^ NA = NA (masked) ✓ EXPECTED

4. **Property Test**
   - The hypothesis test fails as reported
   - Assertion fails on: "x ^ x should not be masked (even for NA)"
   - Current implementation masks the result when both inputs are masked

### Technical Analysis
The current implementation uses this logic for masks:
```python
mask = left_mask | right_mask
```
This means any position where either operand is NA will result in NA, including when both operands are NA at the same position.

The bug report's proposed fix would check if both values are equal when both are masked, and unmask the result in that case.

### Mathematical Correctness
The current behavior (NA ^ NA = NA) aligns with standard Kleene three-valued logic where U ^ U = U. The bug report's expectation (NA ^ NA = False) assumes a different semantic interpretation where NA values at the same position represent "the same unknown value" rather than independent unknowns.
