## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs in the `fill_mi_header` function in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/excel/_util.py`.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test fails with the exact input mentioned in the bug report:
- Input: `row=[1, 1], control_row=[False, False]` (after setting row[1] to None)
- The test expects all None values to be forward-filled, but position 1 remains None

### Manual Reproduction Results
Running the manual test case confirms the bug:
- Input: `row=[1, None], control_row=[False, False]`
- Expected output: `[1, 1]` (forward fill None with 1)
- Actual output: `[1, None]` (None is not filled)

### Root Cause Analysis
Tracing through the code execution reveals the exact problem:

1. Initial state: `last = 1` (from row[0])
2. At iteration 1 (i=1):
   - `control_row[1]` is False, so the code executes: `last = row[1]`
   - Since `row[1]` is None, this sets `last = None`
   - Next, the code checks if `row[1]` is None and tries to fill it: `row[1] = last`
   - But `last` is now None, so it fills None with None

The bug occurs because the code unconditionally updates `last` when `control_row[i]` is False, even when `row[i]` is a blank value (None or empty string). This breaks the forward-fill chain by resetting the "last valid value" to a blank value.

### Effect
The function fails to perform forward-filling as expected when:
1. A None value appears in the row
2. The corresponding control_row value is False
3. This results in None values not being filled with the last non-None value

This is a clear violation of the function's documented behavior to "forward fill blank entries."
