## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments For:**
- The round-trip property `ujson_loads(ujson_dumps(x)) == x` is violated for valid float values
- The stdlib json module handles this correctly, setting a reasonable expectation
- Loss of precision (2.0 in this case) is significant and could cause data corruption
- JSON is commonly expected to preserve numeric precision within the limits of IEEE 754 doubles

**Arguments Against:**
- ujson is explicitly a performance-focused library that may trade precision for speed
- The documentation mentions `double_precision` parameter, implying precision is configurable/limited
- No explicit round-trip guarantee is documented for ujson

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- ujson has a hard-coded maximum precision of 15 digits, which is a design limitation
- The library is optimized for speed over precision, which is its intended use case
- Users who need precision can use stdlib json or set double_precision=15
- The failing value (1.0000000000000002e+16) is at the edge of float precision

**Arguments Against:**
- Even with double_precision=15 (maximum), the precision is still lost
- The loss is not just rounding error but actual data loss (2.0 difference)
- No workaround exists within ujson to preserve this precision

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- No documentation explicitly guarantees round-trip equality for all floats
- ujson is a third-party library with its own limitations

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- Round-trip preservation is a reasonable expectation for JSON serialization
- The issue causes actual data loss, not just formatting differences

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The pandas documentation should warn about ujson's precision limitations
- Users should be informed when to use stdlib json vs ujson
- The default precision value should be documented
- Clear guidance on the trade-offs between speed and precision is missing

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not just a documentation issue; there's actual functionality loss
- Documenting a limitation doesn't make it not a bug

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be seen as requesting enhanced precision beyond current ujson capabilities
- Asking for behavior that ujson was not designed to provide

**Arguments Against:**
- Round-trip preservation is a basic expectation, not a new feature
- The stdlib json already provides this, so it's not an unreasonable request

## Conclusion
This is a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. While the precision loss is real, it stems from ujson's fundamental design as a speed-optimized JSON library that intentionally trades precision for performance. The real issue is that pandas users are not adequately warned about this limitation. The pandas documentation should:

1. Clearly state that ujson_dumps/ujson_loads may lose precision for large floats
2. Document the default and maximum precision settings
3. Recommend using stdlib json when precision is critical
4. Provide examples of when precision loss occurs

The bug report correctly identifies the behavior, but the root cause is an inherent limitation of the ujson library that cannot be fixed without fundamentally changing its design. The appropriate response is to better document this limitation so users can make informed choices.
