## Documentation Analysis

### Class Documentation Review:
The SAS7BDATReader class docstring focuses on the public API parameters (path_or_buf, index, convert_dates, etc.) but does not document the internal implementation details or instance variables like `_current_row_in_file_index`, `_current_row_on_page_index`, or `_current_row_in_chunk_index`.

### Internal Variable Analysis:
These are private instance variables (prefixed with underscore) that are part of the internal implementation, not the public API. The documentation does not specify:
- How many row tracking variables should exist
- What each should track specifically
- Whether they should all be initialized in `__init__`

### Usage Pattern Found:
1. `_current_row_in_file_index`: Tracks the current row position in the entire file
   - Initialized twice in __init__ (lines 205, 207) - DUPLICATE
   - Used in lines 674, 677, 722 for boundary checking and position tracking

2. `_current_row_on_page_index`: Tracks the current row position on the current page
   - Initialized once in __init__ (line 206)
   - Not found in usage search (might be used in other methods)

3. `_current_row_in_chunk_index`: Tracks the current row position within a chunk
   - NOT initialized in __init__
   - Set to 0 on line 685 when needed
   - Used on lines 721-722

### Documentation Verdict:
Since these are internal implementation details not covered by documentation, there is no documented "correct" behavior. The code must be evaluated based on:
1. General programming best practices (no duplicate code)
2. Consistency with the rest of the implementation
3. Whether the current implementation causes functional issues

The documentation neither requires nor prohibits:
- Having duplicate assignments
- Initializing all variables in `__init__`
- The specific pattern of row tracking

This is purely an implementation detail issue, not a violation of documented behavior.
