## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The docstring explicitly states the method exists "to make it more file-like"
2. Python's standard file-like objects have idempotent close() methods by design
3. The Python I/O documentation explicitly states close() should be callable multiple times
4. The implementation violates a fundamental contract of file-like objects
5. This can break legitimate code patterns (finally blocks, defensive programming, context managers with explicit close)
6. The bug is not obscure - calling close() twice is a common defensive pattern
7. No documentation warns about this non-standard behavior
8. The fix is simple and wouldn't break existing code

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise idempotency
2. Users could track whether they've called close() themselves

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The docstring claims to be "file-like" which has a well-defined meaning in Python
2. Standard Python file behavior IS explicitly documented to be idempotent
3. Requiring users to track close() state violates the principle of least surprise

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. Users can work around this by catching the exception
2. It only affects code that calls close() multiple times

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - defensive close() patterns are common
2. The bug violates standard Python conventions
3. The fix is trivial and non-breaking
4. This affects real-world usage patterns (finally blocks, error handlers)

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Could update docs to warn that close() is not idempotent
2. Could remove the "file-like" claim from the docstring

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
2. Making close() idempotent is the correct fix, not documenting the bug
3. File-like objects in Python have a well-established contract

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Idempotent close() could be considered a "new feature"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. The method claims to be "file-like" but isn't - that's a bug
3. Standard Python file behavior is not a "feature" - it's expected behavior

### Summary
This is a clear BUG. The ExcelWriter.close() method:
- Claims to make the object "more file-like"
- Violates the fundamental contract of file-like objects in Python
- Breaks legitimate, common usage patterns
- Has no documentation warning about non-standard behavior
- Is easily fixable without breaking changes

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, and identifies a real problem that should be fixed.
