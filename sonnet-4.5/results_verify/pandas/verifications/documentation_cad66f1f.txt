## Documentation Analysis for numpy.char.title

### NumPy Documentation Claims

The official numpy.char.title documentation makes the following explicit claim:
- **"Calls :meth:`str.title` element-wise."**

This appears in both:
1. The function's docstring (confirmed via char.title.__doc__)
2. The official NumPy documentation website

The documentation is unambiguous: numpy.char.title should behave identically to Python's str.title() method, just applied element-wise to arrays.

### Python str.title() Behavior

Python's str.title() has well-defined Unicode behavior:
1. It performs Unicode-aware titlecasing according to Unicode standards
2. For the German ß (sharp s), Python's title() converts it to 'Ss' (two characters)
3. For ligatures (ﬁ, ﬂ, ﬀ), Python expands them to their multi-character titlecase forms ('Fi', 'Fl', 'Ff')

This behavior is consistent with Unicode's SpecialCasing.txt rules which define one-to-many character mappings for proper titlecasing.

### Actual numpy.char.title Implementation

Looking at the source code:
```python
def title(a):
    a_arr = np.asarray(a)
    return _vec_string(a_arr, a_arr.dtype, 'title')
```

The function uses `_vec_string` with 'title' operation, which appears to be a C-level implementation that does NOT actually call Python's str.title() method.

### Documentation vs Reality

There is a clear contradiction:
- **Documentation states**: "Calls :meth:`str.title` element-wise"
- **Actual behavior**: Uses a different implementation that doesn't handle Unicode expansions
- **Result**: Different outputs for characters requiring expansion (ß → 'S' instead of 'Ss', ﬁ → 'F' instead of 'Fi')

### Conclusion on Documentation

The numpy.char.title documentation is incorrect. It explicitly claims to call Python's str.title() element-wise, but the actual implementation uses a different algorithm that doesn't properly handle Unicode character expansions. This is a clear contract violation where the documented behavior does not match the actual behavior.
