## Documentation Analysis

### Official pandas Documentation Review

1. **DataFrame.T Property Documentation**:
   - States that it returns the transposed DataFrame
   - Swaps index and columns
   - No explicit mention of dtype preservation behavior

2. **DataFrame.transpose() Method Documentation**:
   - Key finding: Documentation states "A copy is always required for mixed dtype DataFrames"
   - States that for mixed-dtype DataFrames, the result converts to object dtype
   - However, this is NOT what actually happens for numeric mixed types (int/float)

3. **Actual vs Documented Behavior**:
   - Documentation claims: Mixed dtypes → object dtype
   - Actual behavior: Mixed numeric dtypes (int/float) → float64
   - Only non-numeric mixed types (e.g., string/int) → object dtype

### Mathematical Expectations

The transpose operation in linear algebra has the property that (A^T)^T = A. While pandas DataFrames are not strictly mathematical matrices, users reasonably expect:
- df.T.T should equal df
- This includes preserving data types, not just values

### Documentation Gaps

1. No explicit statement about dtype preservation during transpose
2. Incorrect documentation about mixed-dtype behavior (says object, but uses float64 for numeric types)
3. No warning about potential dtype loss during transpose operations
4. No mention that df.T.T may not equal df exactly due to dtype coercion

### Conclusion

The documentation is incomplete and partially incorrect regarding dtype handling during transpose operations. It does not warn users about the loss of integer types when transposing mixed numeric DataFrames.
