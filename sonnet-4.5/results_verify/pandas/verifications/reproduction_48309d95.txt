## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully ran the bug report's test cases and can confirm the technical accuracy of the reported behavior.

### Confirmed Behaviors

**For Infinity:**
- `Infinity > Infinity` returns `True` (violates reflexivity - should be False)
- `Infinity <= Infinity` returns `False` (violates reflexivity - should be True)
- `Infinity == Infinity` returns `True` (correct)
- `Infinity >= Infinity` returns `True` (correct)
- `Infinity < Infinity` returns `False` (correct)

**For NegativeInfinity:**
- `NegativeInfinity < NegativeInfinity` returns `True` (violates reflexivity - should be False)
- `NegativeInfinity >= NegativeInfinity` returns `False` (violates reflexivity - should be True)
- `NegativeInfinity == NegativeInfinity` returns `True` (correct)
- `NegativeInfinity <= NegativeInfinity` returns `True` (correct)
- `NegativeInfinity > NegativeInfinity` returns `False` (correct)

### Upstream Behavior Verification
I tested the original packaging library (from which this code was vendored) and confirmed it has THE EXACT SAME BEHAVIOR. The non-reflexive comparison operators are present in the upstream library as well.

### Code Analysis
Looking at the implementation:
- InfinityType.__gt__ always returns `True`, causing `Infinity > Infinity` to be True
- InfinityType.__le__ always returns `False`, causing `Infinity <= Infinity` to be False
- NegativeInfinityType.__lt__ always returns `True`, causing `NegativeInfinity < NegativeInfinity` to be True
- NegativeInfinityType.__ge__ always returns `False`, causing `NegativeInfinity >= NegativeInfinity` to be False

### Important Context
1. This code is vendored from the PyPA packaging library, not originally written by pandas
2. The behavior matches the upstream library exactly
3. These are internal utility classes for version comparison, not general-purpose infinity objects
4. The classes are in a private module (pandas.util) not intended for public use

### Conclusion
The bug report is technically accurate - the comparison operators do violate mathematical reflexivity properties. However, this is inherited behavior from the upstream packaging library that pandas vendored.
