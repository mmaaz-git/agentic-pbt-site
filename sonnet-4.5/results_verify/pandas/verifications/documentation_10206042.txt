# Documentation Analysis

## Pandas Documentation Findings

### FixedForwardWindowIndexer Documentation
The official pandas documentation for FixedForwardWindowIndexer is minimal:
- Describes the class as "Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
- Provides a simple usage example but does not detail parameter constraints
- Does not specify valid values for any parameters of get_window_bounds

### get_window_bounds Method Documentation
From the method's docstring:
- The `step` parameter is described as "step passed from the top level rolling API"
- Added in version 1.5
- Default value is None (which becomes 1 in the implementation)
- **No documentation about valid values or constraints for step**
- No mention that step must be positive
- No warning about step=0 causing errors

## NumPy Documentation Findings

### numpy.arange Documentation
- The step parameter is described as "spacing between values"
- Default step is 1
- **The documentation does NOT explicitly mention what happens with step=0**
- No warning about ZeroDivisionError with step=0
- No statement that step must be non-zero

### Actual numpy.arange Behavior
Testing confirms that `np.arange(0, 10, 0)` raises `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`

## Key Documentation Gaps

1. **Pandas gaps:**
   - No documentation of valid step values
   - No warning about step=0 or negative step values
   - No specification of expected errors for invalid input

2. **NumPy gaps:**
   - numpy.arange documentation doesn't warn about step=0
   - The ZeroDivisionError is undocumented behavior

3. **API Contract Issues:**
   - Neither pandas nor numpy documentation establishes that step must be positive
   - The error behavior is completely undocumented at both levels
   - Users have no way to know from documentation that step=0 is invalid

## Conclusion
The documentation does not specify that step must be positive or non-zero. This is an undocumented constraint that only becomes apparent when the code crashes. The bug report's claim about "API contract violation" is somewhat valid, though there is no explicit contract about step values in the documentation. The lack of input validation and the unhelpful error message are legitimate issues given the documentation gaps.
