BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

I will analyze this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
   =========================================
   Arguments FOR:
   - Clear symmetry violation: is_subperiod('D', 'B') returns False while is_superperiod('B', 'D') returns True
   - The functions claim to check if resampling is possible, and pandas DOES support D<->B resampling
   - The mathematical relationship between downsampling and upsampling requires symmetry
   - Actual pandas.resample() works in both directions (D to B and B to D)
   - The inconsistency breaks user expectations and could lead to incorrect program logic
   - Similar issue (#18553) was already acknowledged as a bug by pandas developers

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Functions might be internal utilities not meant for direct user consumption
   - Could be intentional design choice (though undocumented)

2. INVALID (Incorrect report, code works as designed)
   ==================================================
   Arguments FOR:
   - The functions might intentionally have different semantics we don't understand
   - Could be legacy behavior that's maintained for backward compatibility

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The docstrings clearly state these check for resampling possibility
   - Pandas actually supports the resampling operations in question
   - No documentation suggests this asymmetry is intentional
   - The mathematical relationship requires symmetry

3. WONTFIX (Trivial or uninteresting)
   =====================================
   Arguments FOR:
   - These appear to be internal utility functions
   - Most users would use resample() directly, not these check functions
   - The impact might be minimal in practice

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The functions are publicly accessible and documented
   - Incorrect behavior in utility functions can cascade to other parts of the codebase
   - The asymmetry is fundamentally wrong mathematically

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
   ==========================================
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue that proper D<->B frequency checking is a new feature

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The functions already exist and claim to do this checking
   - is_superperiod already works correctly for B->D
   - This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Docs are wrong)
   ====================================
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could update docs to say "these functions have known asymmetry issues"
   - Could document that D->B checking is not supported

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code is wrong, not the documentation
   - The documentation correctly describes what the functions SHOULD do
   - Pandas actually supports the operations these functions claim to check

CONCLUSION:
===========
This is clearly a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. Mathematical correctness: Downsampling and upsampling are inverse operations. If you can go from B to D (which is_superperiod correctly identifies), you must be able to go from D to B.

2. Pandas functionality: The resample() method successfully handles both D->B and B->D conversions, proving these operations are valid and supported.

3. Docstring contract: The functions explicitly claim to check if resampling is possible. Since resampling IS possible between D and B, the function returning False is objectively wrong.

4. Symmetry violation: The asymmetry between is_subperiod('D','B') and is_superperiod('B','D') is a clear logic error with no documented justification.

5. Prior acknowledgment: GitHub issue #18553 shows similar issues were already recognized as bugs by the pandas team.

This is not a documentation issue (docs are correct), not a missing feature (the function exists), not invalid (the report accurately describes incorrect behavior), and not trivial (mathematical correctness matters in a data analysis library).
