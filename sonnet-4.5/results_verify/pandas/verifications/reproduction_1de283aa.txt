## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed:

### Test Results:

1. **hash_array() with empty input**:
   - Successfully handles empty numpy array
   - Returns an empty numpy array with dtype=uint64
   - No errors raised

2. **hash_tuples() with empty input**:
   - Crashes with TypeError: "Cannot infer number of levels from empty list"
   - Does not handle empty lists gracefully
   - Fails exactly as described in the bug report

3. **Hypothesis test**:
   - The test case provided in the bug report fails with the same TypeError
   - The expected behavior (returning an empty uint64 array) is not met

### Conclusion:
The bug is reproducible. There is indeed an inconsistency between hash_array() and hash_tuples() in handling empty inputs. While hash_array() gracefully returns an empty uint64 array, hash_tuples() raises a TypeError when given an empty list.
