## Documentation Analysis

### ExtensionArray.insert() Documentation
The pandas documentation for ExtensionArray.insert() states:
1. The method should "Insert an item at the given position"
2. It should be "both type and dtype-preserving"
3. "If the item cannot be held in an array of this type/dtype, either ValueError or TypeError should be raised"
4. The default implementation "relies on _from_sequence to raise on invalid items"

### ArrowExtensionArray Documentation
- ArrowExtensionArray is marked as "experimental"
- Most methods are implemented using PyArrow compute functions
- Some methods might raise exceptions or PerformanceWarnings
- No specific documentation exists for the insert() method on ArrowExtensionArray

### PyArrow Null Type Documentation
- The null type represents a type that cannot hold any values
- It's essentially a placeholder type used for type representation and schema definition
- PyArrow allows casting FROM null to other types (e.g., null to int64)
- PyArrow does NOT allow casting TO null from other types (e.g., int64 to null)

### Key Documentation Findings
1. The documentation says insert() should raise ValueError or TypeError if the item cannot be held in the array
2. However, the actual error is ArrowNotImplementedError, which is neither ValueError nor TypeError
3. The documentation does not explicitly address the case of inserting non-None values into null-type arrays
4. There is no clear guidance on whether null-type arrays should be automatically promoted to a more specific type when non-None values are inserted

### Documentation Gaps
- No explicit mention of how null-type arrays should behave with insert()
- No guidance on whether type promotion is expected or forbidden for null arrays
- The error type (ArrowNotImplementedError) doesn't match the documented expectation (ValueError/TypeError)
