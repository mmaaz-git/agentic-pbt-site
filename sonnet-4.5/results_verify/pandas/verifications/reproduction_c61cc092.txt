REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I successfully reproduced the reported behavior and confirmed the technical details are accurate.

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION CONFIRMED:
Using the example provided in the bug report with categories=[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] and data containing [2, 0]:
- With sort=True: Result index is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] (categorical order)
- With sort=False: Result index is [2, 0, 5, 4, 3, 1] (observed first, then unobserved)

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST CASE CONFIRMED:
The minimal failing case with keys=[0], values=[0.0]:
- With sort=True: Index is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] (categorical order maintained)
- With sort=False: Index is [0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] (observed value 0 appears first)

3. BEHAVIOR PATTERN IDENTIFIED:
The current behavior with sort=False and observed=False appears to:
- Place observed categories first, in their order of appearance in the data
- Then append unobserved categories in their categorical order
- This creates the hybrid ordering like [2, 0, 5, 4, 3, 1] or [0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

4. CONSISTENCY WITH UNORDERED CATEGORICALS:
I also tested with ordered=False categorical:
- The same behavior occurs - observed categories first, then unobserved
- This suggests the issue affects both ordered and unordered categoricals

5. THE BUG REPORT IS TECHNICALLY ACCURATE:
- The test code runs without errors
- The described behavior matches exactly what happens
- The assertion that sort=False produces different ordering than sort=True is correct
- The claim that this violates categorical ordering is factually true

6. VERIFICATION OF CLAIMS:
The bug report claims that with categorical data and observed=False:
- sort=True respects categorical order: CONFIRMED
- sort=False does not respect categorical order: CONFIRMED
- Observed categories appear first in appearance order: CONFIRMED
- Unobserved categories follow: CONFIRMED

All technical claims in the bug report have been verified as accurate.
