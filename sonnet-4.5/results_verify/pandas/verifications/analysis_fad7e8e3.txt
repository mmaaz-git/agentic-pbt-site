BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

CONSIDERING EACH CATEGORY:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE INVALID:
   - None - the bug is clearly reproducible

   WHY IT'S NOT INVALID:
   - The bug report is correct and accurate
   - The test cases reproduce the issue exactly as described
   - The documentation explicitly guarantees uniqueness preservation
   - The implementation clearly violates this guarantee

   VERDICT: NOT INVALID

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE WONTFIX:
   - The differences between percentiles (1e-5) are extremely small
   - In practical use cases, percentiles this close might not be meaningful
   - Users are unlikely to encounter this in real-world data analysis

   WHY IT'S NOT WONTFIX:
   - The function makes an explicit documented guarantee
   - Violating documented behavior is not trivial
   - The function could be used programmatically where precision matters
   - The fix is straightforward (adjust tolerance in np.isclose)

   VERDICT: POSSIBLY WONTFIX if maintainers consider it too edge-case

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - None - the documentation already promises this behavior

   WHY IT'S NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The documentation explicitly states this should work
   - This is not requesting new functionality
   - The function is supposed to already support this

   VERDICT: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation could be updated to reflect actual behavior
   - Could add a caveat about floating-point precision limits
   - The guarantee might be too strong for what's practically achievable

   WHY IT'S NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documented behavior is reasonable and achievable
   - The fix to make code match documentation is straightforward
   - The documentation example with [0.01999, 0.02001] suggests this level of precision was intended
   - Changing documentation would be a breaking change to the API contract

   VERDICT: POSSIBLE but unlikely - fixing code is better than weakening guarantee

5. BUG (Valid bug report):
   WHY IT IS A BUG:
   - Clear violation of documented behavior
   - The docstring explicitly guarantees uniqueness preservation
   - The implementation uses np.isclose with tolerances that violate this guarantee
   - The bug is reproducible and consistent
   - The root cause is identified (line 1594 using np.isclose with default tolerances)
   - The fix is straightforward and doesn't break other functionality

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE A BUG:
   - Could argue floating-point precision limits make perfect uniqueness impossible
   - However, the documentation should then reflect these limitations

   VERDICT: MOST LIKELY A BUG

FINAL ANALYSIS:
This is a clear case of code not matching its documented behavior. The function promises to preserve uniqueness between different percentile values, but fails to do so when values differ by less than np.isclose's default tolerances (rtol=1e-05, atol=1e-08). The bug report correctly identifies both the issue and its root cause. The suggested fix is reasonable and would make the implementation match the documentation.
