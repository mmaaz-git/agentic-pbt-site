## Bug Report Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Strong evidence for BUG:**
- The code explicitly guarantees "median should always be included" via code comment and implementation
- The function accepts values in [0, 1] range per its contract, and 5e-324 is technically valid
- The output produces malformed 'nan%' labels instead of proper formatting
- The median (50%) is missing from output, violating the documented invariant
- The numerical overflow causes incorrect behavior for valid inputs

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The code explicitly states the median should always be included
- The input value (5e-324) is technically within the valid range [0, 1]
- The function should handle edge cases gracefully, not produce malformed output

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- The value 5e-324 is an extremely small denormalized float, essentially zero
- This is an obscure edge case that would rarely occur in practice
- Most users would never encounter this issue with realistic percentile values

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The function produces malformed output ('nan%' labels) which is clearly wrong
- The documented invariant about median inclusion is violated
- The fix is relatively simple (bounding the precision calculation)

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not requesting new functionality
- The function already claims to handle percentiles in [0, 1]
- The median inclusion is an existing guarantee being violated

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior (producing 'nan%' and missing median) is clearly incorrect
- The documentation correctly describes what should happen
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue

### Conclusion:
This is most likely either a **BUG** or **WONTFIX** depending on whether extreme denormalized floats are considered worth fixing.

The strongest argument for BUG is that:
1. The function produces clearly malformed output ('nan%' labels)
2. It violates an explicit code invariant about median inclusion
3. The input is technically valid per the function's contract

The argument for WONTFIX would be that 5e-324 is such an extreme edge case (smallest positive float64) that it's not worth fixing. However, the malformed output suggests this should be handled properly even if rare.
