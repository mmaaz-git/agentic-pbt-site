DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. Built-in documentation (docstring):
   The density property has a simple docstring that states:
   "The percent of non- fill_value points, as decimal."

   Example provided shows:
   >>> s = SparseArray([0, 0, 1, 1, 1], fill_value=0)
   >>> s.density
   0.6

2. Documentation gaps:
   - No specification for edge cases (empty arrays, all-sparse arrays)
   - No mention of what happens when length is 0
   - No specification of error conditions or exceptions
   - The documentation only provides a single example with a non-empty array

3. Semantic expectation:
   - "Density" is defined as "percent of non-fill_value points"
   - For an empty array, this has two reasonable interpretations:
     a) 0.0 - there are 0 non-fill_value points out of 0 total (0/0 â†’ 0)
     b) NaN - the density is undefined for an empty set
   - The current implementation doesn't handle this case at all

4. API consistency:
   - Creating empty SparseArrays is valid (no errors on creation)
   - Other properties work fine on empty arrays (len, nbytes, etc.)
   - It's reasonable to expect all public properties to work without crashing

5. Conclusion:
   The documentation doesn't explicitly specify behavior for empty arrays, but:
   - A public property should not crash with an unhandled exception
   - The semantic meaning of "density" for empty arrays is reasonable (0.0 or NaN)
   - The lack of documentation doesn't excuse a ZeroDivisionError on property access
