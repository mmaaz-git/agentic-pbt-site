## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported about `pandas.api.typing.NaTType` constructor inconsistency.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The hypothesis test failed as expected with the assertion error: "NaTType() should return pd.NaT singleton for consistency"
   - This confirms that `NaTType()` does not return the singleton `pd.NaT`

2. **Manual Reproduction**:
   - `NaTType() is NaTType()`: False (each call creates a new instance)
   - `NaTType() is pd.NaT`: False (instances are not the singleton)
   - `NAType() is NAType()`: True (correctly returns singleton)
   - `NAType() is pd.NA`: True (correctly returns pd.NA singleton)

3. **Additional Testing**:
   - `pd.NaT is pd.NaT`: True (pd.NaT itself is a singleton)
   - Both `pd.NaT` and `NaTType()` instances are of type `<class 'pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype.NaTType'>`
   - Both are instances of the NaTType class
   - The key difference is that `pd.NaT` is a pre-existing singleton instance, while `NaTType()` creates new instances

### Key Findings

The bug is confirmed and reproducible:
- `pandas.api.typing.NaTType()` constructor creates new instances instead of returning the singleton `pd.NaT`
- This is inconsistent with `pandas.api.typing.NAType()` which correctly returns the singleton `pd.NA`
- The issue is that while `pd.NaT` is correctly a singleton, the `NaTType` constructor doesn't return it

This inconsistency violates the principle of least surprise, as users would expect similar behavior between `NAType()` and `NaTType()` constructors when both are exposed in the same `pandas.api.typing` module.
