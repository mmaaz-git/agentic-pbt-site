## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The tests confirm:

1. **When `name` is implemented as a property**:
   - Accessing `instance.name` correctly returns the string value ("my_custom_dtype")
   - Accessing `Class.name` returns a property object (not a string)
   - `construct_from_string()` fails with AssertionError: `(<class 'PropertyNameDtype'>, <class 'property'>)`
   - The assertion at line 289 in base.py fails because `cls.name` is a property object, not a string

2. **When `name` is implemented as a class attribute**:
   - Both `instance.name` and `Class.name` return the string value
   - `construct_from_string()` works correctly
   - Returns a proper instance of the ExtensionDtype subclass

3. **Technical Details**:
   - The bug occurs exactly as described in the report
   - The assertion `assert isinstance(cls.name, str)` at line 289 fails when name is a property
   - This is because `cls.name` on a class with a property returns the property descriptor object itself
   - To get the actual value from a property, you need an instance: `cls().name`

### Bug Validity

The bug report is technically accurate:
- The base class defines `name` as an abstract property using `@property` decorator
- Developers following this pattern naturally implement `name` as a property in subclasses
- The `construct_from_string` method fails for such implementations
- The failure is an undocumented restriction that contradicts the base class design

### Impact Assessment

- This affects any developer who follows the natural pattern suggested by the abstract property
- The workaround (using class attributes) works but contradicts the base class design pattern
- The error message (AssertionError) is not helpful for diagnosing the issue
- This is a genuine inconsistency in the pandas API design
