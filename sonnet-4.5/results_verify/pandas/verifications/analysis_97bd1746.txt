## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Analysis for Each Possible Category

#### BUG (VALID)
**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**
1. The docstring explicitly states that with `errors='ignore'`, the function should "return the module, even if the version is too old"
2. The current implementation returns None when version is too old (line 166)
3. The docstring contract is clear and unambiguous
4. This is user-facing API behavior that violates documented expectations
5. The bug affects normal usage patterns where users might want to handle version checks themselves

#### INVALID
**Why this is NOT invalid:**
- The documentation is crystal clear about expected behavior
- The test cases correctly interpret the documented contract
- This is not a misunderstanding of undefined behavior

#### WONTFIX
**Why this is NOT wontfix:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects normal usage
- The errors='ignore' parameter exists specifically for this use case
- Users rely on this behavior for graceful degradation
- The issue with sys lacking __version__ is also important for built-in modules

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why this is NOT a feature request:**
- The functionality is already documented
- This is not asking for new behavior but fixing existing documented behavior
- The docstring already promises this behavior

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why this is NOT just a documentation fix:**
- While we could change the docs to match the code, the documented behavior is more useful
- The errors='ignore' mode's purpose is to allow graceful handling
- Changing docs would break backward compatibility expectations

### Conclusion
This is a **BUG**. The implementation clearly violates the documented API contract. The function promises to return the module when errors='ignore' even if the version is too old, but instead returns None. Additionally, it raises ImportError for modules without __version__ when it should handle this gracefully in ignore mode.
