## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the findings:

### Test Results

1. **Property-based test with Hypothesis**:
   - The test fails as reported
   - With `initial_categories=['z', 'y', 'x']` and `new_categories=['a']`
   - After adding 'a' then removing it, the categories change from ['z', 'y', 'x'] to ['x', 'y', 'z']
   - This violates the round-trip property

2. **Simple reproduction case**:
   ```python
   cat = pd.Categorical([], categories=['z', 'y', 'x'])
   cat_removed = cat.remove_categories(['x'])
   ```
   - Initial categories: ['z', 'y', 'x']
   - After removing 'x': ['y', 'z'] (sorted alphabetically)
   - Expected: ['z', 'y'] (preserving original order)

3. **Behavior with ordered=True**:
   - When `ordered=True`, the method correctly preserves order
   - Removing 'x' from ['z', 'y', 'x'] gives ['z', 'y'] as expected

4. **Additional test - removing middle category**:
   - Removing 'y' from ['z', 'y', 'x'] results in ['x', 'z'] (sorted)
   - Expected: ['z', 'x'] (preserving positions)

### Source Code Analysis

The bug is exactly where the report indicates, in the source code:
```python
new_categories = (
    self.dtype.categories.difference(removals, sort=False)
    if self.dtype.ordered is True
    else self.dtype.categories.difference(removals)  # defaults to sort=True
)
```

The logic is indeed backwards:
- For ordered categoricals (ordered=True): Uses `sort=False`, preserving order
- For unordered categoricals (ordered=False): Uses default `sort=True`, alphabetically sorting

This is counterintuitive because unordered categoricals still maintain an insertion order that can be semantically meaningful, even if comparison operations don't use that order.

### Conclusion

The bug is confirmed and reproduces exactly as described in the report. The behavior is inconsistent and unexpected, where unordered categoricals have their category order changed during removal operations.
