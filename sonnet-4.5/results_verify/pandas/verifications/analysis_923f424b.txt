TRIAGE ANALYSIS

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
Arguments FOR:
- The function explicitly documents contractual guarantees that are violated
- The docstring promises uniqueness preservation and no false 0%/100% rounding
- The function produces invalid output ('nan%') which is clearly incorrect
- The failures occur with valid inputs within the documented [0,1] interval
- The issue affects data presentation accuracy, which could mislead users
- The root cause is well-identified: unbounded precision calculation causing overflow

Arguments AGAINST:
- None. The documentation is clear and the violations are unambiguous.

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/obscure issue)
Arguments FOR:
- The failing values (5e-324, 1e-45) are extremely small, near floating-point limits
- Such extreme values are unlikely in real-world percentile calculations
- Most users would never encounter these edge cases in practice
- The subnormal float 5e-324 is the smallest positive float representable

Arguments AGAINST:
- The function produces 'nan%' output, which is clearly broken
- Values like 1e-10 (not that extreme) also fail
- The function accepts the full [0,1] range, so it should handle all valid inputs
- Data analysis sometimes involves extreme values in scientific computing

3. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
Arguments FOR:
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

Arguments AGAINST:
- All test cases reproduce exactly as reported
- The documentation clearly states the expected behavior
- The violations are objective and measurable

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation should be updated)
Arguments FOR:
- Could document that extreme values near float limits may not work correctly
- Could add a note about numerical precision limitations

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation makes explicit promises that the code violates
- Changing docs to allow these failures would weaken the function's guarantees
- The issue is with the implementation, not the specification
- Users rely on the documented behavior for data presentation

5. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality needed)
Arguments FOR:
- Handling extreme subnormal floats could be seen as an enhancement

Arguments AGAINST:
- The function already claims to handle all values in [0,1]
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new capabilities
- The docstring explicitly promises this behavior already

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- The 'nan%' output is clearly a bug that produces invalid results
- The uniqueness violation breaks a core documented guarantee
- The false 0% rounding violates another core guarantee
- While the edge cases are extreme, the function should handle its documented input range

RECOMMENDATION:
This is a legitimate BUG. The function has explicit documented guarantees that it violates. The production of 'nan%' is unacceptable output. The proposed fix (capping precision at a reasonable limit) is appropriate and maintains the function's intended behavior while avoiding numerical overflow.
