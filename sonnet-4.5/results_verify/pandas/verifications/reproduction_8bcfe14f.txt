BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. VERIFICATION OF BUG LOCATION:
   - File: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/indexes/api.py
   - Function: union_indexes._find_common_index_dtype
   - Line 265: Function defined with parameter "inds"
   - Line 277: Implementation uses "indexes" instead of "inds"

2. TEST CASE EXECUTION:
   The provided test case ran successfully:
   - Created two Index objects with different dtypes (int32 and int64)
   - Called union_indexes([idx1, idx2], sort=False)
   - Result produced correct union with int64 dtype
   - The function WORKS despite the bug because it's always called with "indexes"

3. BUG CONFIRMATION:
   Source code inspection confirms:
   - Function signature: def _find_common_index_dtype(inds)
   - Implementation: dtypes = [idx.dtype for idx in indexes if isinstance(idx, Index)]
   - The parameter "inds" is never used in the function body

4. SCOPE DEMONSTRATION:
   Created demonstration showing the bug's impact:
   - When _find_common_index_dtype is called with any argument, it ignores it
   - Always uses "indexes" from the outer function's scope
   - This violates function locality principles

5. CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
   - The bug doesn't cause runtime errors currently
   - Functions correctly by accident (always called with "indexes")
   - But the code is misleading and fragile

6. TECHNICAL DETAILS CONFIRMED:
   - The bug report accurately describes the issue
   - Line numbers are correct
   - The proposed fix (change "indexes" to "inds" on line 277) would resolve it
