## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The pandas `rolling().var()` method does indeed return a negative variance value for the specific input provided.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Specific Test Case**:
   - Input: `series=[0.0, 494699.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00390625]`, `window=3`
   - At index 4, the rolling window contains: `[0.0, 0.0, 0.00390625]`
   - **Pandas result**: `-1.017252596587544e-05` (NEGATIVE)
   - **NumPy result**: `5.086263020833334e-06` (positive)
   - **Manual calculation**: `5.086263020833334e-06` (positive)

2. **Verification of the Bug**:
   - The variance returned by pandas is negative: `-1.017e-05`
   - This violates the mathematical property that variance must be non-negative
   - The correct variance (confirmed by NumPy and manual calculation) is `5.086e-06`

3. **Mathematical Validation**:
   Manual calculation shows:
   - Window data: `[0.0, 0.0, 0.00390625]`
   - Mean: `0.00130208...`
   - Squared differences: `[1.695e-06, 1.695e-06, 6.782e-06]`
   - Variance (with ddof=1): `5.086e-06`

   Since variance is the average of squared differences, it MUST be non-negative.

### Impact
This is a clear bug where pandas returns a mathematically impossible value (negative variance). The error magnitude is significant:
- Expected: `+5.086e-06`
- Actual: `-1.017e-05`
- This is not just a sign error but also differs in magnitude by a factor of ~2

The bug appears to be related to numerical stability issues when dealing with values of vastly different magnitudes (494699.5 vs 0.00390625) in the rolling window calculation.
