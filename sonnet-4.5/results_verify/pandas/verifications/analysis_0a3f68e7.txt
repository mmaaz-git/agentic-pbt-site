## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Arguments For:**
- The asymmetric behavior is clearly a bug: to_json() succeeds but read_json() fails
- Silent data corruption for int64_max+1 in 'table' orient is unacceptable
- Round-trip property violation without any documented warning
- The error message "Value is too small" is misleading and unhelpful
- pandas should handle this gracefully, either by:
  - Using Python's standard json module as fallback
  - Converting to object dtype for large integers
  - Providing clear error messages about the limitation

**Arguments Against:**
- ujson's int64 limitation is a known constraint of the underlying library
- Workarounds exist (dtype=False, using standard json)
- This affects edge cases with extremely large integers

**Verdict:** Strong case for BUG

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments For:**
- None. The bug clearly exists and is reproducible.

**Arguments Against:**
- The reproduction clearly shows the issue
- The behavior is inconsistent and problematic
- Data corruption/loss is never acceptable without warning

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments For:**
- Extremely large integers (beyond int64) are relatively rare
- ujson is a third-party dependency with known limitations
- Workarounds exist for users who need this functionality

**Arguments Against:**
- Silent data corruption is never acceptable
- The asymmetric behavior breaks reasonable expectations
- Python natively supports arbitrary precision integers
- The fix is relatively simple (fallback to standard json)

**Verdict:** Could be WONTFIX, but data corruption makes this unlikely

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments For:**
- Supporting integers beyond int64 could be seen as a new feature
- ujson was chosen for performance, not arbitrary precision
- Python's standard json module is slower but more flexible

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not a new feature - it's fixing broken round-trip behavior
- to_json() already "supports" these values by writing them
- Users expect pandas to preserve data integrity

**Verdict:** NOT a feature request - it's fixing existing broken functionality

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments For:**
- The limitation is not documented anywhere in pandas docs
- Users should be warned about int64 boundaries in JSON I/O
- The error messages could be clearer

**Arguments Against:**
- Documentation alone won't fix the silent data corruption
- The asymmetric behavior is still a bug even if documented
- Users reasonably expect round-trip to work for valid JSON

**Verdict:** Documentation should be updated, but this is primarily a BUG

### Final Assessment:
This is clearly a **BUG** because:
1. Silent data corruption occurs (int64_max+1 becomes negative)
2. Asymmetric behavior violates round-trip expectations
3. No documentation warns about these limitations
4. The error messages are misleading
5. Valid JSON is rejected by read_json()

While documentation should be improved, the core issue is a functional bug that causes data loss/corruption without warning.
