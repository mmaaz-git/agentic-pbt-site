TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The function clearly violates its documented contract by raising exceptions instead of returning bool
- The function name "is_re_compilable" implies a predicate that should return True/False, not raise exceptions
- The docstring explicitly states it returns "bool" with no mention of exceptions
- The function already handles TypeError for non-string inputs by returning False, showing the intent to handle non-compilable inputs gracefully
- Users reasonably expect to use this function to check validity before attempting to use a regex pattern
- The proposed fix is simple and consistent with the existing error handling pattern

**Strength:** VERY STRONG - This is the most likely categorization

### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue that invalid regex syntax is fundamentally different from wrong type inputs
- One might claim the function only promises to handle type errors, not syntax errors

**Strength:** VERY WEAK - The documentation makes no such distinction and explicitly promises bool return

### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Could be considered an edge case if invalid regex patterns are rare in practice
- Might argue users should validate their regex patterns before calling this function

**Strength:** WEAK - The whole purpose of this function is to check compilability; expecting pre-validation defeats its purpose

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could argue the documentation should be updated to mention it raises PatternError for invalid patterns
- The implementation could be considered correct and the documentation wrong

**Strength:** WEAK - The function name and purpose strongly suggest it should check, not propagate errors. Changing docs would make the function less useful.

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could frame handling invalid regex patterns as a new feature not originally intended
- Might argue the function was only meant to check type compatibility, not syntax validity

**Strength:** WEAK - The function name and docs clearly indicate it should check if something "can be compiled" which includes syntax validity

## Final Analysis

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function fails to fulfill its documented contract of returning a boolean value for all inputs. The function's purpose is to check whether an object can be compiled as a regex pattern - invalid syntax means it cannot be compiled, so the function should return False, not crash.

The existing implementation already demonstrates the intended pattern by catching TypeError and returning False. The omission of re.error/PatternError appears to be an oversight rather than intentional design. The fix is trivial and makes the function behavior consistent with its documentation and user expectations.

Key evidence:
1. Function promises to return bool, not raise exceptions
2. Function already handles some non-compilable cases (TypeError) by returning False
3. Function name implies a predicate check, not an operation that might fail
4. Documentation examples show returning False for non-compilable inputs
5. User expectation is to use this as a validation function before attempting regex operations
