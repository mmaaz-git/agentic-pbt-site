BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Evaluation Against Each Category:

### INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The expectation that nonzero() returns indices of elements â‰  0 is reasonable
- The method name "nonzero" has established mathematical meaning
- Consistency with NumPy arrays is a reasonable expectation

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- No explicit documentation exists for this method
- Could argue the behavior is undefined

**Verdict: NOT INVALID** - The bug violates reasonable expectations and mathematical correctness

### WONTFIX
**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects all sparse arrays with nonzero fill values
- The bug produces incorrect mathematical results (e.g., saying [0,1,2,2] has only one nonzero element)
- Users reasonably expect array-like objects to behave consistently

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- None identified

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX** - This is a significant correctness issue

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The method lacks documentation
- Could document that nonzero() means "non-fill" not "nonzero"

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current behavior is mathematically incorrect
- Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't fix the fundamental issue
- The method name "nonzero" has established meaning that shouldn't be redefined

**Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX** - The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that proper nonzero handling with nonzero fill values is a "new feature"

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The method already exists and should work correctly
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality
- Mathematical correctness is not a feature

**Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST** - This is fixing a bug in existing functionality

### BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The method returns mathematically incorrect results
- Violates the principle that arr.nonzero() should match arr.to_dense().nonzero()
- The implementation confuses "non-fill" with "nonzero"
- Affects all SparseArrays with nonzero fill values
- Clear reproducible test case
- The fix is straightforward and improves correctness

**Arguments against BUG:**
- None identified

**Verdict: THIS IS A BUG**

## Final Assessment:

This is a clear BUG in the pandas.core.arrays.sparse.SparseArray.nonzero() method. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that "nonzero" means "not equal to fill_value" when it should mean "not equal to zero". This produces mathematically incorrect results and violates user expectations for array-like behavior.

The bug is:
1. Reproducible
2. Mathematically incorrect
3. Affects a non-trivial use case
4. Has a clear fix
5. Violates reasonable expectations about array behavior
