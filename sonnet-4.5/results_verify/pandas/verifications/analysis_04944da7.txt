## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function crashes with OverflowError on technically valid SAS date values
- Pandas has established patterns for handling out-of-range dates (return NaT with errors='coerce')
- The function already handles one error case (NaN -> NaT) but not overflow
- Inconsistent with pandas conventions where invalid dates typically return NaT rather than crashing
- The crash prevents users from reading SAS files with extreme date values
- Other pandas datetime functions provide graceful error handling options

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise to handle all possible SAS date values
- Python's datetime has inherent limitations that are well-known
- The error message is accurate and descriptive ("date value out of range")

#### 2. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Dates beyond year 9999 are extremely rare in practice
- The error is a fundamental Python datetime limitation, not a pandas bug
- SAS dates representing year 10000+ are likely data errors anyway
- The overflow happens in Python's standard library, not pandas code

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (add try/except to return NaT)
- Pandas already has established patterns for handling this
- It breaks reading legitimate SAS files that happen to contain extreme dates

#### 3. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function works correctly within Python's datetime range
- The bug report has an error (claims 2936549.0 fails when it actually works)
- No documentation promises to handle dates beyond Python's limits
- OverflowError is the appropriate exception for this case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The core issue (overflow on large values) is real and reproducible
- The minor boundary error doesn't invalidate the fundamental problem
- Pandas typically handles invalid dates more gracefully

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Adding support for dates beyond year 9999 would be a new capability
- Could implement alternative representations for extreme dates
- The current behavior might be considered "working as designed"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is about error handling, not adding new functionality
- The function already returns NaT for invalid input (NaN)
- It's more about consistency with pandas conventions than new features

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function has no documentation at all
- The behavior for out-of-range dates is unspecified
- Users need to know about the year 9999 limitation
- The class docs vaguely mention "unsupported formats" without details

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The crash is still unexpected behavior regardless of documentation
- Adding documentation doesn't fix the underlying usability issue
- Other pandas functions handle this gracefully even if undocumented

### Analysis Summary

The strongest cases are:

1. **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**: The function completely lacks documentation, and the limitation should be documented regardless of whether the behavior changes.

2. **BUG**: The function's behavior is inconsistent with pandas conventions. When pandas encounters invalid/out-of-range datetime values, it typically:
   - Returns NaT when errors='coerce'
   - Provides error handling options
   - Already returns NaT for NaN input

The fact that `_parse_datetime` already returns NaT for missing values but crashes on overflow is inconsistent. The proposed fix (return NaT on overflow) aligns with existing pandas patterns and the function's own behavior for NaN input.

3. **WONTFIX**: Could argue that dates beyond 9999 are so rare that this is not worth fixing, especially since it's a Python limitation, not a pandas bug per se.
