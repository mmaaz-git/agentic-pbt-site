## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Environment:
- pandas version: 2.3.2
- Python environment: Standard installation

### Reproduction of Reported Behavior:

1. **NaTType() Instance Creation Test**:
   ```
   NaTType() is NaTType(): False
   ```
   CONFIRMED: Each call to NaTType() creates a new instance

2. **NAType() Singleton Test**:
   ```
   NAType() is NAType(): True
   ```
   CONFIRMED: NAType() returns the singleton pd.NA

3. **pd.NaT Singleton Test**:
   ```
   pd.NaT is pd.NaT: True
   ```
   CONFIRMED: pd.NaT is a singleton

4. **NaTType() vs pd.NaT Identity Test**:
   ```
   NaTType() is pd.NaT: False
   NaTType() == pd.NaT: False
   ```
   CONFIRMED: NaTType() creates instances that are neither identical to nor equal to pd.NaT

5. **Hypothesis Test**:
   The property-based test from the bug report failed as expected:
   - Test assertion: "NaTType() should always return the same singleton instance"
   - Result: AssertionError raised
   - Specific failure case (n=2): instances[0] is instances[1] = False

### Additional Observations:

1. **Type Relationships**:
   - type(pd.NaT): <class 'pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype.NaTType'>
   - type(pd.NA): <class 'pandas._libs.missing.NAType'>
   - Both pd.NaT and pd.NA are already instances of their respective types

2. **Equality Behavior**:
   - NaTType() instances are not equal to each other (nat1 == nat2: False)
   - NAType() instances have special NA equality (na1 == na2: <NA>)

3. **Class Hierarchy**:
   - NaTType inherits from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype._NaT
   - NAType inherits from pandas._libs.missing.C_NAType

### Summary:

The bug report's technical claims are accurate:
- NaTType() does create new instances on each call
- NAType() does return the singleton pd.NA
- This creates an inconsistency between the two APIs

However, the critical question is whether this behavior is actually incorrect or simply undefined, given that the documentation explicitly states these classes "should not be instantiated directly by users."
