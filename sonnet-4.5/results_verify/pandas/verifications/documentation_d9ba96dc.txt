DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing the pandas documentation for the cut() function, here are the key findings:

Official Documentation States:
-----------------------------
1. **precision parameter**: "The precision at which to store and display the bins labels."
   - Default value: 3
   - This wording is ambiguous - it says "store and display" not just "display"

2. **retbins parameter**: "Whether to return the bins or not. Useful when bins is provided as a scalar."
   - When True, returns "The computed or specified bins"
   - Documentation states this returns "an ndarray with the computed bins"

3. **Return values**: The documentation explicitly states that when retbins=True, it returns:
   - "bins : numpy.ndarray or IntervalIndex. The computed or specified bins."

Key Documentation Issues:
------------------------
1. The documentation says precision affects how bins labels are "stored and displayed" - this is ambiguous and could be interpreted as affecting the actual values (storage) or just the representation (display).

2. The documentation for retbins says it returns "The computed or specified bins" which strongly implies these are the ACTUAL bins used for categorization, not rounded versions.

3. There is NO warning or note in the documentation that the precision parameter will cause the interval boundaries to differ from the bins returned via retbins.

4. The documentation does not clarify that the interval boundaries accessible via .left and .right properties will be rounded based on precision.

Reasonable User Expectations:
-----------------------------
Based on the documentation, a reasonable user would expect:
1. retbins=True returns the actual bin edges used for categorization
2. The interval boundaries (categories[i].left/right) would match the bin edges
3. The precision parameter would only affect display/formatting, not the actual numerical values

The current behavior violates these reasonable expectations based on the documentation.
