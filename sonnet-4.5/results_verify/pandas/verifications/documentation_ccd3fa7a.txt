# Documentation Analysis for _maybe_match_name

## Function Documentation
The function's docstring states:
"""
Try to find a name to attach to the result of an operation between
a and b. If only one of these has a `name` attribute, return that
name. Otherwise return a consensus name if they match or None if
they have different names.
"""

## Key Documentation Points

1. **Purpose**: Find a consensus name for operation results
2. **Behavior when both have names**: Should return "a consensus name if they match"
3. **Return value**: name (str or None)

## Documentation Interpretation

The documentation clearly states that when both objects have a name attribute:
- If the names MATCH → return the consensus name (which would be the matching name)
- If the names DON'T MATCH → return None

The documentation does not specify:
- How to handle non-string names (like numpy arrays)
- What constitutes a "match" for complex types
- Special handling for array comparisons

## Existing Test Coverage

Looking at the test parameters in test_common.py, the existing tests cover:
- String names that match ("x" == "x")
- String names that don't match ("x" != "y")
- One object with name, one without
- NaN values as names (special case handling)

However, NO tests exist for:
- Numpy arrays as names
- Other complex objects as names

## Exception Handling Analysis

The code has specific exception handlers:
1. TypeError handler (lines 134-138): For pd.NA cases
2. ValueError handler (lines 139-141): Comment suggests it's for mismatched tuple sizes

The ValueError handler comment states: "e.g. np.int64(1) vs (np.int64(1), np.int64(2))"
This suggests it was intended to handle cases where names are tuples of different sizes.

## Documentation Conclusion

The documentation states the function should return the consensus name when names match. Two identical numpy arrays DO match (np.array_equal returns True), so by the documented behavior, the function should return the matching array, not None.

The current behavior violates the documented contract because:
1. The arrays are equal (they match)
2. The function should return the consensus name when they match
3. Instead, it returns None due to incorrect exception handling

The bug is not a documentation issue - the code fails to implement the documented behavior correctly.
