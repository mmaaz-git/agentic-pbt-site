## Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.dtypes.common.ensure_python_int

### Function Location and Visibility
The function `ensure_python_int` is located in `pandas.core.dtypes.common`, which is part of the pandas.core module. According to pandas documentation conventions, the pandas.core module is PRIVATE and not part of the public API. This function is not documented in the official pandas API reference.

### Function Docstring
The function has a clear docstring that states:

```
Ensure that a value is a python int.

Parameters
----------
value: int or numpy.integer

Returns
-------
int

Raises
------
TypeError: if the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one.
```

### Key Documentation Points
1. The function explicitly documents that it should raise `TypeError` if the value "isn't an int or can't be converted to one"
2. The parameter is expected to be an int or numpy.integer
3. The function returns a Python int

### Implementation Details from Source Code
Looking at the actual implementation (lines 109-120 of pandas/core/dtypes/common.py):
- The function catches `(TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError)` exceptions
- When any of these are caught, it re-raises them as `TypeError` with the message "Wrong type {type(value)} for value {value}"
- The exception handling does NOT include `OverflowError` in the list of caught exceptions

### Python's Built-in int() Behavior
The Python built-in `int()` function raises:
- `OverflowError` for infinity values (float('inf') and float('-inf'))
- `ValueError` for NaN values (float('nan'))

### Documentation Contract
The docstring creates a clear contract: ALL failures to convert to int should raise `TypeError`. There is no exception mentioned for special float values like infinity or NaN. The documentation does not distinguish between different types of conversion failures.
