## Documentation Analysis for SparseArray.nonzero()

### Key Findings:

1. **SparseArray.nonzero() lacks explicit documentation**
   - The method has no docstring beyond the type signature
   - pandas.arrays.SparseArray API reference doesn't document the nonzero() method behavior

2. **NumPy's nonzero() behavior is well-defined**
   - Returns tuple of arrays containing indices of non-zero elements
   - "Non-zero" means any value that evaluates to True (not equal to 0)
   - This is a fundamental NumPy operation with clear semantics

3. **SparseArray design principles from pandas documentation**
   - SparseArray is designed to be functionally similar to dense arrays
   - Documentation states: "nearly identical" behavior to dense counterparts
   - Supports NumPy ufuncs and aims for compatibility
   - Can be converted to/from NumPy arrays using numpy.asarray()

4. **Expected behavior based on NumPy compatibility**
   - Since SparseArray aims to provide "nearly identical" behavior to dense arrays
   - And since it supports NumPy operations and conversions
   - The nonzero() method should reasonably be expected to match NumPy's nonzero() behavior
   - This means returning ALL indices where values are non-zero, regardless of whether they are stored explicitly or implicitly as fill_value

### Conclusion:
While SparseArray.nonzero() lacks explicit documentation, the broader pandas sparse array documentation indicates that it should behave consistently with NumPy arrays. The current implementation violates this principle by not returning indices for non-zero fill values, making it inconsistent with NumPy's well-established nonzero() semantics.
