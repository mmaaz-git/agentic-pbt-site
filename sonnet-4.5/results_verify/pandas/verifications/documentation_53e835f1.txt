## Documentation Findings for to_numpy_dtype_inference

### Function Location
The function `to_numpy_dtype_inference` is located in `/pandas/core/arrays/_utils.py` and appears to be an internal utility function (not part of the public API).

### Documentation Status
1. **No inline documentation**: The function has no docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, or return values.
2. **Not in public API documentation**: Web searches for this function on pandas.pydata.org yield no results. This function is not documented in the public pandas documentation.
3. **Internal utility function**: The function appears to be an internal implementation detail used by pandas array implementations.

### Function Signature
```python
def to_numpy_dtype_inference(
    arr: ArrayLike, dtype: npt.DTypeLike | None, na_value, hasna: bool
) -> tuple[npt.DTypeLike, Any]:
```

### Usage Context
The function is imported and used in only two places within pandas:
1. `pandas/core/arrays/masked.py` - Used in BaseMaskedArray's to_numpy method
2. `pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py` - Used in ArrowExtensionArray's to_numpy method

### Observed Behavior from Callers
Both callers of this function explicitly handle the case where the returned dtype is None:
- In `masked.py`: After calling the function, there's an explicit check: `if dtype is None: dtype = object`
- This indicates that callers EXPECT that this function might return None as dtype

### Function Logic Analysis
The function has three main branches:
1. When `dtype is None and is_numeric_dtype(arr.dtype)`: Sets `dtype_given = False` and infers dtype
2. When `dtype is not None`: Sets `dtype_given = True` and converts to np.dtype
3. When `dtype is None and not is_numeric_dtype(arr.dtype)`: Sets `dtype_given = True` (line 44)

The variable `dtype_given` is used later (lines 58-62) to determine whether to potentially upgrade the dtype to object if it cannot hold the na_value.

### Key Observation
Since this is an internal utility function with no documentation, its intended behavior is only discernible from:
1. The implementation itself
2. How its callers use it
3. The logic of the code

The fact that callers explicitly handle `dtype=None` being returned suggests this might be expected behavior rather than a bug.
