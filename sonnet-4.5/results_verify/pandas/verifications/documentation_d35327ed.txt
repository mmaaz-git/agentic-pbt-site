## Documentation Analysis for format_percentiles

### Source Documentation
The function's docstring (lines 1549-1579 in format.py) explicitly states:

1. **Key Contract**: "Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place." (line 1565)

2. **Rounding Rules**:
   - If any two elements differ, they remain different after rounding
   - No entry is rounded to 0% or 100% (unless already equal to it)

3. **Examples Provided**:
   - [0.01999, 0.02001, 0.5, 0.666666, 0.9999] → ['1.999%', '2.001%', '50%', '66.667%', '99.99%']
   - [0, 0.5, 0.02001, 0.5, 0.666666, 0.9999] → ['0%', '50%', '2.0%', '50%', '66.67%', '99.99%']

### Interpretation of "Non-Integer"
Based on the examples and testing:
- "Integer" in this context means an integer percentage value (e.g., 0.5 = 50%, 0.25 = 25%)
- "Non-integer" means a percentage that doesn't convert to a whole number (e.g., 0.02001 = 2.001%, 0.666666 = 66.6666%)

### Documentation Clarity
The documentation is clear and unambiguous about the behavior:
- The contract explicitly states non-integers must have at least 1 decimal place
- The value 0.8899967487632947 (88.99967487632946%) is clearly a non-integer percentage
- According to the documentation, it should be formatted with at least one decimal place

### External Documentation
- No external pandas API documentation was found for this internal function
- The function is part of the internal pandas.io.formats module, not the public API
- The docstring is the authoritative source for the function's expected behavior

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly specifies that non-integer percentages should always have at least 1 decimal place. The bug report correctly identifies a violation of this documented behavior when the function formats 88.99967487632946% as "89%" without any decimal place.
