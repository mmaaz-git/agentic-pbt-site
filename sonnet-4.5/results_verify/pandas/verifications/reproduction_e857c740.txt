BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

1. Hypothesis Test Results:
---------------------------
The property-based test FAILS with the reported example:
- Input: string='0', start=1, stop=0, repl=''
- pandas result: '0'
- Expected (literal interpretation): '00'
- The test correctly identifies the discrepancy

2. Specific Test Cases from Bug Report:
----------------------------------------
Case 1: string='0', start=1, stop=0, repl=''
- pandas result: '0'
- Bug report expected: '00'
- Literal interpretation: '0'[:1] + '' + '0'[0:] = '0' + '' + '0' = '00'
- CONFIRMED: pandas does not match literal interpretation

Case 2: string='abcde', start=3, stop=1, repl='X'
- pandas result: 'abcXde'
- Bug report expected: 'abcXbcde'
- Literal interpretation: 'abcde'[:3] + 'X' + 'abcde'[1:] = 'abc' + 'X' + 'bcde' = 'abcXbcde'
- CONFIRMED: pandas does not match literal interpretation

3. Implementation Analysis:
---------------------------
Looking at pandas/core/strings/object_array.py lines 351-362:
```python
def f(x):
    if x[start:stop] == "":  # This checks if slice is empty
        local_stop = start    # If empty, use start as stop
    else:
        local_stop = stop
    y = ""
    if start is not None:
        y += x[:start]
    y += repl
    if stop is not None:
        y += x[local_stop:]  # Uses local_stop, not stop
    return y
```

When start > stop:
- x[start:stop] evaluates to "" (empty string)
- The code sets local_stop = start
- Result becomes: x[:start] + repl + x[start:]
- This is insertion at position start, not literal slice replacement

4. Arrow Implementation Behavior:
---------------------------------
PyArrow's utf8_replace_slice shows IDENTICAL behavior:
- When start > stop, it also treats it as insertion at start
- This suggests PyArrow internally normalizes inverted indices
- Both implementations are CONSISTENT with each other

5. Technical Correctness of Bug Report:
---------------------------------------
The bug report correctly:
- Identifies the discrepancy between current behavior and literal interpretation
- Provides working reproduction code
- Shows the exact line of code causing the special case handling
- Demonstrates that the behavior differs from string[:start] + repl + string[stop:]

6. Python Slicing Behavior:
---------------------------
In Python:
- 'abcde'[3:1] returns '' (empty string)
- This is well-defined behavior for inverted slices
- The literal formula string[:start] + repl + string[stop:] is mathematically consistent for ALL start/stop values

SUMMARY:
The bug report is TECHNICALLY CORRECT. The current implementation does NOT follow the literal interpretation of slice replacement when start > stop. Instead, both pandas and PyArrow normalize the indices to treat it as an insertion at position start.
