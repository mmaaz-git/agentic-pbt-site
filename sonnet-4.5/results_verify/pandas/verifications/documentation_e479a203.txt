DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Pandas Documentation Review:

1. DataFrame.to_json():
   - The double_precision parameter defaults to 10 decimal places
   - Maximum allowed precision is 15 (hardcoded limit)
   - No explicit guarantees about round-trip preservation
   - No warnings about potential precision loss for extreme values

2. pandas.read_json():
   - Has a precise_float parameter (default False) for higher precision parsing
   - Default uses "fast but less precise builtin functionality"
   - No documentation about handling of values near float64 limits
   - No warnings about potential conversion to infinity

3. JSON Specification (RFC 7159):
   - Recommends implementations align with IEEE 754-2008 binary64 (double precision)
   - States: "Implementations MAY set limits on the range and precision of numbers"
   - Explicitly prohibits Infinity and NaN in JSON
   - Notes that numbers with extreme precision "may indicate potential interoperability problems"
   - Advises implementations should expect "no more precision or range than" IEEE 754 double provides

Key Documentation Gaps:
1. Pandas documentation does not warn users that values near float64 limits may not round-trip correctly
2. The interaction between double_precision truncation and float64 limits is not documented
3. There's no mention that the default precision of 10 is insufficient for preserving extreme float64 values
4. The documentation doesn't specify what happens when a parsed value exceeds float64 range

The documentation does not make explicit guarantees about round-trip preservation, particularly for extreme values. However, it also doesn't warn users about this limitation, which could be considered a documentation gap.
