Bug Report Triage Analysis
===========================

Considering each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
   Arguments against:
   - The bug is real and reproducible
   - Documentation clearly states TypeError should be raised
   - Function actually raises ValueError for certain inputs
   - Not a case of overly pedantic exception type checking - the documentation explicitly promises TypeError

   Arguments for:
   - None - the report accurately describes a real issue

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
   Arguments against:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - simple strings like '0:' trigger it
   - Exception handling is fundamental to API contracts
   - Users rely on documented exception types for error handling
   - The fix is straightforward and low risk

   Arguments for:
   - Could argue that catching either ValueError or TypeError works in practice
   - However, this breaks the documented API contract which is important

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
   Arguments against:
   - The documentation already promises TypeError for all invalid inputs
   - This is not asking for new functionality
   - The function already normalizes some exceptions (SyntaxError -> TypeError)

   Arguments for:
   - None - this is about fixing existing behavior, not adding new features

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Docs are wrong)
   Arguments against:
   - The documented behavior (raising TypeError) is the sensible and expected behavior
   - The function already shows intent to normalize exceptions (SyntaxError handling)
   - Changing docs to say "raises TypeError or ValueError" would be worse API design

   Arguments for:
   - Could update docs to reflect current behavior
   - However, fixing the code is better than degrading the API contract

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments for:
   - Clear violation of documented API contract
   - Inconsistent exception behavior for similar invalid inputs
   - Makes error handling unpredictable for library users
   - The function already demonstrates intent to normalize exceptions
   - Fix is straightforward - catch ValueError and convert to TypeError
   - This is exactly what the proposed fix does

   Arguments against:
   - None - this is a clear bug

Additional Considerations:
- The existing code already catches SyntaxError and converts it to TypeError
- This shows clear intent to provide consistent TypeError for all invalid inputs
- The omission of ValueError handling appears to be an oversight
- The proposed fix is minimal and follows the existing pattern in the code
