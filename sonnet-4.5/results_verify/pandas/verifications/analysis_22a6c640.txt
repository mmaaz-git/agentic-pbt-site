## Analysis of Bug Report Categories

### BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)

**Arguments for BUG:**
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: The function treats None differently for floats vs integers with `skipna=True`
   - Floats with None: returns `'mixed-integer-float'` (None NOT ignored)
   - Integers with None: returns `'integer'` (None IS ignored)

2. **Violates pandas conventions**: Throughout pandas, None and NaN are both treated as missing values. Functions with `skipna` parameters typically handle both equivalently.

3. **Inconsistent with NaN handling**: The same function correctly ignores NaN values for floats when `skipna=True`, but fails to ignore None values.

4. **User expectation mismatch**: Users would reasonably expect `skipna=True` to skip all missing values (both None and NaN), not just NaN.

5. **Real impact**: This inconsistency can cause incorrect downstream logic where code expects consistent type inference when missing values are ignored.

### INVALID (Incorrect report)

**Arguments against (weak):**
1. The documentation literally says "Ignore NaN values" not "Ignore None values"
2. The behavior is consistent - it always returns `'mixed-integer-float'` for floats with None

**Counter-arguments:**
- The literal documentation interpretation is overly pedantic given pandas' general missing value handling
- Consistency in wrong behavior doesn't make it correct

### WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)

**Arguments against:**
- This is not trivial - type inference is fundamental to many pandas operations
- The inconsistency affects real-world data processing pipelines

### FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)

**Arguments against:**
- This is not requesting new functionality but reporting broken existing functionality
- The `skipna` parameter already exists and should work consistently

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)

**Possible argument:**
- The documentation could be clearer about None vs NaN handling

**Counter-argument:**
- The code behavior is clearly inconsistent and buggy, not just poorly documented
- Even if documentation were updated to say "only ignores NaN, not None", the inconsistency between float and integer handling would still be a bug

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function exhibits inconsistent behavior that violates pandas' general principles of missing value handling. The fact that:
1. Integers with None work correctly with `skipna=True`
2. Floats with NaN work correctly with `skipna=True`
3. But floats with None do NOT work correctly with `skipna=True`

...demonstrates this is an implementation bug, not a documentation issue or feature request. The behavior is internally inconsistent and externally inconsistent with pandas conventions.
