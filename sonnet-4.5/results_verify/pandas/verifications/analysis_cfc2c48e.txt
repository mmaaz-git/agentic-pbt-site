BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

Analyzing the bug report against the five possible categories:

1. BUG (Valid Bug)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - The function explicitly documents that it raises ImportError for import-related issues
   - The actual behavior (raising KeyError) violates this documented API contract
   - This is not an edge case about "which type of error is better" - the documentation promises ImportError
   - The error type matters for exception handling - code catching ImportError will miss KeyError
   - The fix is straightforward and maintains backward compatibility
   - This is a legitimate edge case that could occur in real-world usage

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - This is a rare edge case (submodule in sys.modules without parent module)
   - The existing test suite didn't cover this case, suggesting it wasn't considered important

2. INVALID
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - None - the documentation clearly states ImportError should be raised

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - This is not about raising a less descriptive exception - it's raising the wrong exception type
   - The documentation explicitly promises ImportError, not just "some exception"

3. WONTFIX
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - This is an obscure edge case that might rarely happen in practice
   - Normal imports would typically have the parent module in sys.modules

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The fix is trivial (3-4 lines of code)
   - It's not about internal implementation details but a public API
   - The error type matters for proper exception handling

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - One could argue the documentation should mention this KeyError edge case

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The documentation is clear: ImportError should be raised for import issues
   - The code should be fixed to match the documentation, not vice versa
   - Changing documentation to allow KeyError would break backward compatibility

5. FEATURE_REQUEST
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - None - the function already claims to handle this case

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - This isn't asking for new functionality but fixing existing broken behavior
   - The function already handles submodules, just incorrectly in this edge case

CONCLUSION:
----------
This is clearly a BUG. The function has a documented contract to raise ImportError for import-related issues, but instead raises KeyError in a specific edge case. The bug is reproducible, the fix is straightforward, and the current behavior violates the API contract that users rely on for exception handling.
