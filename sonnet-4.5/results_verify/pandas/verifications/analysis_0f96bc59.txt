ANALYSIS FOR BUG TRIAGE

CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH CATEGORY:

1. BUG - Valid bug that should be fixed
   Arguments FOR:
   - The code crashes with an OverflowError for extremely large negative values, which is a crash bug
   - The code produces mathematically invalid window bounds (start > end) for negative window_size
   - The class name "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" semantically implies forward-looking windows, which negative sizes violate
   - The proposed fix (adding validation) is reasonable and prevents both issues
   - Window bounds should maintain the invariant that start[i] <= end[i] for correct operation

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit negative values
   - The crash only happens with extremely large values unlikely in real use

2. INVALID - Report is incorrect
   Arguments FOR:
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly say negative values are prohibited
   - The parameter type is just 'int', not 'positive int' or 'non-negative int'

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug is real and reproducible - the code does crash and produce invalid results
   - The semantic meaning of "Forward" in the class name implies non-negative values
   - The invariant violation (start > end) is clearly incorrect behavior

3. WONTFIX - Bug exists but too trivial
   Arguments FOR:
   - Negative window sizes make no semantic sense for a "Forward" window indexer
   - Users would never intentionally use negative values for forward-looking windows
   - The extremely large negative value causing overflow is an edge case unlikely to occur
   - This is a misuse of the API rather than a legitimate use case

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code should not crash with an OverflowError - it should handle invalid input gracefully
   - Input validation is a basic requirement for robust APIs
   - The fix is simple and improves code robustness

4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Not a bug but a new feature
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue that input validation is a new feature being requested
   - The current code works as designed for positive values

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is fixing broken behavior (crashes and invalid results), not adding new functionality
   - Input validation for preventing crashes is bug fixing, not a feature

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Documentation issue
   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation could be clearer about valid window_size values
   - Could update docs to explicitly state window_size must be non-negative

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code behavior is incorrect (crashes and invalid results), not just poorly documented
   - Even with better documentation, the code should not crash with an OverflowError
   - The semantic meaning is already clear from the class name

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a BUG. While negative values don't make semantic sense for a forward-looking window, the code should handle invalid input gracefully rather than:
1. Crashing with an OverflowError
2. Producing mathematically invalid window bounds where start > end

The proposed fix correctly adds input validation to prevent both issues. This improves the robustness of the API and provides a clear error message to users who accidentally provide negative values.
