Documentation Analysis
=====================

1. Public API Status:
   - is_subperiod and is_superperiod ARE exported functions in pandas.tseries.frequencies
   - They appear in __all__ list: ['Day', 'get_period_alias', 'infer_freq', 'is_subperiod', 'is_superperiod', 'to_offset']
   - They are part of the public API in pandas 2.3.2

2. Function Documentation (from source code):
   - is_subperiod: "Returns True if downsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"
   - is_superperiod: "Returns True if upsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"

3. Semantic Meaning:
   - Downsampling: Converting from higher frequency to lower (e.g., Daily to Monthly)
   - Upsampling: Converting from lower frequency to higher (e.g., Monthly to Daily)
   - These are conceptually inverse operations

4. External Documentation:
   - No specific documentation found in pandas official docs for these functions
   - General resampling documentation exists but doesn't mention these specific functions
   - Functions appear to be utility functions not widely documented

5. Expected Behavior Based on Logic:
   - If is_subperiod(A, B) is true, then is_superperiod(B, A) should be true
   - This is the inverse relationship property
   - A frequency should logically be both a subperiod and superperiod of itself (identity property)

6. Current Behavior Patterns:
   - Some frequencies (D, h, W) correctly return same value for self-relationship
   - Others (M, Q) return False for both (consistent but arguably wrong)
   - Y returns different values (False for subperiod, True for superperiod) - INCONSISTENT

7. No Documentation Specifying:
   - Whether the inverse relationship should hold
   - Whether a frequency should be a sub/superperiod of itself
   - Special cases for annual frequencies

CONCLUSION: The documentation is insufficient to determine the intended behavior, but the
inconsistency for annual frequencies violates basic logical properties that reasonable users
would expect from inverse operations.
