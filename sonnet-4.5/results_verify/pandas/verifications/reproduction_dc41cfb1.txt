=== BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT ===

1. BUG REPRODUCTION STATUS: CONFIRMED

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
- The provided Hypothesis test successfully failed when run, confirming negative variances
- The specific failing input (data=[3222872787.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0], window=3) was verified
- Additional failing cases were found by Hypothesis, confirming this is not an isolated incident

3. SPECIFIC EXAMPLE REPRODUCTION:
Input: data = [3222872787.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0], window = 3
Output from pandas.rolling(3).var():
  - Index 0: NaN (expected, insufficient data)
  - Index 1: NaN (expected, insufficient data)
  - Index 2: 3.462303e+18 (window=[3222872787.0, 0.0, 2.0])
  - Index 3: -511.666667 (window=[0.0, 2.0, 0.0]) ← NEGATIVE VARIANCE

4. MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION:
For window [0.0, 2.0, 0.0]:
- Mean = (0 + 2 + 0) / 3 = 0.666667
- Deviations: [-0.667, 1.333, -0.667]
- Squared deviations: [0.444, 1.778, 0.444]
- Sum of squared deviations: 2.667
- Variance (ddof=1) = 2.667 / 2 = 1.333

EXPECTED: 1.333 (positive)
ACTUAL: -511.667 (negative)

5. CROSS-VERIFICATION:
- NumPy: np.var([0.0, 2.0, 0.0], ddof=1) = 1.333 ✓
- Manual calculation: 1.333 ✓
- Pandas rolling: -511.667 ✗

6. ROOT CAUSE INDICATORS:
The bug occurs when:
- Large values (3.2 billion) are in the rolling window initially
- Window transitions to contain only small values
- This pattern suggests numerical instability in the variance algorithm
- Likely using the computationally unstable formula: Var(X) = E[X²] - E[X]²

7. IMPACT:
- Variance is mathematically ALWAYS non-negative (sum of squares divided by count)
- Negative variance is mathematically impossible and violates fundamental statistical properties
- This can corrupt downstream analyses that assume valid variance values
- Silent data corruption: no error or warning is raised

CONCLUSION: The bug is successfully reproduced. Pandas rolling.var() returns mathematically impossible negative values, confirming the reported issue.
