Documentation Analysis
======================

After reviewing the pandas documentation for read_excel and to_excel, here are the key findings:

read_excel Documentation:
-------------------------
1. **NA Value Handling**:
   - By default, read_excel recognizes multiple strings as NA/NaN, including empty strings (''), '#N/A', 'NA', 'NaN', 'null', etc.
   - The na_filter parameter (default True) enables detection of missing value markers
   - When na_filter=False, no strings are parsed as NA

2. **Empty Cell Behavior**:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly state that rows with all NA values will be dropped
   - The documentation does NOT provide guarantees about data preservation or round-trip behavior
   - There is no mention of special behavior for rows containing only empty/NA values

to_excel Documentation:
-----------------------
1. **Missing Data Representation**:
   - The na_rep parameter (default '') specifies how to represent missing data in Excel
   - By default, missing values are written as empty strings to Excel files

2. **Round-Trip Guarantees**:
   - The documentation does NOT provide any explicit guarantees about round-trip data preservation
   - No mention of how empty strings vs None values are differentiated when writing

General Excel I/O Documentation:
--------------------------------
1. The pandas user guide for Excel I/O does not provide specific information about:
   - Round-trip guarantees for data preservation
   - Behavior when all cells in a row are empty/NA
   - Differences between empty cells and cells with empty strings

Community Issues and Discussions:
----------------------------------
1. GitHub Issue #20377 discusses similar issues with empty cells being converted to 'nan' strings
2. Multiple Stack Overflow posts discuss data loss and preservation issues with Excel round-trips
3. The community recognizes these as known issues, with various workarounds suggested

Critical Documentation Gaps:
----------------------------
1. No explicit documentation that rows with all NA/empty values might be dropped
2. No warning about potential data loss during round-trips
3. No specification of expected behavior for edge cases (all-empty rows)
4. No distinction made between "empty cell" and "cell with empty string" in Excel context

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation does NOT specify that rows with all empty/NA values should be dropped during Excel round-trips. This behavior appears to be undocumented, making it either:
- An undocumented "feature" that should be documented
- A bug that violates reasonable expectations of data preservation

The lack of explicit round-trip guarantees in the documentation suggests this is an area where pandas' behavior is not well-defined or guaranteed.
