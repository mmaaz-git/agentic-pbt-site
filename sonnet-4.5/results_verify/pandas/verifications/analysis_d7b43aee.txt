# Triage Analysis for union_indexes Bug Report

## Consideration for Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments For:**
- The function exhibits inconsistent behavior: removes duplicates when indexes differ but preserves them when equal
- The internal `_unique_indices` function explicitly states it "removes duplicates", indicating this is the intended behavior
- The optimization at line 318 creates an unintended side effect that violates the function's implicit contract
- The bug report correctly identifies the root cause and provides a reasonable fix
- The inconsistency is not trivial - it affects the correctness of the union operation

**Arguments Against:**
- The function mimics `Index.union()` behavior when indexes are equal (both preserve duplicates)
- It's an internal function, not public API, so behavior might be intentionally flexible

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- `union_indexes` is an internal function, not public API
- When indexes are equal, it behaves like `Index.union()` which intentionally preserves duplicates
- No explicit documentation promises unique values

**Arguments Against:**
- The function's behavior is inconsistent within itself (different behavior for equal vs different indexes)
- The `_unique_indices` helper clearly indicates the intent to remove duplicates
- The inconsistency appears to be an unintended optimization side effect, not deliberate design

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- It's an internal function with limited impact
- The behavior matches `Index.union()` in the specific case (equal indexes)
- Fixing it might break existing code that depends on this behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- The inconsistency is significant and could lead to subtle bugs
- The fix is simple and localized
- The function name implies set union semantics (unique values)

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be viewed as requesting consistent behavior rather than fixing a bug
- The function works, just not as the reporter expects

**Arguments Against:**
- This is clearly a bug (inconsistent behavior), not a missing feature
- The code structure shows removing duplicates was the original intent

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The function lacks clear documentation about duplicate handling
- Could document the current behavior as intentional

**Arguments Against:**
- The inconsistent behavior itself is the problem, not just missing documentation
- Documenting inconsistent behavior doesn't make it correct

## Analysis Conclusion

The most compelling evidence:

1. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The function removes duplicates when indexes differ but preserves them when equal. This inconsistency is the strongest indicator of a bug.

2. **Clear Intent in Code**: The `_unique_indices` function explicitly documents that it "removes duplicates", and this function is called in all cases except when indexes are equal.

3. **Optimization Side Effect**: The code structure strongly suggests the current behavior is an unintended side effect of an optimization (skipping `_unique_indices` when indexes are equal).

4. **Simple Fix**: The proposed fix is minimal and logical - ensuring duplicates are removed even when the optimization path is taken.

This is a **BUG**. The function exhibits inconsistent behavior that appears to be an unintended consequence of an optimization. The intent to remove duplicates is clear from the code structure and the `_unique_indices` documentation.
