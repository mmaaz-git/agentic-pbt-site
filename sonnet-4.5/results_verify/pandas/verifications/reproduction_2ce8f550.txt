REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and occurs exactly as described.

Test Results:
-------------
1. Hypothesis Test: FAILED
   - The test with input ['', '\x00'] fails with: "Mismatch at index 1: '\x00' != ''"
   - This confirms the round-trip property is violated

2. Manual Reproduction: CONFIRMED
   - Input: ['', '\x00']
   - Codes returned: [0, 0] (both values get the same code)
   - Uniques returned: [''] (only contains empty string)
   - Reconstructed via uniques.take(codes): ['', '']
   - The null character '\x00' is lost in the reconstruction

Key Observations:
-----------------
1. Both the empty string '' and the null character '\x00' are assigned the same code (0)
2. The uniques array only contains the empty string, not the null character
3. When reconstructing via uniques.take(codes), we get ['', ''] instead of ['', '\x00']
4. This violates the documented guarantee that "uniques.take(codes) will have the same values as values"

The Effect:
-----------
This is a data integrity issue where distinct string values (empty string vs null character) are incorrectly treated as identical. This causes:
- Loss of data when round-tripping through factorize
- Incorrect deduplication where '\x00' and '' are treated as the same value
- Violation of the documented contract of the factorize function

The bug report's code examples run correctly and produce the exact output shown in the report.
