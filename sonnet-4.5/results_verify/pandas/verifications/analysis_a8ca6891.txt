## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Why this IS a bug:**
1. **Clear implementation error**: Line 1550 has an obvious coding mistake that creates infinite recursion
2. **Violates documented behavior**: Documentation promises to return a SparseArray, but instead crashes with RecursionError
3. **Common use case failure**: Using fill_value=0 is extremely common for sparse arrays (representing sparse matrices with zero as the default)
4. **Simple, correct fix available**: The fix is trivial - change `SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()` to `SparseArray(self.to_dense().cumsum())`
5. **Property-based test confirms**: The test correctly identifies that sparse cumsum should match dense cumsum
6. **100% reproducible**: Every single input with non-null fill_value triggers the bug

**This is the most likely categorization** - It's a clear programming error with an obvious fix.

### Considering INVALID

**Why this might be invalid:**
- None. The bug is real, reproducible, and violates documented behavior.

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID - The bug report is accurate and well-documented.

### Considering WONTFIX

**Why this might be WONTFIX:**
- Could argue users should use null fill values for sparse arrays
- Might claim this is an edge case

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
1. Non-null fill values (especially 0) are fundamental to sparse array usage
2. This breaks core functionality, not an obscure edge case
3. The fix is trivial (one-line change)
4. High severity - causes complete failure, not just suboptimal behavior

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX - This is critical functionality that must work.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why this might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could argue the documentation should specify limitations on fill_value

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code is clearly wrong (infinite recursion is never intended)
2. The intent is obvious from context - cumsum should work for all sparse arrays
3. Changing docs to say "doesn't work with fill_value=0" would be absurd

**Verdict:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code is broken, not the documentation.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why this might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could claim cumsum for non-null fill values was never implemented

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. The code attempts to handle this case (line 1549-1550)
2. It's trying to implement the feature but has a bug
3. cumsum is a basic array operation that should work for all valid arrays
4. The implementation exists but is broken

**Verdict:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - The feature exists but has a bug.

## Final Assessment

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The code has a clear programming error that causes infinite recursion where the developer obviously intended to compute cumulative sum. The fix is trivial and correct. The bug breaks fundamental functionality for a common use case (sparse arrays with fill_value=0).
