## Reproduction of Bug Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in the pandas codebase.

### Verification of Code Structure

The file `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/compat/numpy/function.py` contains the following code at lines 136-141:

```python
ARGSORT_DEFAULTS: dict[str, int | str | None] = {}
ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["axis"] = -1
ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["kind"] = "quicksort"  # Line 138
ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["order"] = None
ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["kind"] = None         # Line 140 - overwrites line 138
ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["stable"] = None
```

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The provided hypothesis test passes, confirming that `ARGSORT_DEFAULTS['kind']` is indeed `None`.

2. **Reproduction Script**: Running the reproduction code confirms:
   - `ARGSORT_DEFAULTS['kind']` evaluates to `None`
   - Line 138 sets `"kind"` to `"quicksort"`
   - Line 140 immediately overwrites it with `None`
   - This makes line 138 dead code that has no effect

### Effect of the Bug

The effect of this bug is purely code quality related:
- Line 138 is dead code that is never executed meaningfully
- The assignment at line 138 has no effect as it's immediately overwritten
- This creates confusion for maintainers about the intended value
- No runtime errors occur - the final value (`None`) appears to be the intended one

The bug report is accurate in its technical description of the issue.
