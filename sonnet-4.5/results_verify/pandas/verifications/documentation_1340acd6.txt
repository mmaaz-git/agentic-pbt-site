## Documentation Analysis for pandas.cut

### Official Documentation Review

I have reviewed the official pandas.cut documentation from multiple sources:

1. **Online Documentation (pandas.pydata.org)**
   - Describes the function as "Bin values into discrete intervals"
   - Used for converting continuous variables to categorical
   - Details parameter behavior and return types

2. **Built-in Help Documentation**
   - Confirms the same functionality
   - States: "Any NA values will be NA in the result. Out of bounds values will be NA in the resulting Series or Categorical object."

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **No mention of numerical precision limitations**
   - The documentation does not specify any limitations regarding subnormal floats
   - No warnings about minimum range requirements
   - No discussion of numerical stability issues with very small values

2. **NA Value Handling**
   - Documentation states NA values are preserved in the result
   - Out-of-bounds values become NA
   - However, it does NOT mention that numerical precision issues can cause all values to become NA

3. **Range Extension Behavior**
   - For integer bins, the documentation states: "The range of x is extended by .1% on each side"
   - This extension mechanism appears to fail with subnormal values

4. **Error Handling**
   - Documentation mentions raising ValueError for non-unique bins
   - No mention of errors related to numerical precision or subnormal values
   - The confusing error message about "missing values must be missing in the same location" is not documented

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation fails to address:
1. Behavior with subnormal floating-point values
2. Minimum range requirements for successful binning
3. Numerical stability limitations
4. The fact that very small ranges can result in all NaN outputs
5. Specific error messages that can occur with edge cases

### Conclusion

The documentation does not specify that pandas.cut should handle all valid floating-point values, nor does it warn about limitations with subnormal values. The silent failure to all-NaN values contradicts the reasonable expectation that the function should either:
- Successfully bin any valid float data, or
- Raise a clear error explaining the limitation

The current behavior (silent NaN conversion) is undocumented and unexpected based on the provided documentation.
