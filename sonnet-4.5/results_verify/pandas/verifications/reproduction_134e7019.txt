## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The provided Hypothesis test failed as expected with the exact input mentioned in the bug report:
- Input: `target_list=[], slice_start=None, slice_stop=-1, slice_step=None`
- Expected length: 0 (the actual length of `[][:−1]`)
- Computed length: -1 (incorrectly returned by `length_of_indexer`)

### Manual Reproduction
The manual reproduction code confirms the bug:
- For `target=[]` and `indexer=slice(None, -1, None)`:
  - Python's built-in slicing: `len([][:-1]) = 0`
  - `length_of_indexer` function: returns `-1`

### Pattern Analysis
Additional test cases reveal a clear pattern:
1. Empty list with negative stop indices always returns negative values:
   - `[][:−1]` → actual=0, computed=-1
   - `[][:−2]` → actual=0, computed=-2

2. When the list is too small for the negative index:
   - `[1][:−2]` → actual=0, computed=-1 (list has 1 element, -2 would be before start)
   - `[1,2][:−3]` → actual=0, computed=-1 (list has 2 elements, -3 would be before start)

3. When the list is large enough for the negative index, it works correctly:
   - `[1][:−1]` → actual=0, computed=0 ✓
   - `[1,2][:−1]` → actual=1, computed=1 ✓
   - `[1,2][:−2]` → actual=0, computed=0 ✓

### Root Cause
The bug occurs when converting negative indices to positive indices. When `stop` is negative and `|stop| > len(target)`, the conversion `stop + target_len` results in a negative number, which is then incorrectly returned as the slice length.

For example, with `target=[]` and `stop=-1`:
- `stop + target_len = -1 + 0 = -1`
- This negative value is used in length calculation, resulting in negative length

The bug report accurately describes this issue and the proposed fix (clamping to 0) appears correct.
