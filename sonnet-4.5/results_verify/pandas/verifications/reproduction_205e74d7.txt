BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

## Test Setup:
I successfully reproduced the reported bug using the provided test case and additional edge cases.

## Reproduction Results:

### 1. Main Test Case (from bug report):
**Input:** `series = pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]), lag = 10`
**Expected (per bug report):** Should raise ValueError
**Actual behavior:** Function returns successfully, creates empty scatter plot with 0 data points

✓ CONFIRMED: The function does NOT raise an error as the bug report claims it should.
✓ CONFIRMED: The resulting plot is empty (0 data points).

### 2. Internal Behavior Verification:
When lag=10 and len(series)=5:
- `y1 = data[:-10]` produces empty array `[]`
- `y2 = data[10:]` produces empty array `[]`
- `ax.scatter([], [])` creates a valid but empty scatter plot

This matches exactly what the bug report describes.

### 3. Edge Cases Tested:

| lag value | len(series) | Result                                  |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0         | 5           | ValueError: x and y must be same size |
| 1         | 5           | Valid plot with 4 points              |
| 4         | 5           | Valid plot with 1 point               |
| 5         | 5           | Empty plot with 0 points (no error)   |
| 6         | 5           | Empty plot with 0 points (no error)   |
| 10        | 5           | Empty plot with 0 points (no error)   |
| -1        | 5           | Plot with 1 point (unexpected)        |

### 4. Technical Accuracy of Bug Report:
✓ The code examples in the bug report run correctly
✓ The hypothesis test accurately demonstrates the issue
✓ The description of internal implementation (`data[:-lag]` and `data[lag:]`) is correct
✓ The claim that empty arrays produce empty plots is verified

### 5. Meaningfulness of Output:
The bug report correctly identifies that:
- A lag plot with lag >= len(series) is mathematically meaningless
- The empty plot provides no useful information about autocorrelation
- Users get no indication that their input is invalid
- The silent failure could be mistaken for data issues

## Conclusion:
The technical details in the bug report are 100% accurate. The function does silently produce empty, meaningless plots when lag >= len(series), exactly as described. The proposed fix (adding validation) would prevent this confusing behavior.
