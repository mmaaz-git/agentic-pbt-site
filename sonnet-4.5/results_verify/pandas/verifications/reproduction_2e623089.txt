Bug Reproduction Report
======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. Basic Reproduction:
   - Running `is_subperiod('Y', 'Y')` returns False
   - Running `is_superperiod('Y', 'Y')` returns True
   - These should be equal according to the inverse relationship property

2. Hypothesis Test:
   - The hypothesis-based property test fails immediately with source='Y' and target='Y'
   - The test correctly identifies the violation of the inverse relationship

3. Extended Testing:
   I tested multiple frequency pairs to understand the scope:
   - Annual frequencies (Y, Y-JAN, Y-DEC): ALL FAIL the inverse property
   - Monthly (M), Quarterly (Q): Pass (both return False for same frequency)
   - Daily (D), Weekly (W), Hourly (h): Pass (both return True for same frequency)

   This confirms the bug is specific to annual frequencies.

4. Code Analysis:
   Looking at the source code (lines 455-460 and 510-512):
   - `is_subperiod` when target is annual: Does NOT check if source is also annual,
     falls through to line 460 which doesn't include annual frequencies
   - `is_superperiod` when source is annual: DOES check if target is annual (lines 511-512),
     returns True if they have same rule month

   The asymmetry is clear: is_superperiod has special handling for annual-to-annual,
   while is_subperiod does not.

CONCLUSION: The bug is confirmed and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
