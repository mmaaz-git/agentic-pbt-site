## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Claims:
The bug report claims that `SparseArray.density` raises `ZeroDivisionError` when called on an empty array.

### Reproduction Results:
1. **The bug is CONFIRMED** - calling `density` on an empty SparseArray does raise ZeroDivisionError
2. The exact error occurs at line 708 in sparse/array.py: `return self.sp_index.npoints / self.sp_index.length`
3. For empty arrays: `sp_index.length = 0` and `sp_index.npoints = 0`, causing 0/0 division

### Test Results:
- Empty array: **ZeroDivisionError** (as reported)
- Single element array: density = 1.0 (works)
- All zeros array: density = 0.0 (works)
- No zeros array: density = 1.0 (works)
- Mixed array [0,0,1,1,1]: density = 0.6 (matches documentation example)

### Hypothesis Test:
The provided Hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue - it fails immediately on an empty array example.

### Related Behavior:
- DataFrame.sparse.density also raises ZeroDivisionError for empty DataFrames with sparse columns
- Series.sparse.density also raises ZeroDivisionError for empty Series with sparse dtype
- This suggests the issue is consistent across pandas sparse implementations

### Mathematical Context:
- Density is defined as "percent of non-fill_value points"
- For empty array: 0 non-fill values / 0 total values = 0/0 (undefined)
- NumPy handles 0/0 by returning NaN
- The current implementation doesn't handle this edge case

### Bug Report Accuracy:
The technical details in the bug report are 100% accurate:
- The error occurs exactly as described
- The failing input is correct
- The proposed fix would prevent the crash
