Documentation Findings for pandas.core.algorithms.unique
========================================================

The pandas.core.algorithms.unique function documentation states:

1. PURPOSE: "Return unique values based on a hash table"

2. KEY BEHAVIORS:
   - Uniques are returned in order of appearance
   - This does NOT sort
   - Includes NA values
   - Significantly faster than numpy.unique for long enough sequences

3. INPUT/OUTPUT:
   - Input: 1d array-like values
   - Returns: numpy.ndarray or ExtensionArray depending on input type

4. DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES:
   - Shows it works with Series containing numbers
   - Shows it works with timestamps
   - Shows it works with object arrays containing strings:
     Example: pd.unique(np.array(list("baabc"), dtype="O")) returns ['b', 'a', 'c']
   - Shows it works with tuples

5. CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
   The documentation does NOT specify any special handling or limitations for:
   - Null characters (\x00) in strings
   - Binary data in strings
   - Control characters in strings
   - Any string content restrictions

6. FUNDAMENTAL EXPECTATION:
   Based on the documentation stating it returns "unique values", the natural and obvious
   expectation is that the function should return ALL distinct values from the input.
   The documentation gives no indication that certain string values would be treated
   as equivalent when they are distinct in Python.

7. COMPARISON WITH NUMPY:
   The documentation notes it is "significantly faster than numpy.unique" but does not
   mention any behavioral differences regarding what values are considered unique.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation clearly indicates this function should return all unique/distinct values
from the input array. There is no documented exception for strings containing null bytes
or any indication that such strings would be treated specially. The fundamental purpose
of a "unique" function is to return distinct values, and Python considers '' and '\x00'
as distinct strings (they have different hashes and compare as unequal).
