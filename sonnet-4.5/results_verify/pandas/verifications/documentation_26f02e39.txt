Documentation Analysis for pandas.read_clipboard()

Official Documentation Findings:

1. The pandas.read_clipboard() function documentation states:
   - It reads text from the system clipboard and passes it to read_csv()
   - Default separator is '\s+' (one or more whitespace characters)
   - It inherits parameters from read_csv()

2. There is NO documentation about automatic index column detection:
   - The documentation does not mention that leading tabs or spaces trigger index column detection
   - The documentation does not describe any special behavior for handling leading whitespace
   - The index_col parameter is inherited from read_csv() but not explicitly documented for read_clipboard()

3. The read_csv() documentation for index_col states:
   - It accepts column label(s) or index(es) to use as row labels
   - index_col=False can be used to force pandas NOT to use the first column as index
   - No mention of automatic detection based on leading tabs or whitespace

4. Code Comments vs Documentation:
   - The source code comment at line 109-110 says: "check the number of leading tabs in the first line to account for index columns"
   - This behavior is NOT documented in the public API documentation
   - This is an undocumented internal implementation detail

5. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:
   - Since this automatic index detection behavior is completely undocumented, users would have no way to know:
     a) That leading whitespace affects index column detection
     b) Whether it should count tabs, spaces, or total whitespace characters
     c) That this feature even exists

Conclusion:
The automatic index column detection based on leading whitespace is an UNDOCUMENTED feature. The documentation provides no guidance on how this should work, making it impossible for users to rely on any specific behavior. The code comment suggests it should count "leading tabs" but the implementation counts total whitespace length.
