## Bug Reproduction Report

### Bug Summary
The docstring for `pandas.compat.is_platform_power()` incorrectly states it returns "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture", but the implementation actually checks for Power architecture (PowerPC: ppc64, ppc64le).

### Reproduction Steps Performed

1. **Tested with pandas version 2.3.2**
   - Confirmed pandas is installed and functional

2. **Ran the bug report's reproduction code**
   - Executed the inspection code that prints both docstring and implementation
   - Output confirmed the mismatch:
     * Docstring line 1: "Checking if the running platform use Power architecture." (correct)
     * Docstring return description: "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture." (incorrect)
     * Implementation: `platform.machine() in ("ppc64", "ppc64le")` (checks for Power, not ARM)

3. **Ran the property-based test**
   - The test correctly failed with: "Documentation for is_platform_power() incorrectly states it checks for ARM architecture, but the implementation checks for Power architecture (ppc64, ppc64le). This is a documentation bug."

4. **Verified source code directly**
   - Located function in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/compat/__init__.py
   - Lines 118-127 contain the function with the incorrect docstring
   - Line 125 specifically says "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture" which is wrong

5. **Checked current main branch on GitHub**
   - Confirmed the bug still exists in the latest main branch
   - The same incorrect docstring is present

### Effect of the Bug
This is a clear documentation error where:
- The function name is `is_platform_power` (correct)
- The function checks for Power/PowerPC architectures: ppc64, ppc64le (correct)
- The docstring incorrectly states it returns True for ARM architecture (incorrect)

Power (PowerPC) and ARM are completely different CPU architectures. This documentation would mislead users about what the function actually does. There is a separate `is_platform_arm()` function that correctly checks for ARM architectures.
