## Bug Reproduction Report

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. The issue is confirmed in pandas.core.util.hashing._hash_ndarray function.

### Test Results

1. **Direct reproduction test:**
   - complex64 arrays produce different hash values than expected
   - complex64 hash: [14559484286230537508, 13875018978056565111]
   - Expected (using real + 23*imag formula): [1566622401970978605, 9473140185629080060]
   - Match: False

   - complex128 arrays hash correctly using the formula
   - complex128 hash matches expected values
   - Match: True

2. **Hypothesis test:**
   - The property-based test fails immediately with simple inputs like [1j]
   - complex64 arrays are not hashed using the same formula as complex128

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug is in line 294 of pandas/core/util/hashing.py:
```python
if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.complex128):
```

This condition only matches complex128 (16 bytes), not complex64 (8 bytes):
- np.issubdtype(complex64, np.complex128) returns False
- np.issubdtype(complex128, np.complex128) returns True

As a result:
- complex128 arrays are correctly hashed as: hash(real) + 23 * hash(imag)
- complex64 arrays fall through to line 305-306 and are treated as generic 8-byte numbers
- complex64 values are viewed directly as uint64, losing the semantic structure of real/imaginary parts

### Impact

The bug causes:
1. Inconsistent hashing between complex64 and complex128 arrays with same values
2. complex64 values being hashed based on their raw byte representation rather than their mathematical structure
3. Violation of the principle that mathematically equivalent values should hash consistently

The bug is easily reproducible and affects all complex64 arrays in pandas hashing operations.
