BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS

Let me evaluate this bug report against each possible category:

## 1. INVALID (The report is wrong)
Arguments AGAINST INVALID:
- The bug is real and reproducible - hash_key truly doesn't affect numeric arrays
- The code behavior doesn't match reasonable expectations based on the API
- The parameter is accepted but silently ignored

Arguments FOR INVALID:
- The documentation does say "Hash_key for string key to encode" which could imply it's only for strings
- However, this is too vague to definitively exclude other types

Verdict: NOT INVALID - The bug exists and violates reasonable expectations

## 2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
Arguments FOR WONTFIX:
- Most users probably don't change the hash_key parameter
- The current behavior has existed for a long time without major complaints
- Numeric array hashing works fine without the key

Arguments AGAINST WONTFIX:
- This is a clear API contract violation - accepting a parameter that does nothing
- Security-sensitive applications might rely on hash_key for determinism/uniqueness
- Silent parameter ignoring is a bad practice that can lead to bugs
- The fix is straightforward (incorporate hash_key into numeric hashing)

Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - This is a substantive issue affecting API consistency

## 3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
Arguments FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could argue that hash_key support for numeric arrays is a new feature
- The documentation hints it might be string-specific

Arguments AGAINST FEATURE_REQUEST:
- The function already accepts the parameter for all inputs
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new
- Users expect parameters to work as advertised

Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing existing broken functionality

## 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
Arguments FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation is ambiguous about hash_key usage
- Could simply update docs to say "hash_key only affects object/string arrays"
- The phrase "for string key to encode" hints at limited scope

Arguments AGAINST DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The API design itself is flawed - accepting unused parameters
- Just documenting the limitation doesn't fix the poor design
- The function signature promises functionality it doesn't deliver

Verdict: POSSIBLE but not ideal - While documentation could be clearer, the core issue is the code behavior

## 5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
Arguments FOR BUG:
- Parameter is accepted but silently ignored for most data types
- Violates principle of least surprise
- No clear documentation that hash_key is type-specific
- API contract violation - function signature implies the parameter matters
- Security/determinism implications if users rely on different keys
- The fix is straightforward and improves consistency

Arguments AGAINST BUG:
- The vague documentation "for string key to encode" could be interpreted as string-only
- Existing behavior might be relied upon by some users

Verdict: STRONG CANDIDATE - This is a legitimate bug in the implementation

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

This appears to be a legitimate BUG. While the documentation has a hint that hash_key might be string-related ("for string key to encode"), this is far too vague to excuse the current behavior where:

1. The parameter is accepted for all input types
2. It silently does nothing for numeric arrays
3. There's no warning or error when it won't be used
4. Users reasonably expect all parameters to affect the output

The proper fix would be to either:
- Make hash_key affect all array types (preferred)
- Raise a warning/error when hash_key is provided for numeric arrays
- At minimum, clearly document this limitation

Given that the parameter is silently ignored despite being accepted, and this violates reasonable API expectations, this should be categorized as BUG.
