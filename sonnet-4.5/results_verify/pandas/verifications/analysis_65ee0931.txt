## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug) - Why it might be:
1. **Clear deviation from documented behavior**: The docstring and comments explicitly state non-lists should be returned unchanged, but they are corrupted instead
2. **Operator precedence error**: Classic programming mistake where `not x == y and z == w` doesn't mean what the developer intended
3. **Data corruption**: The function corrupts valid JSON objects by stripping characters and breaking the JSON structure
4. **Reproducible with simple inputs**: The bug reliably occurs with basic JSON objects like `{"key": "value"}`
5. **Fix is straightforward**: Adding parentheses to correct the operator precedence resolves the issue
6. **Impact on functionality**: The function fails to handle the most common JSON type (objects) correctly when used with `to_json(lines=True)`

### INVALID - Why it might be:
1. It's not - the bug is clearly valid and violates documented behavior
2. The function explicitly states it should return non-lists unchanged

### WONTFIX - Why it might be:
1. **Internal function**: It's a private helper function (in _normalize module)
2. **Limited exposure**: Only used internally by to_json() with lines=True
3. However, the bug causes data corruption which is serious enough to warrant fixing

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be:
1. Could argue the documentation should be clearer about what "return the json object" means
2. However, the code clearly intends to return non-lists unchanged based on the comment
3. The documentation matches the intended behavior, the code is wrong

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be:
1. It's not - the function already claims to support this behavior in its documentation
2. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

### Final Assessment:

**This is clearly a BUG that should be fixed.**

Reasoning:
1. The function's documentation (both docstring and inline comments) explicitly states that non-list JSON should be returned unchanged
2. The current implementation corrupts JSON objects, which is data corruption - a serious issue
3. The bug is caused by a classic operator precedence error that has a simple fix
4. The bug affects a real use case: when users call `df.to_json(lines=True)` with data that serializes to a JSON object
5. The fix is trivial and low-risk: adding parentheses to correct the boolean logic
6. Even though it's an internal function, it's used by the public `to_json()` API

The severity is medium to high because:
- It causes data corruption (JSON objects become invalid)
- It affects a public API pathway (to_json with lines=True)
- The corrupted output is invalid JSON that will fail to parse
- Users may not immediately notice the corruption until they try to read the data back
