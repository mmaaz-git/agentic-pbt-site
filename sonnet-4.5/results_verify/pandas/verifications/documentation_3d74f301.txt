DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer
================================================================

1. FUNCTION LOCATION AND VISIBILITY:
   - The function is located in pandas.core.indexers.utils, which is part of pandas' PRIVATE internal API
   - The pandas.core namespace is explicitly marked as private (not part of the public API)
   - No public documentation exists on pandas.pydata.org for this function
   - The function is not exposed through pandas.api.indexers (the public indexing API)

2. FUNCTION DOCSTRING:
   The function has a minimal docstring:
   ```
   """
   Return the expected length of target[indexer]

   Returns
   -------
   int
   """
   ```

   The docstring explicitly states the function should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
   This is a clear contract: the function should return what len(target[indexer]) would return.

3. FUNCTION PURPOSE:
   - Based on code inspection, this function is used internally by pandas for validation and optimization
   - It's used in check_setitem_lengths() at line 175 to validate slice assignment operations
   - The function attempts to calculate the length without actually performing the slice operation

4. PUBLIC VS PRIVATE API:
   - This is clearly an internal/private function not meant for direct public use
   - Users should not be importing from pandas.core directly
   - The lack of public documentation reinforces this is internal implementation detail

5. DOCUMENTATION CLARITY:
   The docstring, while minimal, is unambiguous about the expected behavior:
   - It should return the same value as len(target[indexer])
   - This creates a clear contract that the function must match Python's built-in slicing behavior

6. RELATED DOCUMENTATION:
   - Python's slice object has a well-defined .indices() method that normalizes slice parameters
   - The Python Language Reference defines slice behavior for negative indices on sequences
   - When a negative index is used on an empty sequence, Python correctly handles it by normalizing to valid bounds
