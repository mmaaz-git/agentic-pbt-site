## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation (from docstring)
The `format_percentiles` function in pandas is an internal utility function located in `pandas.io.formats.format`. It's used primarily by `describe()` method to format percentiles for display. The function's docstring explicitly states:

1. **Contract 1**: "no entry is *rounded* to 0% or 100%" (emphasis on *rounded* - unless already equal to it)
2. **Contract 2**: "Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place"

The function is designed to:
- Keep all entries different after rounding (if they were different originally)
- Prevent rounding to exactly 0% or 100% unless the value is already exactly 0.0 or 1.0

### Test Cases Analysis
The existing test cases in `pandas/tests/io/formats/test_format.py` verify:
- Values near but not at 0 or 1 get appropriate decimal places (e.g., 0.02001 -> "2.0%", 0.9999 -> "99.99%")
- Integer percentages display without decimals (e.g., 0.5 -> "50%")
- The function handles edge cases near 100% correctly (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999)

However, notably absent from the test cases are:
- Tests for extremely small values (< 1e-10)
- Tests that verify the "no rounding to 0%" contract for non-zero values

### External Documentation
- No public API documentation exists for this function as it's internal
- The function is not mentioned in official pandas documentation
- GitHub issues reveal historical problems with percentile precision (#13104)

### Key Finding
The documentation (docstring) clearly states the function's contract, which the implementation violates for extremely small values. The bug report correctly identifies that the function's behavior contradicts its documented specification.
