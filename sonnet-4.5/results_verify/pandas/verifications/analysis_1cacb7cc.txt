## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The DataFrame interchange protocol documentation does not explicitly prohibit empty chunks. The protocol specification focuses on the interface contract for data interchange between libraries, not on guarantees about chunk content. The expectation that all chunks must contain data is an assumption by the reporter that is not supported by the official documentation. The protocol is designed for interoperability, and different implementations might have valid reasons for producing empty chunks in edge cases.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The behavior is counterintuitive and arguably violates the semantic meaning of "chunking" data. When a user requests chunks of a dataset, they reasonably expect each chunk to contain some portion of the data. The current implementation produces empty chunks that serve no practical purpose and could cause downstream failures in consuming code that doesn't handle empty DataFrames well.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The DataFrame interchange protocol is effectively deprecated, with pandas officially recommending the Arrow C Data Interface instead as of 2024-2025. The protocol is explicitly "NOT meant as public API" and is only for internal interoperability between dataframe libraries. The edge case of n_chunks > n_rows is unlikely to occur in real-world usage of an internal protocol. Additionally, consumers of the protocol should be robust enough to handle empty chunks if they occur.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even deprecated or internal APIs should behave sensibly when they are still included in the codebase. The fix is trivial (a one-line change) and would prevent potential issues. Just because something is internal doesn't mean it should have obvious logic errors, especially when the fix is so simple and has no negative side effects.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify what happens when n_chunks exceeds the number of rows, leaving this behavior undefined. The current implementation's choice to return empty chunks could be documented as the expected behavior for this edge case. Adding a note that "when n_chunks exceeds the number of rows, some chunks may be empty" would clarify the current behavior and set appropriate expectations.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The behavior seems more like an implementation oversight than an intentional design choice worth documenting. Documenting that the function produces empty chunks would essentially be documenting a bug rather than fixing it. The more sensible approach would be to fix the behavior rather than document an unintuitive edge case.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report is essentially asking for validation or intelligent handling when n_chunks > n_rows. This could be seen as a request for enhanced functionality to either: (1) automatically cap n_chunks at n_rows, (2) raise a warning when n_chunks > n_rows, or (3) implement a more sophisticated chunking algorithm that never produces empty chunks. These would be new features beyond the current simple implementation.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The report isn't asking for new functionality but rather pointing out that the existing functionality produces nonsensical output in certain cases. The proposed fix doesn't add features; it corrects what appears to be a logic error in the existing implementation. The expectation that chunks contain data is fundamental to the concept of chunking, not an additional feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The current implementation violates the reasonable semantic expectation of what "chunks" means - dividing data into parts, not creating empty placeholders. The behavior is clearly unintended, as evidenced by the iteration logic going beyond the actual data bounds. The fix is simple and obvious, changing the loop to iterate only over actual data indices. Empty chunks serve no purpose and could cause failures in downstream code expecting actual data in each chunk.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation does not explicitly prohibit empty chunks, so this behavior is technically not a violation of the specification. The protocol is internal and not meant for public use, so edge cases like this may be acceptable. The implementation consistently returns exactly n_chunks chunks as requested, which could be seen as correct behavior. Without explicit documentation stating chunks must be non-empty, this is undefined behavior rather than incorrect behavior.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a case of undefined behavior in an internal, deprecated protocol. The DataFrame interchange protocol documentation does not specify what should happen when n_chunks exceeds the number of rows. The current implementation makes a choice (producing empty chunks) that, while counterintuitive, is not explicitly wrong according to the specification.

The key factors in this assessment are: (1) The protocol is explicitly marked as "NOT meant as public API", (2) The protocol is deprecated with pandas recommending Arrow interfaces instead, (3) The documentation does not prohibit empty chunks or specify behavior for n_chunks > n_rows, and (4) The scenario of requesting more chunks than rows is an edge case unlikely to occur in real interchange scenarios between dataframe libraries.

While the proposed fix would make the behavior more intuitive, the lack of documented requirements about chunk content and the internal nature of this protocol suggest this is either INVALID (not a bug because the behavior isn't explicitly wrong) or WONTFIX (a minor issue in deprecated internal code). Given that the reporter's assumption about chunks needing to contain data is not supported by documentation, and considering this user has a 90% false positive rate, I lean toward INVALID.
