## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is an internal utility with minimal documentation that doesn't explicitly promise to match Python's slice behavior. One could argue that since it's not part of the public API and the documentation doesn't specify exact behavior for negative step slices, the current behavior might be intentional for some internal pandas use case we're not aware of.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function's name "length_of_indexer" and its docstring "Return the expected length of target[indexer]" clearly indicate it should return the length that would result from applying the indexer. Returning negative lengths is mathematically nonsensical and breaks the fundamental contract implied by the function name. The fact that it works correctly for some cases but not others suggests a bug rather than intentional design.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal utility function not part of the public API. If pandas internally never uses this function with negative step slices where start/stop are None, the bug might never manifest in actual pandas operations. Maintainers might consider it too obscure to fix if it doesn't affect any real use cases.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Returning negative lengths is fundamentally wrong and could cause serious issues if any code path does encounter this scenario. The function is clearly meant to calculate lengths (which are non-negative by definition), and the fix is straightforward using Python's built-in slice.indices() method. This isn't a minor edge case but a fundamental correctness issue.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to specify that the function doesn't support negative step slices with None values, making the current behavior "expected" rather than buggy. The sparse documentation doesn't explicitly promise Python slice compatibility.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function name and purpose clearly indicate it should return a length (non-negative integer). Documenting that it returns negative values for certain inputs would be documenting a bug rather than clarifying intended behavior. The issue is with the implementation, not the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that proper support for negative step slices with None values is a new feature that was never implemented, rather than a bug in existing functionality. The current code might have been written without considering this case.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already attempts to handle negative steps (it has specific logic for when step < 0), indicating that support for negative steps was intended. The implementation is just incorrect. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function returns mathematically invalid negative lengths for valid Python slice operations. It has logic specifically for handling negative steps, but this logic is incorrect when start/stop are None. The function name and docstring clearly indicate it should return the length of applying an indexer, which should always be non-negative. The proposed fix is simple and uses Python's standard slice.indices() method to handle all cases correctly.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug is that it's an internal utility function with minimal documentation, so perhaps the current behavior is somehow intentional for pandas' internal use. However, this seems highly unlikely given that lengths are by definition non-negative.

## Overall Consideration

After thorough analysis, this appears to be a clear BUG. The function `length_of_indexer` is designed to return the length that would result from applying an indexer to a target sequence. Lengths are, by mathematical definition, non-negative integers. The function returning negative values like -5 for valid slice operations is unambiguously incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles Python's slice semantics for negative steps. When step is negative and start/stop are None, Python uses different default values (start=n-1, stop=-1) than for positive steps (start=0, stop=n). The pandas function fails to account for this, resulting in incorrect calculations that produce negative "lengths."

While this is an internal utility function, it's still a correctness issue that should be fixed. The proposed solution using Python's built-in slice.indices() method is elegant and correct, properly handling all edge cases. The fact that the function already has code attempting to handle negative steps shows this was intended functionality that's simply implemented incorrectly. This is not a documentation issue, missing feature, or trivial edge case - it's a fundamental logic error that produces mathematically invalid results.
