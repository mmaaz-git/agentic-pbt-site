## Bug Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Silent incorrect results:** inv_boxcox returns infinity for valid inputs without any error or warning, which is clearly incorrect behavior
2. **Documentation implies round-trips work:** The inv_boxcox documentation explicitly shows a round-trip example, creating reasonable expectation that this should work
3. **Mathematical inconsistency:** The Box-Cox transformation is mathematically invertible for all valid inputs (x > 0), so failures represent implementation issues
4. **Severity of failures:** Returning infinity instead of the correct value (e.g., 50 or 100) is a severe error that could corrupt downstream calculations
5. **No parameter validation:** Functions accept parameters that lead to numerical instability without warning

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Could be considered a known limitation of floating-point arithmetic
- Extreme parameter values might be considered outside typical use cases

**Assessment:** STRONG case for BUG

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Extreme edge cases:** Lambda values < -6 with large x values might be considered obscure use cases
2. **Floating-point limitations:** Could argue this is inherent to IEEE floating-point arithmetic
3. **Performance considerations:** Adding checks might slow down the common case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **Silent failures are never acceptable:** Returning infinity without warning is too severe to ignore
2. **Not that obscure:** Lambda values of -8 or -10 are not unreasonably extreme for statistical transformations
3. **Easy to add warnings:** Simple parameter range checks would prevent surprises

**Assessment:** WEAK case for WONTFIX

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug is clearly reproducible and represents actual incorrect behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **Reproducible failures:** All reported issues are consistently reproducible
2. **Clear incorrect outputs:** Returning infinity when the correct answer is 50 or 100 is objectively wrong
3. **Documentation supports expectations:** The example shows round-trips should work

**Assessment:** NO case for INVALID

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Missing warnings:** Documentation lacks any mention of numerical stability issues
2. **Misleading example:** Shows round-trip without caveats about when it won't work
3. **Could document limitations:** Could add warnings about parameter ranges

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **More than documentation:** The actual behavior (returning infinity) is incorrect, not just undocumented
2. **Mathematical expectation:** The transformation should be invertible; this isn't just a documentation issue
3. **Severity:** Silent infinity returns are too severe to solve with documentation alone

**Assessment:** PARTIAL case, but insufficient given severity

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Requesting better numerical stability:** Could frame as request for improved algorithm
2. **Warning system:** Adding warnings could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **Core functionality broken:** Round-trip property is fundamental, not a new feature
2. **Silent failures:** Returning wrong results isn't missing functionality, it's broken functionality
3. **Mathematical correctness:** The inverse should work for all valid inputs by definition

**Assessment:** WEAK case for FEATURE_REQUEST

### Final Analysis

This is clearly a **BUG** that should be filed and addressed. The key factors are:

1. **Severity:** Returning infinity instead of correct values is a critical failure
2. **Silent failure:** No warnings or errors when results are wrong
3. **Violated expectations:** Documentation shows round-trips working without caveats
4. **Mathematical incorrectness:** The Box-Cox transformation is mathematically invertible for all x > 0
5. **Impact:** Could cause silent data corruption in statistical analyses

While there are numerical stability challenges with extreme parameters, the current behavior of silently returning infinity is unacceptable. At minimum, the functions should:
- Warn when operating in numerically unstable regions
- Never return infinity without an error
- Document limitations clearly

The appropriate response is to file this as a BUG that needs fixing, either through:
1. Improved numerical algorithms for extreme parameters
2. Parameter validation with appropriate warnings/errors
3. Both algorithm improvements and validation
