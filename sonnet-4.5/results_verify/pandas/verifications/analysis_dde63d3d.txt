TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID - Why it might be INVALID:
   - Exception type inconsistency is not explicitly wrong behavior
   - The functions work correctly (both reject non-UTF-8 encodings)
   - Documentation doesn't specify what exceptions should be raised

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The inconsistency is real and demonstrable
   - It violates the principle of least surprise for API design
   - Similar functions performing the same validation should behave consistently

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - This is a low-severity issue (as noted in the bug report)
   - Both exceptions communicate the error adequately
   - Changing exception types could break existing code
   - The inconsistency doesn't prevent the functions from working

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - encoding parameters are commonly used
   - The fix is trivial (change one exception type)
   - It improves API consistency and user experience
   - This is not about internal functions but public API

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could be viewed as requesting better API consistency

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This is about fixing existing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
   - Both functions already validate encoding - they just do it inconsistently
   - The bug report identifies incorrect existing behavior, not missing features

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The encoding parameter is completely undocumented
   - The exceptions raised are not documented
   - Could document the current (inconsistent) behavior

   Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code behavior itself is inconsistent and should be fixed
   - Documenting inconsistent behavior doesn't make it correct
   - The bug is in the implementation, not just the documentation

5. BUG - Why it IS a BUG:
   - Two functions performing identical validation raise different exception types
   - This violates API consistency principles
   - The bug report correctly identifies that ValueError is more appropriate than NotImplementedError
   - NotImplementedError suggests missing functionality when the rejection is actually a validation error
   - Makes error handling unnecessarily complex for users
   - The fix is straightforward and improves the API

Additional Considerations:
- The bug report makes a valid point about exception semantics: NotImplementedError incorrectly suggests that non-UTF-8 support might be added in the future, when it's actually a design constraint
- ValueError is the standard Python exception for invalid parameter values
- The inconsistency serves no useful purpose and appears to be an oversight
- Even though severity is low, this is still a genuine bug in API design

CONCLUSION:
This is a valid BUG. While not critical, it represents inconsistent behavior in the public API that makes error handling more complex than necessary. The appropriate exception type (ValueError) is already being used in one function, and the other should be updated to match.
