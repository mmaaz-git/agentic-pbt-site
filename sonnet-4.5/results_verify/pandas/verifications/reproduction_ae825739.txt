REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable.

1. Property-Based Test Results:
The hypothesis test correctly identifies the bug. When run, it finds multiple failing examples:
- Pattern '\\' raises re.PatternError: bad escape (end of pattern) at position 0
- Pattern '[' raises re.PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0
The test expects is_re_compilable to return False for these invalid patterns, but instead the function raises exceptions.

2. Minimal Example Reproduction:
Running the provided minimal examples confirms the bug:
- is_re_compilable("[") raises PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0
  (Expected: False)
- is_re_compilable(")") raises PatternError: unbalanced parenthesis at position 0
  (Expected: False)
- is_re_compilable("?") raises PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
  (Expected: False)
- is_re_compilable("\\") raises PatternError: bad escape (end of pattern) at position 0
  (Expected: False)

3. Valid cases work correctly:
- is_re_compilable(".*") returns True (correct)
- is_re_compilable(123) returns False (correct - non-string handled properly)

4. Root Cause Analysis:
The function's implementation only catches TypeError exceptions (line 189), which handles non-string inputs.
However, re.compile() also raises re.error (which is aliased as re.PatternError) for invalid regex patterns.
These exceptions are not caught, causing them to propagate to the caller instead of returning False.

The bug is exactly as described in the report: the function fails to catch re.error exceptions for invalid regex patterns, violating its documented contract to return a bool indicating whether the object can be compiled as a regex pattern.
