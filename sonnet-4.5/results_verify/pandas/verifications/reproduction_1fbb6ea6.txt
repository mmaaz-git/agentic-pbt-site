Bug Reproduction Analysis
==========================

## Summary
The bug report is accurate and has been successfully reproduced. The error message in pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError.__init__ has swapped values when an invalid methodtype is provided.

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Hypothesis Test Execution**
   - Ran the provided property-based test using Hypothesis
   - Test failed as expected with input '0' (and would fail with any invalid methodtype)
   - Error message confirms the bug: "methodtype must be one of 0, got {'property', 'method', 'staticmethod', 'classmethod'} instead."

2. **Simple Reproduction**
   - Executed the simple reproduction code with methodtype="invalid"
   - Actual output: "methodtype must be one of invalid, got {'method', 'property', 'staticmethod', 'classmethod'} instead."
   - Expected output: "methodtype must be one of {'method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', 'property'}, got invalid instead."

3. **Source Code Verification**
   - Located the bug in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/errors/__init__.py
   - Line 298 contains the error message with swapped variables:
     ```python
     f"methodtype must be one of {methodtype}, got {types} instead."
     ```
   - Should be:
     ```python
     f"methodtype must be one of {types}, got {methodtype} instead."
     ```

## Impact
The bug causes confusion by presenting an error message that says:
- "methodtype must be one of <user's invalid input>" - which makes no logical sense
- "got <the actual valid options>" - which incorrectly suggests these were the invalid values

This is a clear violation of standard error message conventions where the expected values should come first, followed by what was actually received.

## Conclusion
The bug report is valid and accurately describes a real issue in the pandas library where the error message parameters are swapped, leading to a confusing and misleading error message.
