REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR REPORTED BUG
=====================================

BUG CLAIM:
The reporter claims that Series.str.slice_replace() loses data when start > stop, deleting characters between stop and start positions.

REPRODUCTION TESTS PERFORMED:

1. PRIMARY TEST CASE (strings=['abc'], start=2, stop=1):
   - Original string: 'abc'
   - Pandas result: 'abXc'
   - Expected result based on Python conventions: 'abXbc'
   - CONFIRMED: Data loss occurred - character 'b' at index 1 was deleted

2. NEGATIVE INDEX TEST (strings=['hello'], start=-1, stop=-3):
   - Original string: 'hello'
   - Pandas result: 'hellXo'
   - Expected result: 'hellXllo'
   - CONFIRMED: Data loss occurred - substring 'll' was deleted

3. LARGER INDEX GAP TEST (strings=['0123456789'], start=5, stop=3):
   - Original string: '0123456789'
   - Pandas result: '01234X56789'
   - Expected result: '01234X3456789'
   - CONFIRMED: Data loss occurred - substring '34' was deleted

4. NORMAL CASE CONTROL (start < stop):
   - Works correctly as documented
   - Result matches expected behavior

5. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   - The property-based test failed on the first example
   - Confirmed systematic failure when start > stop

SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS:
Located the bug in pandas/core/strings/object_array.py, lines 352-355:

```python
if x[start:stop] == "":
    local_stop = start
else:
    local_stop = stop
```

This code incorrectly sets local_stop to start when the slice is empty (which happens when start > stop), causing the function to use x[start:] instead of x[stop:] for the remainder of the string.

TECHNICAL IMPACT:
When start > stop:
- Python slice x[start:stop] correctly returns empty string
- But pandas incorrectly uses x[start:] for the remainder instead of x[stop:]
- This causes all characters between positions stop and start to be deleted
- The replacement string is inserted, but data is lost

VERIFICATION:
All test cases confirm the bug exactly as reported. The bug is 100% reproducible and the technical analysis in the bug report is accurate.
