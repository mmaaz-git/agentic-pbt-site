# Bug Reproduction Results

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue causes infinite recursion when calling `cumsum()` on a SparseArray with a non-null fill value (e.g., 0 for integers).

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Hypothesis Test
Ran the provided hypothesis test which attempts to call cumsum() on SparseArrays with fill_value=0. The test failed with a RecursionError as expected, confirming the bug.

### 2. Simple Example Reproduction
```python
from pandas.arrays import SparseArray
arr = SparseArray([1, 2, 3], fill_value=0)
result = arr.cumsum()  # RecursionError
```

This simple example triggers the RecursionError as described in the bug report.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/arrays/sparse/array.py:1549-1550` contains:
```python
if not self._null_fill_value:
    return SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()
```

The issue is that when `SparseArray(self.to_dense())` is called without specifying a fill_value:
1. The constructor infers a default fill_value based on dtype (0 for integers)
2. This results in `_null_fill_value = False` for the new SparseArray
3. The cumsum() method is called again on this new array
4. Since `_null_fill_value` is still False, it enters the same code path
5. This creates infinite recursion

## Verification
Confirmed that when creating a SparseArray from dense integer data without specifying fill_value:
- The fill_value defaults to 0 (for integer dtype)
- This causes `_null_fill_value` to be False
- Leading to the infinite recursion loop

The bug is 100% reproducible and matches exactly what was described in the bug report.
