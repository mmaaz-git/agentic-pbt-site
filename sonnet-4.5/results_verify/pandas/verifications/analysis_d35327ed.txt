## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)
**Strong Evidence:**
- The function's docstring explicitly states: "Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place"
- The input 0.8899967487632947 (88.99967487632946%) is mathematically not an integer percentage
- The function outputs "89%" without a decimal place, directly violating the documented contract
- The property-based test correctly identifies multiple failing cases
- The root cause is clear: np.isclose() incorrectly classifies near-integers as integers

**Why this should be BUG:**
This is a clear violation of documented behavior. The function promises a specific formatting rule but fails to deliver it due to an implementation flaw.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Weak Evidence:**
- None. The bug report is technically accurate and the code demonstrably violates its documentation.

**Why this is NOT INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies a real discrepancy between documented and actual behavior.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Possible Arguments:**
- The edge case (values very close to integers after rounding) might be considered obscure
- Users might not care about the difference between "89%" and "89.0%" in practice
- The current behavior using np.isclose() might be intentional for numerical stability

**Why this is NOT WONTFIX:**
- The documentation makes an explicit promise without exceptions
- The bug affects precision-critical applications (e.g., statistical reporting)
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Weak Evidence:**
- One could argue the documentation describes an aspirational behavior not yet implemented

**Why this is NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The documentation clearly states this as current behavior ("is always rounded")
- The examples in the docstring demonstrate the intended behavior
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Possible Arguments:**
- The documentation could be updated to say "Any non-integer (except those very close to integers after rounding)"
- The current behavior with np.isclose() might be the intended design

**Why this MIGHT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- If the developers intentionally used np.isclose() for numerical stability reasons
- If changing the behavior would break existing code that relies on this formatting

**Why this is likely NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation is very explicit and clear about the behavior
- The examples show non-integers with decimal places
- Changing documentation to match buggy behavior is generally not preferred

### Final Assessment
This is a **BUG**. The function clearly violates its documented contract. The documentation makes an unambiguous promise that "Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place," and the function fails to honor this promise for certain inputs. The bug has a clear root cause (inappropriate use of np.isclose()) and a straightforward fix.

The severity is correctly marked as "Low" since:
- It's a formatting issue, not a calculation error
- It only affects edge cases near integer boundaries
- Workarounds exist (manual formatting)

However, it should still be fixed to maintain consistency with documented behavior.
