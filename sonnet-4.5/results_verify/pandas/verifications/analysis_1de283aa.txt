## Bug Report Analysis by Category

### BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **API Inconsistency**: hash_array() handles empty inputs gracefully, hash_tuples() crashes - this is inconsistent behavior within the same module
2. **No Documentation**: The docstring doesn't specify that empty lists are invalid input
3. **Type System Compatibility**: The function accepts `Iterable[tuple[Hashable, ...]]` which includes empty iterables
4. **Infrastructure Exists**: The underlying `combine_hash_arrays` function already handles empty cases properly
5. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Users would reasonably expect consistent behavior across hashing functions
6. **Simple Fix Available**: The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Could argue that tuples need structure to be hashed, and empty lists have no structure to infer

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could claim that hash_tuples is specifically for multi-level data and empty data has no levels
- The error message is clear about what went wrong

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't say empty inputs are invalid
- The type signature accepts empty iterables
- Other similar functions in the same module handle empty inputs
- The error comes from an internal implementation detail (MultiIndex.from_tuples), not from intentional validation

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Very edge case - hashing empty tuple lists is rare in practice
- Workaround exists (check for empty before calling)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is simple and non-breaking
- API consistency is important for a major library like pandas
- Not that obscure - empty collections are common edge cases to handle

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that hash_tuples requires non-empty input
- Could add a note about the difference from hash_array

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This would cement the inconsistency rather than fix it
- The behavior seems unintentional rather than by design
- Would still violate principle of least surprise

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame as "add support for empty tuple lists"
- Not explicitly promised in current documentation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
- Empty input handling is a basic edge case, not a new feature
- The related function already handles this case

## Conclusion

This appears to be a **BUG** because:

1. **Clear API Inconsistency**: Two closely related functions in the same module (hash_array and hash_tuples) handle the same edge case differently without documentation explaining why

2. **No Intentional Design**: The error comes from MultiIndex.from_tuples(), not from explicit validation in hash_tuples. This suggests the behavior is accidental rather than intentional

3. **Type System Mismatch**: The function signature accepts empty iterables but the implementation doesn't handle them

4. **Easy Fix**: The underlying infrastructure (combine_hash_arrays) already handles empty cases, making the fix trivial

5. **Reasonable Expectation**: Users would reasonably expect hash_tuples([]) to return np.array([], dtype=np.uint64) based on:
   - How hash_array behaves
   - The general pattern in NumPy/pandas of returning empty arrays for empty inputs
   - The lack of documentation stating otherwise

The bug report correctly identifies this as an inconsistency that violates the principle of least surprise. While it's a low-severity edge case, it's still a legitimate bug in the API consistency of the pandas hashing utilities.
