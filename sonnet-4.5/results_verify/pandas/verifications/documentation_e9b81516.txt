## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation:
The `length_of_indexer` function has minimal documentation:
```python
def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
    """
    Return the expected length of target[indexer]

    Returns
    -------
    int
    """
```

### Key Findings:

1. **Function Status:**
   - `pandas.core.indexers.utils` is part of the PRIVATE pandas API (pandas.core.* modules are not public)
   - The function is NOT documented in the official pandas API reference
   - It's an internal utility function used by pandas' indexing machinery

2. **Documented Contract:**
   The docstring clearly states the function should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
   - This is unambiguous: it should return the length that would result from `len(target[indexer])`
   - A length is by definition non-negative (cannot be -1, -2, etc.)

3. **Usage Context:**
   - The function is used internally by `pandas.core.indexing` module
   - Comment in the code states: "lplane_indexer gives the expected length of obj[indexer[0]]"
   - Used by `check_setitem_lengths` for validation during assignment operations

4. **No Special Cases Documented:**
   - There's no documentation suggesting negative lengths are valid returns
   - No documentation about special handling for negative-step slices
   - No indication that the function behavior for negative steps is undefined

### Conclusion:
The documentation, though minimal, is clear: the function should return the expected length of the indexing operation. Returning negative values violates this documented contract, as lengths are inherently non-negative integers. The bug represents a clear deviation from the documented behavior.
