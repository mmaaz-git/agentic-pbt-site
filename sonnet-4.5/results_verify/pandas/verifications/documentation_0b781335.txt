Documentation Analysis
=====================

## Official pandas.cut Documentation Review:

The official pandas documentation states that pd.cut is designed to "bin values into discrete intervals" and convert continuous variables into categorical variables.

### Key documented behaviors:
1. **Purpose**: Discretize continuous data into categorical bins
2. **NaN handling**: "NA values remain NA in results" and "Out-of-bounds values become NA"
3. **Return value**: Should return a Categorical, Series, or ndarray with bin assignments
4. **Edge cases**: Documentation mentions handling of duplicate bin edges via the 'duplicates' parameter

### What the documentation does NOT specify:
- No explicit mention of behavior with extremely small float values near machine epsilon
- No warning about potential precision issues with values close to zero
- No documented limitation on the magnitude of values that can be binned

### Expected behavior based on documentation:
The documentation implies that all valid (non-NaN) input values should be successfully binned into intervals. The only documented cases where values should become NaN are:
1. Input values that are already NaN
2. Values that fall outside the bin ranges

The current behavior where valid input values become NaN due to internal precision issues is NOT documented or expected based on the available documentation.

### Conclusion:
The bug violates the documented contract of pd.cut. The function should successfully bin ALL valid input values into discrete intervals, regardless of their magnitude. Silent data loss (converting valid values to NaN) without any warning or error is not a documented or expected behavior.
