DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Function Documentation

The format_percentiles function has clear documentation in its docstring:

### Purpose:
"Outputs rounded and formatted percentiles."

### Parameters:
- percentiles: list-like, containing floats from interval [0,1]

### Returns:
- formatted: list of strings

### Documented Guarantees:

The docstring explicitly states two guarantees:

1. **UNIQUENESS PRESERVATION**: "Rounding precision is chosen so that: (1) if any two elements of percentiles differ, they remain different after rounding"

2. **NO ROUNDING TO EXTREMES**: "(2) no entry is *rounded* to 0% or 100%. Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place."

3. **DUPLICATES ALLOWED**: "Duplicates are allowed" - meaning the function should handle duplicate input values correctly

### Validation:
The function validates that all percentiles are:
- Numeric
- In the interval [0,1]
- Not NaN

## Assessment Against Bug Report:

1. **The uniqueness guarantee IS explicitly documented** - The bug report correctly identifies that the function violates its own documentation when [0.0, 2.225073858507203e-309] both become '0%'

2. **Valid input range is [0,1]** - The bug report's test inputs are all within this valid range

3. **Invalid outputs like 'inf%' and 'nan%' are NOT documented as acceptable** - These outputs violate the basic contract of returning valid formatted percentage strings

4. **The function should handle ALL values in [0,1]** - There is no documentation suggesting that extremely small values near zero are unsupported

## Conclusion:

The documentation clearly establishes that:
- Different input percentiles should remain different in output
- All values in [0,1] should be handled correctly
- Output should be valid percentage strings

The bug violates all three of these documented behaviors, making it a legitimate bug rather than undefined behavior or a documentation issue.
