PANDAS.QCUT DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS

Based on the official pandas documentation:

1. Function Purpose:
   - pandas.qcut() discretizes a variable into equal-sized buckets based on rank or sample quantiles
   - It creates categorical bins representing data distribution
   - The function is designed to create approximately equal-sized bins based on quantiles

2. duplicates Parameter:
   - The 'duplicates' parameter has two options: 'raise' (default) or 'drop'
   - 'raise': Triggers a ValueError if bin edges aren't unique
   - 'drop': Removes non-unique bin edges
   - The documentation explicitly states that duplicates='drop' is meant to handle cases where bin edges are not unique

3. Expected Behavior:
   - The documentation suggests using duplicates='drop' when encountering non-unique bin edges
   - The error message without duplicates='drop' explicitly tells users: "You can drop duplicate edges by setting the 'duplicates' kwarg"
   - This creates an expectation that duplicates='drop' should handle the case gracefully

4. Edge Cases and Limitations:
   - The documentation does not mention any specific limitations regarding extremely small float values (denormalized floats)
   - There is no documented restriction on the range of float values that can be used
   - No warnings about potential issues with values near machine epsilon or denormalized float ranges

5. Precision Handling:
   - The documentation mentions a 'precision' parameter for decimal precision of bin labels
   - However, it doesn't discuss internal precision handling for extremely small values or potential NaN issues

6. Key Finding:
   The documentation creates a clear expectation that when qcut fails with "Bin edges must be unique", users should be able to resolve it by setting duplicates='drop'. The current behavior violates this documented contract by throwing a different, confusing error when duplicates='drop' is used with certain edge cases involving tiny float values.
