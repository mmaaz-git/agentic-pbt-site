BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

INVALID:
Why it might be INVALID:
- The error is extremely small (2e-16), essentially machine epsilon
- Could be argued as expected behavior due to floating-point limitations
- The practical impact is minimal

Why it's NOT INVALID:
- The documentation explicitly states values are between -1 and 1
- Mathematical definition requires strict bounds
- NumPy handles this correctly, showing it's solvable
- The bug report is technically correct about the violation

WONTFIX:
Why it might be WONTFIX:
- The error magnitude is at machine epsilon level (~2e-16)
- Unlikely to cause real-world problems in most applications
- Could be considered an obscure edge case
- The computational cost of fixing might not be worth it for such tiny errors

Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
- Other libraries (NumPy) handle this correctly
- The fix is simple (clipping to valid range)
- Some applications may depend on the mathematical invariant
- It's a correctness issue, not just a performance one

DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- Could update docs to mention possible tiny violations due to floating-point arithmetic
- Could document that values are "approximately" in [-1, 1]

Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code behavior is incorrect, not the documentation
- Mathematical correlation must be in [-1, 1] by definition
- Changing documentation would be admitting to incorrect implementation

FEATURE_REQUEST:
Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could be seen as requesting enhanced numerical stability
- Asking for behavior that matches NumPy's implementation

Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The current behavior violates documented and mathematical constraints
- It's a bug fix, not an enhancement

BUG:
Why it IS a BUG:
- Function returns values outside its mathematically valid range
- Violates explicit documentation stating values are between -1 and 1
- Other libraries (NumPy) handle the same calculation correctly
- The fix is straightforward (clipping to [-1, 1])
- Could cause issues in downstream code that assumes valid correlation range
- While the error is tiny, it's still technically incorrect
- The mathematical definition of correlation requires strict bounds

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a valid BUG. While the numerical error is tiny (machine epsilon), the function violates both its documented behavior and the mathematical definition of correlation. The fact that NumPy handles this correctly shows it's a solvable problem. The proposed fix (clipping to valid range) is reasonable and would ensure mathematical correctness.
