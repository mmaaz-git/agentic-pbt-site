## Documentation Analysis for ensure_decoded

### Function Documentation
The function `ensure_decoded` in `pandas/core/computation/common.py` has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "If we have bytes, decode them to unicode."
- No formal API documentation exists (not in public pandas API docs)
- This is an internal utility function, not part of the public API

### Usage Context
The function is used internally in two main contexts:

1. **pandas.core.computation.pytables**: Used to decode metadata from HDF5/PyTables files
   - Decodes `self.kind` and `self.meta` attributes
   - Decodes string values before converting to Timestamp objects
   - These values come from HDF5 file attributes stored as bytes

2. **pandas.core.computation.ops**: Used when processing Timestamp values in query expressions

### Related Function
There's a similar function `_ensure_decoded` in `pandas/io/pytables.py` that:
- Has identical purpose ("if we have bytes, decode them to unicode")
- Uses hardcoded "UTF-8" encoding instead of `get_option("display.encoding")`
- Only handles `np.bytes_` type, not general `bytes`
- Also doesn't specify error handling

### Key Observations

1. **No Error Handling Specification**: Neither the docstring nor any documentation specifies how the function should behave with invalid byte sequences.

2. **Internal Function**: This is clearly an internal utility function (not in public API), used for decoding bytes from HDF5 files.

3. **Encoding Source**: Uses `get_option("display.encoding")` which defaults to 'utf-8' but could be configured differently.

4. **HDF5/PyTables Context**: The function is specifically used in the context of reading data from HDF5/PyTables files, where metadata and values can be stored as bytes.

5. **No Specification for Invalid Data**: There is no documentation stating:
   - What should happen with invalid UTF-8 sequences
   - Whether the function should handle corrupted or manually-created HDF5 files
   - What error handling strategy should be used

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify expected behavior for invalid byte sequences. The function's purpose is clear (decode bytes to unicode) but the error handling strategy is unspecified. This leaves the behavior for invalid UTF-8 sequences as undefined/unspecified behavior.
