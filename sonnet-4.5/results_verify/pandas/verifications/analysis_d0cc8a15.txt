## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Evaluation for Each Category:

#### INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The behavior is inconsistent: pandas silently converts large integers to object dtype but then fails in interchange
- User expectation of round-trip capability is reasonable given lack of documented limitations
- The error occurs in a public API function, not internal code

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The DataFrame Protocol specification doesn't explicitly claim to support arbitrary-precision integers
- Object dtypes are a pandas-specific implementation detail
- The protocol focuses on primitive types with defined bit widths

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Integers exceeding int64 range are extremely rare in practice
- The error message does indicate the limitation ("Non-string object dtypes are not supported yet")
- Supporting arbitrary-precision integers in an interchange protocol is complex
- Documentation already recommends using Arrow C Data Interface instead

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- Silent data type conversion followed by failure is poor user experience
- The issue affects data integrity and interoperability
- Python natively supports arbitrary-precision integers, users may expect this to work

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Neither pandas nor protocol documentation mentions this limitation
- Users have no way to know in advance that large integers will fail
- The __dataframe__() method succeeds, giving false impression of support
- Documentation could warn about integer size limitations

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code genuinely fails, it's not just a documentation issue
- Better error messaging alone wouldn't solve the underlying problem

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting arbitrary-precision integers would be a new capability
- The error message says "not supported yet", implying future support is planned
- This would extend the protocol beyond its current specification
- The protocol specification doesn't mandate support for object dtypes

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Round-trip capability is a fundamental expectation for data interchange
- pandas already creates these DataFrames naturally, so support seems necessary
- This feels more like fixing broken functionality than adding new features

#### BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- pandas silently converts integers to object dtype but then fails to handle them
- Violates principle of least surprise - data that pandas creates should be interchangeable
- No warning or error when creating the DataFrame or interchange object
- Failure only occurs at the final conversion step
- Round-trip property should reasonably be expected to work for data pandas accepts
- The inconsistency between what pandas accepts and what interchange supports is problematic

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The interchange protocol specification never claimed to support arbitrary-precision integers
- The limitation is somewhat documented via the error message
- This is an edge case with values outside normal integer bounds

### Critical Analysis:

1. **User Perspective**: A user creates a DataFrame with large integers, pandas accepts it without warning, __dataframe__() succeeds, but from_dataframe() fails. This inconsistent behavior is problematic.

2. **Design Intent**: The interchange protocol focuses on common data types with fixed representations. Arbitrary-precision integers don't fit this model.

3. **Error Quality**: While the error occurs, the message "Non-string object dtypes are not supported yet" is misleading - it suggests temporary limitation rather than fundamental incompatibility.

4. **Practical Impact**: The specific values causing issues (-2^63 - 1) are edge cases, but the silent failure pattern is concerning.

### Conclusion:

This falls between DOCUMENTATION_FIX and FEATURE_REQUEST. The core issue is that:
1. pandas accepts and creates DataFrames with large integers
2. The interchange protocol doesn't support these
3. This limitation is not documented
4. The failure happens late in the process after partial success

Given that:
- The interchange protocol specification doesn't promise support for arbitrary-precision integers
- The error message implies this is a known limitation ("not supported yet")
- The fix would require extending the protocol specification
- But the lack of documentation and poor error handling are also issues

This is best categorized as **FEATURE_REQUEST** because supporting arbitrary-precision integers would require extending the interchange protocol beyond its current specification. However, at minimum, this should trigger a documentation update to warn users about this limitation.
