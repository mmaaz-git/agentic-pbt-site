## Documentation Analysis for pandas.io.formats.printing.adjoin

### Function Documentation
The function's docstring clearly states:

```
Glues together two sets of strings using the amount of space requested.
The idea is to prettify.

Parameters:
----------
space : int
    number of spaces for padding
lists : str
    list of str which being joined
strlen : callable
    function used to calculate the length of each str. Needed for unicode handling.
justfunc : callable
    function used to justify str. Needed for unicode handling.
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Purpose of strlen parameter**: The documentation explicitly states that `strlen` is "function used to calculate the length of each str. Needed for unicode handling."

2. **Unicode handling**: The documentation specifically mentions that the `strlen` parameter is "Needed for unicode handling", indicating this is its primary purpose.

3. **Consistency expectation**: The documentation does not indicate that `strlen` should be applied differently to different lists. The parameter description implies it should be used for calculating "the length of each str" without any exceptions.

### Function Status

1. **Public function**: The function `adjoin` is exposed in the module's public interface (does not start with underscore).

2. **Internal usage**: The function is used internally by pandas in multiple modules:
   - pandas/io/formats/string.py
   - pandas/io/formats/format.py
   - pandas/io/pytables.py
   - pandas/core/indexes/multi.py
   - Also has tests in pandas/tests/io/formats/test_printing.py

3. **Related functionality**: The module has a `_TextAdjustment` class with its own `adjoin` method (line 524-525) that calls the main `adjoin` function with `strlen=self.len`, demonstrating that custom strlen functions are an expected use case.

### Unicode Context

The module also contains `_EastAsianTextAdjustment` class (lines 528-564) which provides a custom `len` method that considers East Asian character widths. This class's `adjoin` method would pass its custom `len` method as the `strlen` parameter, which is exactly the use case that would be broken by the inconsistent application of `strlen`.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly indicates that:
1. The `strlen` parameter should be used to calculate the length of "each str" (not just some strings)
2. This parameter is specifically designed for unicode handling
3. There is no documented reason why the last list should be treated differently
4. The bug directly contradicts the documented purpose of the parameter by not applying it consistently to all strings
