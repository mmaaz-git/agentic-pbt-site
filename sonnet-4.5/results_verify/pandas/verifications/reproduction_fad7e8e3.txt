BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.io.formats.format.format_percentiles.

TEST RESULTS:

1. Hypothesis Property-Based Test:
   - The test ran and FAILED as expected
   - Found a failing example: percentiles=[0.0, 2.2250738585072014e-308]
   - This confirms that the uniqueness preservation property is violated
   - The test correctly identifies cases where unique input values produce non-unique output

2. Manual Reproduction (Bug Report Example):
   - Input: [0.01, 0.0100001]
   - Output: ['1%', '1%']
   - Unique inputs: 2
   - Unique outputs: 1
   - This exactly matches what the bug report claimed

3. Additional Test Case (from Hypothesis):
   - Input: [0.0, 2.2250738585072014e-308]
   - Output: ['0%', '0%']
   - Unique inputs: 2
   - Unique outputs: 1
   - Shows the bug affects values very close to 0 as well

EFFECT OF THE BUG:

The function format_percentiles() is supposed to preserve uniqueness when formatting percentile values - that is, if two input percentiles are different, they should remain different in the formatted output. However, the function fails this guarantee when percentiles differ by very small amounts (less than approximately 1e-7 as fractions or 1e-5 as percentages).

This happens because the function uses np.isclose() with default tolerances to determine which values should be treated as integers. The default tolerances (rtol=1e-05, atol=1e-08) are too lenient, causing values that are numerically distinct to be treated as the same integer value, resulting in identical formatted strings.

The bug is reproducible and consistent across multiple test cases.
