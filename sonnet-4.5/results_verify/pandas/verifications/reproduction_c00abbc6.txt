REPRODUCTION OF BUG: pandas.io.parsers.read_csv Large Integer Type Loss

## Bug Reproduction Summary

The bug report is CONFIRMED and REPRODUCIBLE. When a DataFrame containing Python integers larger than int64 range is written to CSV and read back using read_csv, the integers are incorrectly converted to strings instead of being parsed as integers.

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction**
   - Ran the provided hypothesis test with overflow_amount=1
   - Result: Test FAILED as expected - AssertionError: Expected int, got str
   - The test correctly identifies that read_csv returns a string instead of int for large integers

2. **Simple Example Reproduction**
   - Created a DataFrame with value int64_min - 1 = -9223372036854775809
   - Original value type: int (Python arbitrary precision integer)
   - After CSV round-trip type: str (string)
   - The bug is confirmed: large integers become strings

## Detailed Test Results

Tested various integer values around int64 boundaries:
- int64_max (9223372036854775807): Works correctly, round-trips as int64
- int64_max + 1 (9223372036854775808): Works correctly, round-trips as uint64
- int64_min (-9223372036854775808): Works correctly, round-trips as int64
- int64_min - 1 (-9223372036854775809): BUG - becomes string instead of int
- 10^30: BUG - becomes string instead of int
- -10^30: BUG - becomes string instead of int

## Key Observations

1. **The bug only affects integers outside the int64/uint64 range**
   - Values within int64 bounds are correctly parsed as int64
   - Values that fit in uint64 are correctly parsed as uint64
   - Values outside both ranges become strings

2. **Pandas correctly writes the values to CSV**
   - The CSV file contains the correct numeric value as text
   - The issue is purely in the reading/parsing phase

3. **Workaround exists**
   - Using converters={'column': int} correctly parses the large integers
   - This proves the functionality exists, but the default behavior is inconsistent

4. **Data type inconsistency**
   - Original DataFrame stores large int as object dtype with Python int
   - After round-trip, it's object dtype with Python str
   - This violates the expectation that numeric data remains numeric

## Impact

This bug causes silent data type corruption. Users expecting numeric operations on large integers after CSV round-trip will encounter unexpected string values, potentially causing:
- Type errors in arithmetic operations
- Incorrect sorting behavior
- Failed numeric comparisons
- Unexpected behavior in data analysis pipelines
