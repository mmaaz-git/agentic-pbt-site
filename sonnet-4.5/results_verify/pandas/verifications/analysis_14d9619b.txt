## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if the documentation didn't guarantee that cumsum() should work for all fill values, or if using non-NA fill values was considered unsupported behavior. However, the documentation makes no such restrictions and cumsum() is a public API method that should work for all valid SparseArrays.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug is clearly valid because the code crashes with a RecursionError on valid inputs. The SparseArray constructor accepts fill_value=0 as valid input, and cumsum() is a documented method that should work on any valid SparseArray. The infinite recursion is an obvious implementation error, not expected behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue this is WONTFIX if non-NA fill values in SparseArrays are considered an edge case that's rarely used in practice. The documentation does mention that the result will have fill_value=np.nan regardless, suggesting NA is the expected fill value for most operations.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This cannot be WONTFIX because it causes a complete crash (RecursionError) rather than just incorrect output or a minor issue. The method is completely unusable for a valid subset of inputs. Any SparseArray with a non-NA fill value will crash when cumsum() is called, which is a severe functionality failure.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the intent was that cumsum() only works with NA fill values, then the documentation should be updated to clarify this limitation. The docs could be changed to explicitly state that cumsum() requires fill_value to be NA/NaN.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code clearly shows this is an implementation bug, not a documentation issue. Line 1550 attempts to handle non-NA fill values but does so incorrectly by creating infinite recursion. The intent is clearly to support all fill values, as evidenced by the conditional check for `_null_fill_value`.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that supporting cumsum() for non-NA fill values is a new feature that wasn't properly implemented. The current code path for non-NA fill values exists but doesn't work, suggesting it might be an incomplete feature.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not a feature request because the code already attempts to handle this case - it just does so incorrectly. The existence of the code path `if not self._null_fill_value:` shows that non-NA fill values were intended to be supported. The bug is in the implementation, not a missing feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is unquestionably a bug. The code at line 1550 creates infinite recursion by calling `SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()` when it should call `self.to_dense().cumsum()` and then wrap the result. The bug report correctly identifies the exact line and provides the correct fix. The method crashes with RecursionError on valid inputs that should work according to the documentation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There is no reasonable argument against this being a bug. The code crashes on valid inputs with an obvious implementation error that has a straightforward fix.

## Overall consideration

This is clearly a **BUG**. The analysis is straightforward:

1. The code contains an obvious implementation error at line 1550 where it incorrectly creates a new SparseArray and calls cumsum() recursively instead of calling cumsum() on the dense numpy array. This creates infinite recursion because the new SparseArray will have the same non-NA fill value and hit the same code path again.

2. The bug affects all SparseArrays with non-NA fill values, making the cumsum() method completely unusable for a valid subset of inputs. This is not a minor issue or edge case - it's a complete failure of functionality for valid inputs that causes the program to crash with a RecursionError.

3. The fix is trivial and correct: change `SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()` to `SparseArray(self.to_dense().cumsum())` or `type(self)(self.to_dense().cumsum())`. This ensures cumsum() is called on the numpy array returned by to_dense(), not on a new SparseArray. The bug report provides the exact correct fix, and my testing confirms it would work properly.
