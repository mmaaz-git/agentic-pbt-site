## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The methods `begin()` and `produce()` are intentionally declared as `cdef inline` in the Cython declaration file (Scanners.pxd), which means they are C-level methods not meant to be accessible from Python. This is a deliberate design choice for performance optimization in Cython. The docstring may be documenting the internal API for developers working on the Cython codebase itself, not the Python-accessible API. Since Cython is a specialized tool for writing C extensions, having C-only methods is expected behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The class docstring explicitly lists these methods under "Methods:" without any indication that they are internal or inaccessible from Python. Users reading the docstring would reasonably expect to be able to call these methods, especially since other methods listed in the same section (read(), position()) are accessible. The documentation creates a clear expectation that violates the actual behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
These methods are internal implementation details used only by the scanner machinery itself (as evidenced by self.begin() and self.produce() calls within the class). Users are meant to use the Begin action class instead of calling begin() directly. The performance benefits of keeping these as cdef inline methods likely outweigh the documentation confusion for a small number of users who might try to call them directly. Cython.Plex is a specialized internal component of Cython, not a general-purpose library.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Documentation accuracy is important, and having methods documented that cannot be called is a clear source of confusion. The fix is trivial - simply remove or clarify the documentation. This isn't about changing functionality but about making documentation match reality. The confusion could waste developers' time trying to use non-existent methods.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code is working as designed - the methods are internal C-level methods for performance. The real issue is that the docstring incorrectly suggests these are part of the public Python API. The solution is to update the docstring to either remove references to begin() and produce(), or clearly mark them as internal C-level methods not accessible from Python. The documentation should guide users to use the Begin action class instead.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The bug report frames this as a "contract violation" suggesting the methods should exist, not that the documentation should be fixed. The report provides two solutions, one of which involves implementing the methods as Python-accessible, suggesting the reporter sees this as more than just a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report's second suggested fix is to implement these methods as Python-accessible methods, which would be adding new functionality. Currently, users must use the Begin action class for state changes, and having direct method access would be a new feature. This would provide a more convenient API for users who want to interact with the scanner programmatically.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The methods are already documented as if they exist, so implementing them would be fixing a bug rather than adding a new feature. The functionality already exists internally; it's just not exposed. Features requests typically involve entirely new capabilities, not exposing existing internal functionality that's already documented.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The class docstring explicitly documents begin() and produce() as callable methods alongside read() and position(). This creates a clear API contract that the implementation violates. Users following the documentation will encounter AttributeError. The docstring makes no distinction between Python-accessible and C-only methods. This is a clear case where documented behavior doesn't match actual behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This appears to be an intentional design decision in Cython for performance optimization. The methods are implemented but deliberately kept at the C level using `cdef inline`. Cython is a specialized tool where such optimizations are expected. The methods are used internally by the scanner and were never intended for direct Python access. The Begin action class provides the intended way to change scanner state from Python.

## Overall consideration

Looking at all the evidence, this appears to be primarily a documentation issue rather than a functional bug. The methods begin() and produce() are implemented in the source code but are deliberately declared as `cdef inline` methods in the Cython declaration file, making them C-level methods that cannot be accessed from Python. This is a common pattern in Cython for performance-critical internal methods.

The scanner uses these methods internally (as seen in lines 105, 125, and 130 of Scanners.py), and users are expected to use the Begin action class for state changes rather than calling begin() directly. The produce() method is called internally when processing actions. This design makes sense for a high-performance lexical scanner where these operations happen frequently and benefit from C-level optimization.

The real issue is that the class docstring lists these methods without any indication that they are internal or inaccessible from Python, creating false expectations. This is a documentation problem, not a code bug. The most appropriate resolution would be to update the docstring to either remove references to these methods or clearly mark them as internal C-level methods, and potentially add documentation about using the Begin action class for state changes. This makes it a DOCUMENTATION_FIX rather than a BUG, since the code is working as designed and the issue is purely about misleading documentation.
