## Triage Analysis for SparseArray.nonzero() Bug Report

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug):
**Arguments for:**
- The current behavior is objectively incorrect when compared to NumPy's nonzero()
- SparseArray is documented to provide "nearly identical" behavior to dense arrays
- The method returns incorrect results for a fundamental operation (finding non-zero indices)
- The bug breaks consistency with NumPy, which pandas explicitly aims to maintain
- The fix is straightforward and logical - account for non-zero fill values

**Arguments against:**
- None found - the behavior is clearly incorrect

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments for:**
- Could argue the method lacks documentation, so behavior is undefined

**Arguments against:**
- NumPy compatibility is a stated goal of pandas sparse arrays
- The method name "nonzero" has well-established semantics from NumPy
- The current behavior is logically incorrect regardless of documentation

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments for:**
- Could be considered an edge case since most sparse arrays use fill_value=0

**Arguments against:**
- Non-zero fill values are explicitly supported by the API
- The bug causes silent data corruption (wrong indices returned)
- This is not obscure - it's a fundamental array operation

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments for:**
- Could argue that supporting non-zero fill values in nonzero() is a new feature

**Arguments against:**
- The method already exists and should work correctly
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities
- NumPy compatibility is an existing design goal, not a new feature

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments for:**
- The nonzero() method lacks documentation

**Arguments against:**
- The issue is not just missing documentation - the code behavior is incorrect
- Even if documented, returning wrong indices would still be a bug
- The fix requires code changes, not just documentation updates

### Final Assessment:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The nonzero() method returns objectively incorrect results when fill_value is non-zero. It violates the fundamental semantics of what "nonzero" means and breaks NumPy compatibility, which is a stated design goal of pandas sparse arrays. The issue causes silent data corruption by returning wrong indices.
