## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test 1: Hypothesis Property Test

The hypothesis test successfully reproduced the bug. When testing with random non-'d'/'s' unit values, the function NEVER raised an error. All invalid unit values were silently accepted and treated as 'd' (days).

Key finding: The function accepts ANY string value for unit (including empty string '') and treats anything that's not 's' as 'd'.

### Test 2: Specific Invalid Unit Values

Tested the following invalid unit values:
- Empty string ''
- 'day', 'days', 'sec', 'seconds' (common typos/variations)
- ' d', 'd ' (with spaces)
- 'D', 'S' (wrong case)
- '1' (random value)

Result: ALL invalid values were accepted without error and produced the same output as unit='d'.

### Test 3: Comparison with Valid Units

Valid unit='d' produces: datetime64[s] with dates starting from 1960-01-02
Valid unit='s' produces: datetime64[ms] with times starting from 1960-01-01 00:00:01

Invalid units produce the SAME result as unit='d'.

### Code Analysis

Looking at the implementation (lines 100-108):
```python
if unit == "s":
    # handle seconds case
else:
    # treats EVERYTHING else as 'd'
```

The bug is confirmed: The function uses `if unit == "s": ... else:` pattern, which means ANY value that's not exactly 's' is treated as 'd', including:
- Invalid strings
- Typos
- Empty strings
- None (would likely fail differently)
- Any other unexpected input

### Bug Report Accuracy

The bug report is ACCURATE in all its claims:
1. The function does silently treat invalid units as 'd'
2. It does not validate the unit parameter
3. The docstring does specify only {'d', 's'} as valid values
4. This is inconsistent behavior (though the claim about _parse_datetime couldn't be verified as that function doesn't exist)
