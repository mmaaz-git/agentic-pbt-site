PANDAS READ_CSV DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS

Based on review of the official pandas documentation, here are the key findings regarding separator behavior:

1. DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR FOR MULTI-CHARACTER SEPARATORS:
   The pandas documentation explicitly states: "separators longer than 1 character and different from '\s+' will be interpreted as regular expressions and will also force the use of the Python parsing engine."

   This is clearly documented in both the API reference and the user guide.

2. REGEX INTERPRETATION:
   The documentation states that the sep parameter accepts "Character or regex pattern to treat as the delimiter". When using multi-character separators with the Python engine, they are treated as regular expressions.

3. ENGINE REQUIREMENTS:
   - The C engine does not support regex separators and will raise a ValueError
   - Multi-character separators automatically force the use of the Python engine
   - This is documented behavior

4. WARNINGS ABOUT REGEX DELIMITERS:
   The documentation includes a note: "Note that regex delimiters are prone to ignoring quoted data."

5. WHAT IS NOT DOCUMENTED:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly warn users that special regex characters (|, +, *, ?, ., ^, $) in multi-character separators will be interpreted as regex patterns
   - The documentation does NOT provide guidance on escaping special characters when using them as literal separators
   - The documentation does NOT provide examples showing how to use special characters as literal separators
   - There are no examples showing the use of re.escape() or manual escaping for literal special character separators

6. DOCUMENTATION CLARITY:
   While the documentation states that multi-character separators are interpreted as regex, it does not make it clear that common separator choices like "||", "..", "++" will fail or produce unexpected results because they are invalid or problematic regex patterns.

CONCLUSION:
The behavior observed in the bug report is CONSISTENT with the documented behavior - multi-character separators ARE documented as being interpreted as regular expressions. However, the documentation lacks clarity about the implications of this design choice and does not provide guidance on handling common cases where users want literal special characters as separators.
