TRIAGE ANALYSIS
================

1. INVALID - Could this be invalid?
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - NaTType documentation doesn't explicitly state it should be a singleton
   - Documentation doesn't specify NaTType() should return pd.NaT
   - Behavior is not formally specified in documentation

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - NAType (similar class) is explicitly documented as a singleton
   - Both serve as missing value indicators with parallel APIs
   - Current behavior causes practical problems (identity checks fail)
   - pd.NaT exists as a singleton instance, but NaTType() doesn't return it

2. WONTFIX - Could this be won't fix?
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Changing behavior might break existing code that relies on new instances
   - Current behavior has existed for some time without major complaints
   - Users can use pd.NaT directly instead of NaTType()

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - Creates genuine memory inefficiency
   - Violates principle of least surprise (inconsistent with NAType)
   - Makes identity checks fail unexpectedly
   - No reasonable use case for creating multiple distinct NaT instances

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Could this be a feature request?
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Documentation doesn't specify singleton behavior, so adding it is a new feature
   - Could be seen as requesting new functionality not originally intended

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - NAType already implements this as expected behavior
   - This is more about fixing inconsistent behavior than adding features
   - Missing value indicators should logically be singletons

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Could this be a documentation issue?
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Documentation could be updated to clarify that NaTType creates new instances
   - Could document that users should use pd.NaT directly for singleton

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The current behavior is counterintuitive and problematic
   - NAType sets precedent that these should be singletons
   - Documentation fix alone wouldn't solve the practical issues

5. BUG - Could this be a valid bug?
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Inconsistent with NAType which serves the same purpose
   - Creates memory inefficiency (multiple objects for same concept)
   - Breaks identity checks (value is pd.NaT fails)
   - No valid use case for non-singleton behavior
   - Similar missing value indicators (pd.NA, None) are singletons
   - Violates principle of least surprise

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - Not explicitly documented as singleton requirement

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
The strongest case is for BUG. While documentation doesn't explicitly require singleton behavior, the parallel NAType class establishes clear precedent. Missing value indicators should be singletons for both conceptual clarity and practical efficiency. The current behavior causes real problems (identity check failures, memory waste) with no offsetting benefits.
