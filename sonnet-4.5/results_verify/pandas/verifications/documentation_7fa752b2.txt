DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Method Signature and Documentation:
   - The isin method signature: `isin(self, values: ArrayLike) -> npt.NDArray[np.bool_]`
   - Docstring states: "values : np.ndarray or ExtensionArray"
   - ArrayLike in pandas is defined as Union[ExtensionArray, np.ndarray]

2. Official Pandas Documentation:
   - The official pandas documentation for ExtensionArray.isin shows an example using a list: `arr.isin([1])`
   - This clearly demonstrates that lists are expected to be accepted inputs
   - The documentation describes it as "Roughly equivalent to np.array([x in values for x in self])"

3. API Consistency:
   - Other ExtensionArray subclasses (IntegerArray, FloatingArray, BooleanArray) all accept lists
   - MaskedArray.isin() explicitly converts input to array: `values_arr = np.asarray(values)`
   - This establishes a clear precedent that lists should be accepted

4. User Expectations:
   - The Python "in" operator naturally works with lists
   - numpy.isin() accepts lists as input
   - The documentation example shows a list being used
   - Other pandas ExtensionArrays accept lists

5. Conclusion:
   The documentation and examples clearly show that lists should be accepted as valid input to the isin() method. The current implementation's failure to handle lists is inconsistent with:
   - The documentation's own examples
   - The behavior of other ExtensionArray implementations
   - Standard Python and NumPy conventions

   This is not a case of unspecified behavior - the documentation explicitly shows list usage in its example.
