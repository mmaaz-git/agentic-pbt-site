## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation for BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments For:**
- The function crashes with `TokenError` when given null bytes, violating its documented promise to return names unmodified when conversion fails
- The docstring explicitly states the function should handle conversion failures gracefully
- The implementation only catches `SyntaxError` but Python's tokenizer can raise `TokenError` (not a subclass)
- This is a clear mismatch between documented behavior and actual behavior
- The proposed fix is minimal and correct - just add `tokenize.TokenError` to the exception handler
- Real-world impact: Column names in data processing could legitimately contain null bytes from various sources (corrupted data, binary data, etc.)

**Arguments Against:**
- None. This is a clear violation of the documented contract.

### Evaluation for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- None. The bug is reproducible and violates documented behavior.

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation clearly promises to return names unmodified when they cannot be converted
- The crash is not the expected or documented behavior
- The test case uses valid Python strings (containing null bytes is valid for Python strings)

### Evaluation for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Null bytes in column names are unusual and might be considered an edge case

**Arguments Against:**
- The function explicitly documents that it should handle ALL cases where conversion fails
- Null bytes can appear in real data, especially when processing binary data or corrupted files
- The fix is trivial (adding one exception type to the catch clause)
- This breaks the idempotence property that users might rely on
- Crashes are generally more severe than returning data unchanged

### Evaluation for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- One could argue the documentation should specify it only catches `SyntaxError`

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation's intent is clear: handle failures gracefully
- The documentation doesn't limit itself to specific exception types
- Changing documentation to match buggy behavior would be backwards
- The code should implement what the documentation promises, not vice versa

### Evaluation for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- None. This isn't requesting new functionality.

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation already promises this behavior
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The function is supposed to handle this case according to its own documentation

### Conclusion
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The function violates its documented contract by crashing instead of returning the name unmodified when tokenization fails with a `TokenError`. The fix is straightforward and maintains backward compatibility while fulfilling the documented promise.
