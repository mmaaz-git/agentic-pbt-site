## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Case 1: Primary Bug Scenario
**Input:**
- cat_a: values=['a'], categories=['a']
- cat_b: values=['a', 'b\x00'], categories=['a', 'b\x00']
- cat_c: values=['b'], categories=['b']

**Expected Result:**
- Categories: ['a', 'b\x00', 'b'] (all unique categories preserved)
- Values: ['a', 'a', 'b\x00', 'b'] (all values preserved)

**Actual Result:**
- Categories: ['a', 'b\x00'] (missing 'b')
- Values: ['a', 'a', 'b\x00', nan] (last value converted to NaN)

**Verification:** The bug is CONFIRMED. Category 'b' is dropped and its value is converted to NaN.

### Test Case 2: Hypothesis Failing Input
**Input:**
- cat1: values=['0'], categories=['0']
- cat2: values=['0', '1\x00'], categories=['0', '1\x00']
- cat3: values=['1'], categories=['1']

**Expected Result:**
- Categories: ['0', '1\x00', '1']
- Values: ['0', '0', '1\x00', '1']

**Actual Result:**
- Categories: ['0', '1\x00'] (missing '1')
- Values: ['0', '0', '1\x00', nan]

**Verification:** The bug is CONFIRMED with the exact input from hypothesis testing.

### Test Case 3: Two Categoricals Only
When combining just cat_b and cat_c (without cat_a):
- Result categories: ['a', 'b\x00', 'b']
- Result values: ['a', 'b\x00', 'b']

**Important:** This works CORRECTLY! All categories are preserved when combining just two categoricals.

### Test Case 4: Different Order
When combining in reverse order [cat_c, cat_b, cat_a]:
- Result categories: ['b', 'a'] (missing 'b\x00')
- Result values: ['b', 'a', nan, 'a']

**Observation:** The bug manifests differently with different orderings, but still loses categories.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test successfully found the failure with the minimal example. The test confirms that `union_categoricals` does not preserve all unique categories as it should according to set union semantics.

### Critical Findings:
1. The bug is REPRODUCIBLE and CONSISTENT
2. The bug only occurs with 3+ categoricals in specific patterns
3. The bug causes DATA LOSS (categories dropped, values become NaN)
4. The behavior is ORDER-DEPENDENT (different orders produce different missing categories)
5. Two-categorical unions work correctly, suggesting the bug is in the iterative merging logic

### Pattern Analysis:
The bug appears when:
- First categorical has category 'X'
- Second categorical has both 'X' and 'Y\x00' (with null byte or similar special character)
- Third categorical has category 'Y' (similar to but different from 'Y\x00')

This suggests a potential issue with how pandas handles string comparison or category merging when special characters are involved in a multi-step union operation.
