BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is confirmed to exist.

TEST EXECUTION RESULTS:
-----------------------

1. Basic Reproduction Test:
   - Created a function with a docstring that lacks a blank line after the summary
   - The deprecate function ACCEPTED this malformed docstring (BUG CONFIRMED)
   - Expected behavior: Should have raised an AssertionError

2. Hypothesis Test:
   - The property-based test failed as expected, confirming systematic failure
   - Multiple examples of malformed docstrings were accepted when they should have been rejected
   - Test failure proves that deprecate() does not properly validate docstring format

3. Edge Case Testing:
   - Docstring with no blank line after summary: INCORRECTLY ACCEPTED (Bug confirmed)
   - Docstring with no initial blank line: Correctly rejected
   - Docstring with no summary: INCORRECTLY ACCEPTED (Additional bug found)
   - Properly formatted docstring: Correctly accepted

SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS:
---------------------

The bug is located in line 84 of /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/util/_decorators.py:

```python
if empty1 or empty2 and not summary:
    raise AssertionError(doc_error_msg)
```

Due to Python operator precedence, this evaluates as:
```python
if empty1 or (empty2 and not summary):
```

This means the check only fails when:
1. empty1 is truthy (first line after quotes is not empty), OR
2. empty2 is truthy AND summary is falsy (no summary exists)

The bug occurs because when:
- empty1 is "" (empty, which is correct)
- summary is "Summary line" (truthy, exists)
- empty2 is "Next line" (not empty, which is incorrect)

The condition evaluates to: False or (True and False) = False
So no error is raised despite the malformed docstring.

IMPACT:
-------
The deprecate function fails to enforce its documented requirement that docstrings must have:
1. Opening quotes on their own line
2. A one-line summary
3. A blank line after the summary (for multi-line docstrings)

This allows incorrectly formatted docstrings to pass validation, potentially causing issues with automatic documentation generation tools that expect properly formatted NumPy-style docstrings.
