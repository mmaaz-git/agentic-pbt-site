## Reproduction Analysis

### Technical Verification
I successfully reproduced the bug report's findings:
1. `_range2cols('A:C,B:D')` returns `[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` with duplicates
2. `_range2cols('A,A,A')` returns `[0, 0, 0]` with tripled column
3. `_range2cols('A,B,C,B:D')` returns `[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` with duplicates
4. The hypothesis test fails for overlapping ranges as reported

### Current Implementation Behavior
The `_range2cols` function currently:
- Splits the input string by commas
- For each segment, either appends a single column index or extends with a range
- Returns the list without deduplication
- This results in duplicate indices when ranges overlap or columns are repeated

### Downstream Handling
Importantly, I discovered that the duplicate indices from `_range2cols` are handled later in the processing pipeline:
- In `pandas/io/parsers/base_parser.py` line 1040, the usecols list is converted to a set: `usecols = set(usecols)`
- This automatically removes duplicates before the columns are actually selected
- As a result, `pd.read_excel(filename, usecols='A:C,B:D')` correctly returns columns A, B, C, D without duplicates

### End-to-End Testing
When testing the complete Excel reading flow:
- Input: Excel file with columns A, B, C, D, E
- Using `usecols='A:C,B:D'`: Results in columns [A, B, C, D] - no duplicates
- Using `usecols='A,A,A'`: Results in column [A] - no duplicates
- The deduplication happens downstream, so users don't see duplicate columns

### Performance Consideration
While the duplicates are handled later:
1. The intermediate list with duplicates uses more memory than necessary
2. The conversion to set happens regardless of whether duplicates exist
3. For large ranges with significant overlap, this could create unnecessarily large intermediate lists

### Conclusion
The bug report is technically correct that `_range2cols` returns duplicate indices. However, these duplicates are removed later in the processing pipeline before affecting the final result. Users never actually get duplicate columns in their DataFrame.
