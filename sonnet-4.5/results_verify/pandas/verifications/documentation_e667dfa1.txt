# Documentation Analysis

## CSS Specification Review

### W3C CSS Values and Units Module Level 4
The official CSS specification explicitly states:
"When written literally, a number is either an integer, or zero or more decimal digits followed by a dot (.) followed by one or more decimal digits; optionally, it can be concluded by the letter 'e' or 'E' followed by an integer indicating the base-ten exponent in scientific notation."

This confirms that scientific notation is a valid and standard part of CSS numeric values.

### Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Documentation
MDN documentation on CSS `<number>` type confirms:
- "A <number> can also end with the letter e or E followed by an integer, which indicates a base-ten exponent in scientific notation."
- Examples: "10e3" (representing 10,000), "-3.4e-2" (representing -0.034)

### Pandas Documentation
The `size_to_pt` function has minimal documentation:
- Function signature shows it accepts `in_val` parameter
- No explicit documentation about scientific notation support or limitations
- No warning that scientific notation is unsupported

## Key Findings

1. **CSS Standards Compliance**: Scientific notation is explicitly part of the CSS specification for numeric values. Any CSS parser should handle it correctly.

2. **Expected Behavior**: Based on CSS specifications, values like "1e-10pt" should be parsed as:
   - Number: 1e-10 (0.0000000001)
   - Unit: pt

3. **Documentation Gap**: The pandas function doesn't document any limitations regarding scientific notation, implying it should follow CSS standards.

4. **Purpose of Function**: The function is part of CSS utilities for "interpreting CSS from Stylers for formatting non-HTML outputs," which suggests it should follow CSS specifications.

## Conclusion
The documentation strongly supports that this is a legitimate bug. Scientific notation is a standard part of CSS numeric values according to W3C specifications, and the pandas CSS parser should handle it correctly to be compliant with CSS standards.
