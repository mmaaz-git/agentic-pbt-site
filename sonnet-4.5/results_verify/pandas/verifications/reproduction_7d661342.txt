REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - The Hypothesis test failed exactly as described with n=2
   - Error message: "NaTType() should be a singleton (like NAType), but got different instances"
   - The test correctly identifies that multiple calls to NaTType() create different instances

2. SIMPLE TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - NAType() is singleton: True (works as expected)
   - NaTType() is singleton: False (confirms the bug)

3. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:
   - NaTType() instances are NOT the same as pd.NaT (NaTType() is pd.NaT: False)
   - NAType() instances ARE the same as pd.NA (NAType() is pd.NA: True)
   - Multiple NaTType() instances:
     * Are not identical (nat3 is nat4: False)
     * Are not equal (nat3 == nat4: False) - due to NaN-like semantics
     * Have identical hashes (hash(nat3) == hash(nat4): True)

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   - NAType is implemented in pandas._libs.missing (Cython module)
   - NaTType is implemented in pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype (Cython module)
   - Both are C extensions, which explains why we can't easily inspect the source

The bug is confirmed: NaTType() creates new instances on each call rather than returning a singleton like NAType() does. This is an inconsistency in the API where two similar missing value types have different constructor behaviors.
