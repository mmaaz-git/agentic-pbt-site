## Documentation Analysis for fill_mi_header

### Function Documentation

The function `fill_mi_header` in `pandas/io/excel/_util.py` has the following docstring:

```
Forward fill blank entries in row but only inside the same parent index.

Used for creating headers in Multiindex.

Parameters
----------
row : list
    List of items in a single row.
control_row : list of bool
    Helps to determine if particular column is in same parent index as the
    previous value. Used to stop propagation of empty cells between
    different indexes.

Returns
-------
Returns changed row and control_row
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Purpose**: The function explicitly states it should "forward fill blank entries in row"
2. **Scope**: Forward filling should occur "only inside the same parent index"
3. **Control Mechanism**: The `control_row` parameter determines parent index boundaries
4. **Blank Entries**: The documentation clearly indicates that blank entries (None or empty string) should be filled

### Usage Context

The function is used in `pandas/io/excel/_base.py` when parsing Excel files with MultiIndex headers. When Excel files have merged cells in headers, this function ensures that blank cells get filled with the appropriate value from the last non-blank cell within the same parent index.

### Expected Behavior from Documentation

Based on the documentation:
1. Blank entries (None or empty string) should be forward-filled with the last non-blank value
2. The control_row determines boundaries - when False, it indicates a potential boundary
3. Forward filling should continue until a new boundary is encountered

### Actual Implementation Issue

The current implementation has a logic flaw:
- When `control_row[i]` is False, it unconditionally sets `last = row[i]`
- If `row[i]` is None at that position, it sets `last = None`
- This breaks the forward-fill chain because subsequent None values will be "filled" with None

### Documentation Verdict

The documentation is clear and unambiguous: the function should "forward fill blank entries". The current implementation fails to do this when a blank entry coincides with a False value in control_row. The bug report correctly identifies a violation of the documented behavior.

The documentation does NOT specify that blank values at boundaries should reset the forward-fill value. It only says that control_row helps "stop propagation of empty cells between different indexes" - meaning it should prevent filling across boundaries, not that it should reset the fill value to None.
