DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.mean()

OFFICIAL PANDAS DOCUMENTATION:
The official pandas documentation for GroupBy.mean() states:
- "Compute mean of groups, excluding missing values"
- Accepts parameters for numeric_only, engine (cython/numba), and engine_kwargs
- Returns DataFrame or Series with mean of values within each group

KEY FINDING: The documentation does NOT specify:
1. Expected behavior regarding numerical precision
2. Guarantees about floating-point accuracy
3. Constraints that mean must fall between min and max values
4. Behavior when all values in a group are identical
5. Any warnings about potential floating-point accumulation errors

RELATED DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:

1. GROUPBY USER GUIDE:
- No mention of numerical precision issues in groupby operations
- Shows one indirect example with floating-point approximation (std calculation showing -4.870756e-16)
- Focus is on functionality rather than numerical accuracy guarantees

2. GITHUB ISSUE #22240:
- Documents known precision differences between pandas groupby mean and numpy mean
- Pandas maintainer acknowledged this as "limitations of floating point precision"
- Issue was closed as "Usage Question" rather than a bug
- Suggests this type of precision issue is considered expected behavior

3. MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION OF MEAN:
- Standard mathematical definition: mean of identical values equals those values
- Mathematical invariant: min ≤ mean ≤ max for any set of real numbers
- These are fundamental properties not explicitly stated but universally expected

DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
The documentation lacks:
1. Warning about potential floating-point precision issues
2. Explanation of the summation algorithm used (which affects precision)
3. Guidance on when to use higher precision dtypes for better accuracy
4. Clarification that mathematical invariants may be violated due to floating-point arithmetic

CONCLUSION:
While the documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee that mean will respect the min ≤ mean ≤ max invariant, this is a fundamental mathematical property that users would reasonably expect to hold. The violation of this property, even by tiny amounts, could be considered either:
- A BUG: Because it violates basic mathematical expectations
- A DOCUMENTATION_FIX: Because the limitation should be documented
- WONTFIX: If considered an acceptable floating-point precision limitation
