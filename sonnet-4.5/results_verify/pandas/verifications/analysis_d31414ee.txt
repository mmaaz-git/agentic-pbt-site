BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - The function explicitly promises uniqueness preservation in its docstring
   - The promise has no stated exceptions or caveats
   - The failing inputs (0.0 and 1.175494351e-38) are valid floats in [0,1]
   - The function accepts these inputs without error
   - The docstring creates a contract that the implementation violates

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The failing cases involve extremely small values (1e-38 and smaller)
   - These values are at the edge of numerical precision capabilities
   - The issue is fundamentally due to IEEE 754 limitations, not a coding error

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Values like 1e-38 as percentiles are extremely unrealistic in practice
   - No real-world use case would have percentiles differing by 1e-38
   - The issue only affects values far beyond practical precision needs
   - Fixing this would require arbitrary precision arithmetic, adding complexity

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The function makes an explicit, unconditional promise
   - Property-based testing legitimately found a contract violation
   - Even if rare, the function should honor its documented behavior

3. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Could argue these extreme values are outside "reasonable" use
   - Floating-point limitations are well-known in numerical computing

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The docstring makes no mention of "reasonable" ranges
   - The function accepts these values without raising an error
   - The inputs are technically valid according to the stated constraints

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality needed)
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - Supporting extreme precision would be a new capability
   - Could request arbitrary precision arithmetic support

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The docstring already claims this functionality exists
   - This is about fixing existing behavior, not adding new features

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation needs updating)
   ARGUMENTS FOR:
   - The code behaves reasonably given floating-point limitations
   - The docstring overpromises what's numerically possible
   - Adding a caveat about precision limits would align docs with reality
   - The function works correctly for all practical use cases
   - This is fundamentally a documentation issue, not a code issue

   ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
   - The code could be modified to handle edge cases better
   - Some might expect the code to match the documentation

DETAILED ASSESSMENT:

The core issue is that the docstring makes an absolute mathematical promise that is
impossible to fulfill with IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic. The function works
correctly for all realistic percentile values but fails for extremely small values
that exceed numerical precision capabilities.

Key considerations:
1. The values causing failures (1e-38 and smaller) are not realistic percentiles
2. The underlying cause is fundamental floating-point precision limits
3. The proposed fix (capping precision at 15) doesn't actually solve the problem
4. The function behaves correctly for all practical use cases
5. The documentation creates an impossible-to-fulfill expectation

This is fundamentally a case where the documentation overpromises. The code's behavior
is reasonable and correct within the constraints of floating-point arithmetic. The
documentation should be updated to reflect these inherent limitations rather than
claiming an absolute property that cannot be guaranteed.
