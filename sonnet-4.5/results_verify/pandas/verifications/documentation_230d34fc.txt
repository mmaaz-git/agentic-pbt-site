DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

SOURCE:
-------
The code is vendored from the PyPA packaging library (https://github.com/pypa/packaging)
Changeset: ae891fd74d6dd4c6063bb04f2faeadaac6fc6313 (04/30/2021)

DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:
----------------------
1. No explicit documentation found in pandas about these InfinityType classes
2. These are internal implementation details vendored from the packaging library
3. The code comments indicate it's used for version comparison sorting

UPSTREAM STATUS:
---------------
The current upstream packaging library (checked via WebFetch) has the SAME implementation,
indicating this behavior exists in the original source as well.

MATHEMATICAL INTENT:
-------------------
The InfinityType and NegativeInfinityType are designed to represent mathematical infinity
values for version comparison purposes. They are used in version sorting to represent:
- Infinity: A value greater than any other value
- NegativeInfinity: A value less than any other value

COMPARISON SEMANTICS:
--------------------
The current implementation tries to make:
- Infinity > everything (including itself apparently)
- NegativeInfinity < everything (including itself apparently)

However, this violates Python's standard comparison operator semantics where:
- The <= operator means "less than OR equal to"
- The >= operator means "greater than OR equal to"
- If x == x, then by definition x <= x and x >= x must both be True

PYTHON'S BUILT-IN BEHAVIOR:
---------------------------
Python's float('inf') and float('-inf') correctly implement these semantics:
- float('inf') == float('inf') returns True
- float('inf') <= float('inf') returns True
- float('inf') >= float('inf') returns True

CONCLUSION:
----------
There is no documentation that explicitly states InfinityType should violate standard
comparison operator semantics. The implementation appears to be an oversight where the
developers wanted Infinity to be "greater than everything" but didn't account for the
reflexivity requirement when comparing with itself.
