## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation for FixedForwardWindowIndexer
According to the pandas documentation:
- **Class Description**: "Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row."
- **Parameters**: The documentation shows `window_size` with a default of 0, but does NOT specify constraints or requirements
- **Example**: Shows usage with `window_size=2` (a positive value)

### Source Code Documentation
From the source code docstring:
- The class inherits from BaseIndexer
- The docstring describes it as creating "fixed-length windows"
- No explicit mention of window_size constraints in the class-level documentation

### Related Functions and Consistency

1. **Standard pandas rolling()**:
   - Validates window parameter: "window must be an integer 0 or greater"
   - Raises ValueError for negative window sizes
   - This establishes a clear precedent for window size validation

2. **BaseIndexer class**:
   - The parent class defines window_size parameter with default=0
   - No validation in the base class __init__ method
   - Expects subclasses to implement get_window_bounds appropriately

3. **FixedWindowIndexer** (internal class, not in public API):
   - Similar implementation pattern
   - Also does not validate negative window sizes in its implementation
   - But this is an internal class not exposed in pandas.api.indexers

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **No explicit constraint documented**: The documentation does not explicitly state that window_size must be non-negative
2. **Semantic expectation**: The term "fixed-length windows" strongly implies a positive length - negative lengths are nonsensical
3. **Consistency expectation**: Users would reasonably expect consistent behavior with pandas.rolling() which validates window >= 0
4. **Example only shows positive**: Documentation example uses window_size=2, never demonstrating or discussing negative values

### Window Bounds Invariant
While not explicitly documented for FixedForwardWindowIndexer, the fundamental invariant that start[i] <= end[i] is:
- Mathematically necessary for valid window definitions
- Implicitly assumed throughout pandas windowing operations
- Required for correct slicing operations (slice[start:end] assumes start <= end)

### Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly forbid negative window sizes, but:
1. The semantic meaning of "fixed-length windows" implies non-negative lengths
2. Consistency with pandas.rolling() creates a reasonable expectation of validation
3. The mathematical invariant start <= end is fundamental to window operations
4. Negative window sizes produce nonsensical results that violate core assumptions
