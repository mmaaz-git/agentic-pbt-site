## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function could be argued to work as designed if the intent was to be lenient about file detection. Some might claim that using substring matching is a deliberate design choice to handle files with non-standard naming conventions or to be more flexible in file detection.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states that format is "inferred from file extension," and "file extension" has a well-defined meaning in computing - it's the suffix after the last dot in a filename. The current implementation directly violates this documented behavior. Files like "file.xpt0" or "data.xpt.backup" should not be detected as SAS files according to the documentation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue this is an edge case that rarely occurs in practice. Most users wouldn't name their files with embedded extensions like "file.xpt0" or "data.sas7bdat.backup". The current lenient behavior might even be helping some users who have oddly named files.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial edge case - backup files (like .xpt.backup) are common in real-world scenarios. The bug causes actual errors that confuse users, as the function attempts to parse non-SAS files as SAS formats, resulting in cryptic error messages like "Header record is not an XPORT file" instead of the clearer "unable to infer format." This impacts user experience and debugging.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the developers intended the substring matching behavior, then the documentation is wrong and should be updated to say "inferred from filename containing '.xpt' or '.sas7bdat'" rather than "inferred from file extension."

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation's phrasing about "file extension" is clear and standard. File extensions are universally understood to be the suffix at the end of filenames. The code implementation appears to be the mistake here, not the documentation. The fix is straightforward and makes the code match the documented behavior.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that proper extension checking is a new feature that the original implementation didn't have, and the bug reporter is requesting an enhancement to make the function more strict in its file detection.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not a request for new functionality - the documentation already promises that format is inferred from "file extension." The code simply doesn't implement what's documented. This is a bug where the implementation doesn't match the specification, not a request for new behavior.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation clearly states the format is inferred from the "file extension," which has a specific meaning in computing. The implementation uses substring matching instead, causing files with embedded extensions (like backup files or versioned files) to be incorrectly identified as SAS files. This leads to confusing error messages and unexpected behavior that violates the documented contract. The fix is simple and makes the code consistent with the documentation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if the substring matching was an intentional design decision to be more lenient. However, there's no evidence of this intent in the documentation or code comments, and the resulting behavior causes actual problems for users with legitimately named files like backups.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a valid BUG. The documentation explicitly promises that the format will be inferred from the "file extension" when format=None. In standard computing terminology, a file extension is the suffix after the last dot in a filename (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .xpt). The current implementation violates this documented behavior by using substring matching (`".xpt" in fname`) instead of proper extension checking (`fname.endswith(".xpt")`).

This bug has real-world implications. Files with names like "data.xpt.backup", "file.sas7bdat.old", or "report.xpt0" are incorrectly identified as SAS files, leading to confusing error messages when the parser fails. Instead of getting the clear "unable to infer format" error, users see cryptic messages like "Header record is not an XPORT file" or "magic number mismatch," making debugging difficult.

The suggested fix is correct and straightforward: replace the substring matching with proper extension checking using `endswith()`. This would make the implementation match the documented behavior and prevent false positive detections on files that merely contain the extension strings somewhere in their names. This is not an enhancement or new feature - it's fixing the code to work as documented.
