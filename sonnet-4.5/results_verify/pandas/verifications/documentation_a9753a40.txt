DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. METHOD DOCSTRING:
   The cumsum method has the following docstring in the source code:

   """
   Cumulative sum of non-NA/null values.

   When performing the cumulative summation, any non-NA/null values will
   be skipped. The resulting SparseArray will preserve the locations of
   NaN values, but the fill value will be `np.nan` regardless.

   Parameters
   ----------
   axis : int or None
       Axis over which to perform the cumulative summation. If None,
       perform cumulative summation over flattened array.

   Returns
   -------
   cumsum : SparseArray
   """

2. DOCUMENTATION EXPECTATIONS:
   - The docstring states cumsum should compute "Cumulative sum of non-NA/null values"
   - It mentions NaN values will be skipped/preserved
   - It says "the fill value will be `np.nan` regardless"
   - The method should return a SparseArray

3. IMPLEMENTATION vs DOCUMENTATION:
   The documentation does NOT specify:
   - What happens when fill_value is not NaN/None (e.g., when fill_value=0)
   - That the behavior differs based on whether fill_value is considered "null" or not
   - Any restrictions on which fill_values are supported

4. PUBLIC API DOCUMENTATION:
   - The pandas.arrays.SparseArray public documentation does not provide specific
     details about the cumsum method behavior
   - There's no explicit statement about fill_value restrictions

5. MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS:
   - Cumulative sum is a well-defined mathematical operation
   - For array [1, 0, 2, 0, 3], cumsum should produce [1, 1, 3, 3, 6]
   - This is standard behavior across numpy, pandas Series, and other array libraries

6. USER EXPECTATIONS:
   - Users would reasonably expect cumsum() to work on any valid SparseArray
   - SparseArray([1, 0, 2, 0, 3]) is a completely valid sparse array
   - There's no reason to expect this would cause a crash
   - The default fill_value for integer arrays is 0, so this affects the default case

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not warn users that cumsum will fail for non-null fill values.
The crash is not expected behavior based on the documentation. The method should either:
1. Work correctly for all valid SparseArrays, or
2. Clearly document which fill_values are not supported and raise a meaningful error

A RecursionError is never acceptable behavior for a public API method on valid input.
