TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluation of each possible categorization:

1. BUG - Arguments FOR:
   ✓ The behavior is inconsistent - positive integers hash the same across dtypes, negative don't
   ✓ Violates the principle of value-based hashing that users expect
   ✓ The documentation says "deterministic integers" without mentioning dtype-dependency
   ✓ Real-world impact on deduplication, grouping, and comparison operations
   ✓ The asymmetry between positive and negative values is clearly unintentional
   ✓ No reasonable use case would require different hashes for -1 as int32 vs int64
   ✓ The example in documentation uses simple integers without dtype specification

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Could argue the function is technically "deterministic" (same input bytes = same output)
   - Implementation directly hashes byte representation, which is working as coded

2. INVALID - Arguments FOR:
   - The code is working exactly as implemented (hashing raw bytes)
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly promise dtype-independence

   Arguments AGAINST:
   ✓ The inconsistency between positive and negative values proves this is not intended behavior
   ✓ Users have reasonable expectations that values should hash consistently
   ✓ The bug causes real problems in practice
   ✓ "Deterministic" in documentation implies value-based, not representation-based

3. WONTFIX - Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue changing this might break backward compatibility
   - The issue only affects negative numbers

   Arguments AGAINST:
   ✓ This is not an obscure edge case - negative numbers are common
   ✓ The inconsistency affects core pandas operations (groupby, merge, drop_duplicates)
   ✓ The asymmetry between positive/negative is clearly wrong
   ✓ This is a correctness issue, not a minor inconvenience

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments FOR:
   - Could document that hashes are dtype-dependent
   - Would preserve backward compatibility

   Arguments AGAINST:
   ✓ The inconsistent behavior (positive vs negative) suggests a bug, not a feature
   ✓ No reasonable use case requires dtype-dependent hashing
   ✓ Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
   ✓ Users need value-based hashing for practical applications

5. FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments FOR:
   - Could frame as "add support for dtype-independent hashing"

   Arguments AGAINST:
   ✓ This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
   ✓ The current behavior is inconsistent and unexpected
   ✓ Value-based hashing is the expected default, not a new feature

DECISION RATIONALE:
-------------------
This is clearly a BUG because:

1. The behavior is INCONSISTENT - positive values hash the same across dtypes while negative
   values don't. This asymmetry cannot be intentional design.

2. It violates fundamental hashing principles - equal values should produce equal hashes.

3. The documentation implies value-based hashing with "deterministic integers" but doesn't
   warn about dtype-dependency.

4. There's no reasonable use case where you'd want -1 to hash differently based on dtype
   while 1 hashes the same.

5. The root cause (viewing bytes directly without normalization) explains why it happens
   but doesn't justify the behavior.

6. It has real impact on pandas operations that rely on hashing for correctness.

This is not INVALID because the expectation of consistent hashing is reasonable.
This is not WONTFIX because it affects common use cases with negative numbers.
This is not DOCUMENTATION_FIX because the inconsistent behavior is clearly wrong.
This is not FEATURE_REQUEST because it's fixing broken behavior, not adding features.
