## Documentation Analysis for pandas.qcut

### Official Documentation Review

The pandas.qcut documentation describes the function as:
- "Quantile-based discretization function"
- "Discretize variable into equal-sized buckets based on rank or based on sample quantiles"

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Input Requirements**:
   - Accepts "1d ndarray or Series"
   - No explicit mention of value range limitations
   - No mention of handling subnormal floats or extreme values

2. **Error Handling Documented**:
   - ValueError for non-unique bin edges (controllable via 'duplicates' parameter)
   - Out of bounds values become NA
   - No mention of numerical precision issues or extreme value handling

3. **Precision Parameter**:
   - Documented as "The precision at which to store and display the bins labels"
   - Default value is 3
   - No warnings about limitations with extreme values

4. **What's NOT Documented**:
   - No mention of limitations with subnormal floating-point numbers
   - No warning about numerical instability with extreme dynamic ranges
   - No documentation about the "invalid value encountered in divide" warnings
   - No mention of the misleading "missing values" error that can occur
   - No guidance on acceptable value ranges

### Related Issues and Context

From GitHub issues and Stack Overflow:
- Known precision parameter issues (#32127, #33912)
- Known issues with error messages being unclear (#13318)
- Community discussions show precision problems with extreme values
- No official documentation acknowledges these limitations

### Documentation Gap Assessment

The documentation does NOT specify:
1. That the function may fail with subnormal floats
2. That extreme dynamic ranges can cause numerical instability
3. That very small values mixed with normal values can trigger errors
4. Any limitations on the magnitude of input values

Since the documentation accepts "1d ndarray" without qualification, users would reasonably expect it to handle all valid floating-point values, including subnormal ones. The fact that it crashes with a confusing error message instead of either:
a) Handling these values correctly, or
b) Providing a clear, documented limitation

represents either a bug in the implementation or a documentation deficiency.
