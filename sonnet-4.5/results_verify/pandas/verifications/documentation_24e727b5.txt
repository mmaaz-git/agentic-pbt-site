DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS: pandas.plotting.bootstrap_plot

1. FUNCTION DOCSTRING:
   From pandas.plotting.bootstrap_plot docstring:
   "The bootstrap plot is used to estimate the uncertainty of a statistic by relying
   on random sampling with replacement"

   KEY PHRASE: "random sampling WITH REPLACEMENT" - explicitly documented

2. WIKIPEDIA REFERENCE:
   The docstring references: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)

   Wikipedia states:
   - "Bootstrapping is a procedure for estimating the distribution of an estimator
     by resampling (often with replacement) one's data"
   - "A key result in Efron's seminal paper that introduced the bootstrap is the
     favorable performance of bootstrap methods using sampling with replacement"

   This confirms bootstrapping fundamentally requires sampling WITH replacement

3. PARAMETER DOCUMENTATION:
   - size: "Number of data points to consider during each sampling. It must be less
           than or equal to the length of the series."
   - The constraint "less than or equal to" makes sense for WITH replacement sampling
   - For WITHOUT replacement, this is a hard requirement, not just a recommendation

4. STATISTICAL LITERATURE:
   Bootstrap methodology, as defined by Bradley Efron (1979), specifically requires:
   - Sampling WITH replacement from the original dataset
   - This allows the same observation to appear multiple times in a bootstrap sample
   - This is essential for correctly estimating the sampling distribution

5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   Based on all documentation:
   - The function MUST sample WITH replacement
   - Each bootstrap sample should potentially contain duplicate values
   - The current implementation violates the documented behavior

CONCLUSION: The documentation is crystal clear - the function promises to perform
"random sampling with replacement" but the implementation uses random.sample() which
samples WITHOUT replacement. This is a direct contradiction between documented and
actual behavior.
