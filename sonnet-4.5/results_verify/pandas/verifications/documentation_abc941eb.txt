# Documentation Analysis for FixedForwardWindowIndexer

## Class Documentation

The `FixedForwardWindowIndexer` class is documented as:
"Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row."

Key documentation points:
1. The class inherits from `BaseIndexer`
2. It takes a `window_size` parameter (type: int, default: 0)
3. The purpose is to create forward-looking windows that include the current row

## Method Documentation

The `get_window_bounds` method documentation states:
- Parameters include `window_size` described as "the number of rows in a window"
- Returns "A tuple of ndarray[int64]s, indicating the boundaries of each window"

## Constraints and Validation

From the source code implementation (lines 331-336), we see explicit validation for:
1. `center` parameter: Raises ValueError if center=True with message "Forward-looking windows can't have center=True"
2. `closed` parameter: Raises ValueError if closed is not None with message "Forward-looking windows don't support setting the closed argument"

**Critical finding**: There is NO validation for negative window_size values in the implementation.

## Implementation Details

The implementation (lines 340-345):
```python
start = np.arange(0, num_values, step, dtype="int64")
end = start + self.window_size
if self.window_size:
    end = np.clip(end, 0, num_values)
```

When `window_size` is negative:
- `start` is [0, 1, ...]
- `end = start + window_size` becomes `start + negative_value`, resulting in `end < start`
- The clipping only happens if `window_size` is truthy (non-zero), so negative values are clipped

## Example in Documentation

The provided example shows `window_size=2` (positive value) and demonstrates the expected forward-looking behavior.

## What the Documentation Does NOT Say

1. The documentation does NOT explicitly state that window_size must be non-negative
2. The documentation does NOT define expected behavior for negative window_size
3. The parameter type is simply "int", not "non-negative int" or "positive int"
4. There are no warnings about invalid window_size values

## Semantic Understanding

Based on the class name "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" and description "forward-looking windows":
- "Forward" implies looking ahead from the current position
- A negative window size would semantically mean looking backward, which contradicts "forward-looking"
- The mathematical impossibility of having start > end for valid array slicing is a fundamental invariant

## Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly forbid negative window_size values, the semantic meaning of "forward-looking windows" combined with the mathematical requirement that window bounds must have start <= end strongly suggests that negative window_size values should not be allowed. The current implementation fails to validate this constraint, leading to invalid window bounds.
