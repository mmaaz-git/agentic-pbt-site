## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering: INVALID
**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is reproducible and demonstrates actual incorrect behavior
- pandas.cut silently returns all NaN instead of binning valid float inputs
- The function accepts the inputs without type errors but fails to process them correctly

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The inputs are valid floating-point numbers
- The function should either work or raise a clear error
- Silent failure with NaN is undocumented behavior

### Considering: WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Subnormal floats (< ~1e-308) are extremely rare in practice
- Most applications never encounter values this small
- Could be considered an obscure edge case

**Arguments Against:**
- Scientific computing applications legitimately use such values
- Silent data loss is a serious issue regardless of rarity
- The fix is straightforward (detect and error or handle properly)
- Other numerical libraries handle subnormal floats correctly

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Silent failure causing data loss is never acceptable
- The issue affects valid use cases in scientific computing

### Considering: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that supporting subnormal floats is a new feature
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise support for all float ranges

**Arguments Against:**
- The function already accepts float inputs
- This is about fixing existing functionality, not adding new features
- Users reasonably expect all valid floats to work

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- pandas.cut already processes floating-point data
- This is fixing a defect in existing functionality

### Considering: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could document the limitation and call it resolved
- Add warning about numerical precision limits

**Arguments Against:**
- The code behavior itself is problematic (silent NaN conversion)
- Documentation alone doesn't fix the confusing error messages
- Users expect the function to work or fail clearly

**Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior needs fixing, not just documentation
- Silent failure is a code bug, not a documentation issue

### Considering: BUG
**Arguments For:**
- Function silently fails with valid input data
- Returns all NaN without warning or error
- Confusing error messages in some cases
- Undocumented limitation that causes data loss
- Other numerical libraries handle these cases better
- The fix is technically feasible

**Why it IS a BUG:**
- Silent data loss is unacceptable behavior
- Valid floating-point inputs produce incorrect results
- No clear error or warning to users
- Behavior contradicts reasonable expectations
- Can affect real scientific computing applications

### Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The key factors are:

1. **Silent failure**: The function returns all NaN values without any warning, which is the worst possible behavior for a data processing function

2. **Valid inputs**: The inputs are legitimate floating-point numbers that Python and NumPy handle correctly

3. **Data loss**: Users lose their data with no indication of what went wrong

4. **Fixable**: The issue can be addressed by either:
   - Detecting small ranges and raising an informative error
   - Implementing proper numerical handling for small values
   - At minimum, warning users about the limitation

5. **Real impact**: While rare, scientific computing applications dealing with quantum mechanics, particle physics, or other domains with extremely small measurements could encounter this issue

The silent conversion to NaN is particularly problematic because it can propagate through analysis pipelines undetected, leading to incorrect conclusions or wasted computation time.
