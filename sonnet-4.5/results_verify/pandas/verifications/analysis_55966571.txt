TRIAGE ANALYSIS

Evaluating the bug report against each possible classification:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report):
REASONS FOR:
- The behavior is undocumented - documentation never mentions sorting
- Inconsistent with ordered categoricals which preserve order
- Inconsistent with ALL other category manipulation methods (add_categories, remove_unused_categories, set_categories)
- Breaks reasonable user expectations about category order preservation
- Violates the principle of least surprise
- The invariant that add_categories followed by remove_categories should preserve order is broken
- Category order can be semantically meaningful even for unordered categoricals (e.g., display order)
- The implementation clearly shows this is an oversight: ordered categoricals explicitly use sort=False while unordered ones don't

REASONS AGAINST:
- Could argue that "unordered" means order doesn't matter
- No explicit promise in documentation about preserving order

2. INVALID:
REASONS FOR:
- The categories are "unordered" so one could argue order shouldn't matter
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise to preserve order

REASONS AGAINST:
- Other methods preserve order for unordered categoricals
- The inconsistency between ordered/unordered behavior is not documented
- Users have legitimate use cases for preserving category order even in unordered categoricals
- The behavior is surprising and inconsistent

3. WONTFIX:
REASONS FOR:
- Could be considered a minor issue since workaround exists (use ordered=True)
- Might have backwards compatibility concerns

REASONS AGAINST:
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects basic usage
- The fix is trivial (add sort=False for unordered case)
- Inconsistent behavior is a real usability issue

4. FEATURE_REQUEST:
REASONS FOR:
- Could frame preserving order as a new feature request

REASONS AGAINST:
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
- Other methods already preserve order - this is about consistency
- The ordered categorical version already does this

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
REASONS FOR:
- Could document that remove_categories sorts unordered categoricals

REASONS AGAINST:
- The behavior itself is problematic and inconsistent
- Documenting bad behavior doesn't make it right
- The code behavior should be fixed, not just documented

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is clearly a BUG. The implementation contains an obvious inconsistency where ordered categoricals explicitly preserve order (sort=False) but unordered ones don't. This is:
1. Undocumented behavior
2. Inconsistent with all other category methods
3. Inconsistent between ordered/unordered variants
4. Surprising to users
5. Easy to fix (just add sort=False for both cases)

The fact that the code explicitly handles ordered categoricals differently shows this was likely an oversight rather than intentional design.
