## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for FixedForwardWindowIndexer with negative window_size values.

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The Hypothesis test failed as expected with the following error:
- Input: num_values=2, window_size=-1, step=1
- Result: AssertionError: Invalid window: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0 with window_size=-1
- The test correctly identifies that start[1] > end[1], violating the invariant that window bounds should have start <= end

### Manual Test Reproduction
The manual reproduction code produced the exact output claimed in the bug report:
- start array: [0 1]
- end array: [0 0]
- Confirms that start[1]=1 > end[1]=0
- The rolling window operation with this indexer returns all NaN values, demonstrating the silent failure mode

### Bug Impact
1. The indexer produces invalid window bounds where start > end
2. This causes rolling operations to fail silently, returning NaN values rather than raising an error
3. Users get incorrect results without any indication that something went wrong

### Source Code Analysis
Looking at the implementation in FixedForwardWindowIndexer.get_window_bounds():
```python
start = np.arange(0, num_values, step, dtype="int64")
end = start + self.window_size
if self.window_size:
    end = np.clip(end, 0, num_values)
```

When window_size is negative:
- start is created normally as [0, 1, 2, ...]
- end = start + window_size produces values less than start (e.g., [0, 1] + (-1) = [-1, 0])
- The clipping operation clips negative values to 0, resulting in end=[0, 0]
- This creates the invalid condition where start[1]=1 > end[1]=0

The bug is confirmed and reproducible.
