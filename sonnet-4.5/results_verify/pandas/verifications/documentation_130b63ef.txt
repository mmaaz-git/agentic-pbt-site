Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.computation.parsing.clean_column_name
============================================================================

Documentation Sources Reviewed:
1. Function docstring (in source code)
2. Python help() output
3. Usage context in pandas.core.generic
4. Python tokenize module documentation

Key Documentation Findings:

1. Function Purpose (from docstring):
   - "Function to emulate the cleaning of a backtick quoted name"
   - Used to clean column names for use in DataFrame.eval() expressions
   - Converts names to valid Python identifiers when possible

2. Documented Error Handling Behavior:
   The docstring explicitly states:
   "For some cases, a name cannot be converted to a valid Python identifier.
    In that case :func:`tokenize_string` raises a SyntaxError.
    In that case, we just return the name unmodified."

3. Current Implementation:
   - Only catches SyntaxError
   - Does not catch TokenError
   - TokenError is a different exception class from SyntaxError

4. Usage Context:
   - Used in DataFrame._get_index_resolvers()
   - Used in DataFrame._get_cleaned_column_resolvers()
   - These methods prepare column names for use in eval() expressions
   - Column names with special characters are "cleaned up" for backtick quoting

5. Python's tokenize Module Documentation:
   - TokenError is raised for incomplete multi-line constructs
   - Also raised for "source code cannot contain null bytes"
   - TokenError is NOT a subclass of SyntaxError
   - They are distinct exception types

Documentation Assessment:

The documentation explicitly promises that when tokenize_string raises a SyntaxError,
the function will return the name unmodified. However:

1. The documentation doesn't mention TokenError at all
2. TokenError is a legitimate error that tokenize.generate_tokens can raise
3. Null bytes in source code cause TokenError, not SyntaxError
4. The implementation doesn't handle TokenError, contradicting the documented intent

The documented intent is clear: when tokenization fails, return the name unmodified.
The implementation fails to honor this intent for TokenError cases.

This appears to be an incomplete implementation rather than incorrect documentation,
since the documentation describes the desired behavior (graceful handling of
tokenization failures) but the code doesn't implement it fully.
