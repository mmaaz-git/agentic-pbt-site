DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function Documentation:
-----------------------
The `length_of_indexer()` function has the following documentation in the source code:

```python
def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
    """
    Return the expected length of target[indexer]

    Returns
    -------
    int
    """
```

This documentation is clear and concise: the function should return the length that would result from the operation `target[indexer]`.

Key Observations:
-----------------

1. **Purpose**: This is an internal utility function in pandas.core.indexers.utils used to calculate the expected length of an indexing operation before it's performed.

2. **No external documentation**: The function is not in the public pandas API documentation. It's an internal utility function.

3. **Usage context**: The function is primarily used by `check_setitem_lengths()` to validate that assignment operations have matching lengths between the indexer and the values being assigned.

4. **Implicit contract**: While not explicitly documented, the function name and docstring clearly establish that:
   - `length_of_indexer(indexer, target)` should equal `len(target[indexer])`
   - This should hold for all valid indexer types (slices, arrays, lists, etc.)

5. **Test coverage**: The existing test suite only tests the function with boolean arrays, not with slices where start >= len(target), which is why this bug wasn't caught.

Evaluation Against Bug Report:
-------------------------------

The bug report's assumption that `length_of_indexer(slc, target)` should equal `len(target[slc])` is CORRECT and aligned with:
- The function's documented purpose
- The function name itself
- How it's used in practice by check_setitem_lengths

The current implementation violating this invariant by returning negative values is clearly incorrect behavior, not undefined behavior. The documentation, while minimal, is sufficient to establish that negative lengths are wrong - lengths are by definition non-negative integers.
