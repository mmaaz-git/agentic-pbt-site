TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating this bug report against the five possible categories:

1. INVALID - Why it might be INVALID:
   - The docstring examples clearly show that classmethods should pass cls (the class)
   - Users are passing incorrect arguments (instance instead of class)
   - Could be considered user error

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The code accepts the invalid input without validation
   - The error occurs later, not at the point of misuse
   - The parameter name "class_instance" is ambiguous
   - No explicit documentation stating this requirement

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - Edge case that only occurs with incorrect usage
   - Easy workaround: just pass the correct type
   - Not a common scenario in practice

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - The crash is ungraceful and confusing
   - The error message doesn't help users understand what went wrong
   - This is not an obscure edge case - it's a reasonable mistake

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Adding support for instances with classmethods would be new functionality
   - Current behavior works as documented in examples

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
   - The code already accepts instances, it just fails later

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation could be clearer about requirements
   - The parameter name "class_instance" is misleading

   Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code has an actual bug - it crashes with valid Python objects
   - Documentation examples are correct, the code implementation is wrong

5. BUG - Why this IS a BUG:
   - The code accepts invalid input without validation
   - It crashes with an unhelpful AttributeError
   - The __init__ method has no input validation for this constraint
   - The error happens at str() conversion, not at object creation
   - This violates the principle of fail-fast
   - The fix is straightforward and improves robustness

DECISION: BUG

REASONING:
This is a legitimate bug because:
1. The code accepts input that it cannot handle, leading to a crash
2. The crash occurs at a different point than where the mistake was made
3. The error message is unhelpful and doesn't guide users to the solution
4. Either the __init__ should validate inputs, or __str__ should handle both cases
5. The proposed fix (Option 1) makes the code more robust without breaking existing usage
