DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Official Documentation Review:
------------------------------

1. Pandas Documentation (from pandas.pydata.org):
   - States that AbstractMethodError is raised "instead of NotImplementedError for abstract methods"
   - The `class_instance` parameter is described as "The class or instance where the abstract method is not implemented"
   - This explicitly indicates that BOTH classes and instances are valid inputs

2. Docstring Examples in Source Code (pandas/errors/__init__.py):
   The examples show the intended usage pattern:
   ```python
   class Foo:
       @classmethod
       def classmethod(cls):
           raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(cls, methodtype="classmethod")
       def method(self):
           raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(self)
   ```
   - For classmethods: Pass `cls` (the class itself)
   - For instance methods: Pass `self` (the instance)

3. Test Suite (pandas/tests/test_errors.py):
   Confirms the pattern - classmethods use `cls`, not `self`:
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def classmethod(cls):
       raise AbstractMethodError(cls, methodtype="classmethod")
   ```

Documentation Inconsistency Analysis:
--------------------------------------

The bug report's claim of "documented usage pattern" is INCORRECT. The documentation and examples consistently show that:
- When methodtype='classmethod', you should pass the CLASS (`cls`), not an instance
- The parameter name `class_instance` is somewhat misleading as it suggests both are valid for all methodtypes

However, there is a potential documentation issue:
- The parameter name `class_instance` and its description "The class or instance" could be clearer
- It should specify that for methodtype='classmethod', only a class is valid
- The current naming/description creates ambiguity about what's acceptable

Conclusion:
-----------
The code behaves exactly as the examples demonstrate. The bug report's usage (passing an instance with methodtype='classmethod') contradicts the documented examples. However, the parameter documentation could be clearer about this requirement.
