DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

I have reviewed the documentation for pandas.util.hash_array from multiple sources:

1. OFFICIAL PANDAS DOCUMENTATION (pandas.pydata.org):
The official documentation states:
- Parameter: "hash_key: str, default '0123456789123456' - Hash_key for string key to encode."
- The description says "Hash_key for string key to encode" which could be interpreted as applying only to strings
- However, the parameter is listed as applying to the entire function, not just certain input types
- There is NO mention that hash_key only applies to object arrays
- There is NO mention that hash_key is ignored for numeric types

2. DOCSTRING IN SOURCE CODE (from pandas/core/util/hashing.py):
```
hash_key : str, default _default_hash_key
    Hash_key for string key to encode.
```
- The docstring says "for string key to encode"
- This is ambiguous - it could mean:
  a) The hash_key itself is a string that gets encoded
  b) The hash_key is used when encoding string data
- The docstring does NOT explicitly state that hash_key is only used for object arrays
- The docstring does NOT warn that hash_key is ignored for numeric arrays

3. FUNCTION SIGNATURE:
```python
pandas.util.hash_array(vals, encoding='utf8', hash_key='0123456789123456', categorize=True)
```
- The function accepts hash_key as a parameter for ALL input types
- No type-specific parameter documentation exists

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR FROM API PERSPECTIVE:
- When a function accepts a parameter, users reasonably expect it to have an effect
- The function silently accepts hash_key for numeric arrays without warning it's ignored
- Other pandas functions typically warn or error when parameters are incompatible with inputs

5. COMPARISON WITH SIMILAR FUNCTIONS:
- The related hash_pandas_object function uses hash_key consistently across types
- Users migrating between these functions would expect similar behavior

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is insufficient and misleading:
1. It does not clearly state that hash_key only applies to object arrays
2. The phrase "for string key to encode" is ambiguous and confusing
3. Users have no way to know from the documentation when hash_key will or won't be used
4. The API accepts the parameter without warning when it's ignored

This is either:
- A bug in the implementation (hash_key should work for all types)
- A documentation bug (documentation should clearly state the limitation)
- Both (the behavior is inconsistent AND poorly documented)
