## Documentation Analysis

### Official Pandas Documentation

1. **NumpyExtensionArray Documentation**:
   - Described as: "A pandas ExtensionArray for NumPy data"
   - Purpose: "mostly for internal compatibility, and is not especially useful on its own"
   - No explicit documentation about dtype equality behavior
   - No warning that the dtype property returns a different type than numpy dtypes

2. **NumpyEADtype Documentation**:
   - Described as: "A Pandas ExtensionDtype for NumPy dtypes"
   - Purpose: "mostly for internal compatibility, and is not especially useful on its own"
   - Has a `.numpy_dtype` property documented as "The NumPy dtype this NumpyEADtype wraps"

3. **ExtensionDtype Base Class**:
   - Documentation states that `__eq__` checks equality by:
     * Matching string names (via `construct_from_string`)
     * Being instances of the same type with equal metadata attributes
   - No mention of compatibility with numpy dtypes

4. **ExtensionArray Documentation**:
   - States that the dtype attribute should be "an instance of ExtensionDtype"
   - Does not specify whether it should be equal to wrapped numpy dtypes

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. Neither `NumpyExtensionArray` nor `NumpyEADtype` documentation explicitly states whether dtype equality with numpy dtypes is expected or not expected.

2. The documentation says these are "mostly for internal compatibility" but doesn't clarify what this means for users who might use them.

3. The existence of `.numpy_dtype` attribute suggests awareness that users might need the actual numpy dtype, but the relationship between `dtype` and `numpy_dtype` is not documented.

4. No explicit contract is documented about dtype equality semantics for arrays that wrap numpy data.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly promise that `NumpyExtensionArray.dtype` should equal the underlying numpy dtype. However, it also doesn't warn users that this equality won't hold, which is a reasonable expectation given:
- The class name includes "Numpy"
- It's documented as wrapping numpy data
- String representations are identical
- A separate `.numpy_dtype` attribute exists that does equal the numpy dtype
