## Documentation Review for pandas.cut and pandas.qcut

### pandas.cut Documentation
According to the official pandas documentation, pd.cut() is designed to "bin values into discrete intervals" and convert continuous variables into categorical variables. The documentation states:
- It accepts 1-dimensional arrays as input
- It returns an array-like object representing bin assignments
- It preserves NA values in the output
- Default precision for bin labels is 3 decimal places
- Out-of-bounds values are assigned NA

The documentation does NOT specify:
- Any limitations on the range of floating-point values that can be processed
- How extremely small floating-point numbers (e.g., denormalized numbers near machine epsilon) should be handled
- Any expected behavior when internal rounding operations fail
- Maximum or minimum values that can be reliably processed

### pandas.qcut Documentation
Similarly, pd.qcut() is documented as a "quantile-based discretization function" that divides data into equal-sized buckets. The documentation states:
- It divides data based on rank or sample quantiles
- It handles out-of-bounds values as NA
- It supports a 'duplicates' parameter to handle non-unique bin edges

The documentation does NOT specify:
- Handling of extreme floating-point values
- Behavior when internal precision calculations fail
- Limitations on the magnitude of input values

### numpy.around Documentation
The numpy.around() function, which is used internally by _round_frac, has minimal documentation about limitations:
- No mention of maximum decimal places supported
- No documented behavior for when extremely large decimal values are passed
- No warning about potential NaN results with extreme inputs

### Key Finding
Neither pandas nor numpy documentation explicitly states that these functions should handle ALL valid floating-point numbers, including extremely small denormalized numbers like 2.2e-313. The documentation also doesn't warn about potential failures with such inputs. The functions are documented to work with general numeric data but without specific guarantees about extreme edge cases in the floating-point representation.
