## Documentation Analysis for pandas.compat._optional.get_version

### Key Findings:

1. **This is a PRIVATE internal function**: The pandas.compat module is part of pandas' private API. It is not documented in the official pandas API reference, and is not intended for direct use by pandas users.

2. **No official documentation exists**: Since this is an internal function, there is no official documentation specifying its expected behavior, error handling requirements, or edge cases.

3. **Function purpose from source code**:
   - The function extracts version information from Python modules
   - It has special handling for psycopg2 which appends extra information like " (dt dec pq3 ext lo64)" to its version string
   - The comment in line 80 states: "psycopg2 appends ' (dt dec pq3 ext lo64)' to it's version"

4. **Current implementation**:
   ```python
   def get_version(module: types.ModuleType) -> str:
       version = getattr(module, "__version__", None)

       if version is None:
           raise ImportError(f"Can't determine version for {module.__name__}")
       if module.__name__ == "psycopg2":
           # psycopg2 appends " (dt dec pq3 ext lo64)" to it's version
           version = version.split()[0]
       return version
   ```

5. **No specification for edge cases**: The documentation and comments do not specify:
   - What should happen if psycopg2's version string contains only whitespace
   - What should happen if psycopg2's version string is empty
   - Whether the function should handle malformed version strings gracefully

6. **Internal usage context**: This function is primarily used within `import_optional_dependency` to check if installed packages meet minimum version requirements. It's not exposed as part of the public API.

### Conclusion:
Since this is an internal, undocumented function, there is no formal specification that defines how it should handle edge cases like whitespace-only version strings for psycopg2. The current behavior (raising IndexError) is not explicitly documented as correct or incorrect.
