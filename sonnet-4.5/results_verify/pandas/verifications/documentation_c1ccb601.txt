## Documentation Analysis for pandas.read_clipboard and pandas.read_csv

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **read_clipboard documentation** (lines 36-38 of clipboards.py):
   - States: "sep : str, default '\\s+' - A string or regex delimiter"
   - Explicitly mentions that the separator can be "A string or regex delimiter"
   - Does NOT specify when a separator is treated as literal vs regex

2. **read_csv documentation** (from pandas official docs and help):
   - States: "separators longer than 1 character and different from '\\s+' will be interpreted as regular expressions"
   - This is a CRITICAL piece of information that clarifies the behavior
   - Explicitly states that multi-character separators ARE treated as regex patterns
   - Provides an example of regex use: '\r\t'
   - Notes that "regex delimiters are prone to ignoring quoted data"

3. **Implementation details** (lines 119-127 of clipboards.py):
   - The code comments state: "Regex separator currently only works with python engine"
   - When len(sep) > 1, the code automatically switches to the python engine
   - The comment itself acknowledges that multi-character separators are treated as regex

### What the documentation DOES say:
- Multi-character separators (longer than 1 char) ARE interpreted as regular expressions
- This forces the use of the Python parsing engine
- The behavior is documented in read_csv but NOT clearly in read_clipboard

### What the documentation DOES NOT say:
- read_clipboard's docstring does not mention that multi-char separators are treated as regex
- Neither documentation explains how to use literal multi-character separators that contain regex metacharacters
- No mention of needing to escape regex metacharacters for literal use
- No guidance on using re.escape() for literal separators

### Documentation gap:
The read_clipboard docstring is incomplete - it doesn't inherit or reference the critical behavior from read_csv that multi-character separators are treated as regex patterns. Users reading only the read_clipboard documentation would not know this important detail.
