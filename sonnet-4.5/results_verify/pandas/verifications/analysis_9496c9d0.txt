BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Evaluation for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence FOR:**
- The implementation violates RFC 7235 specification which explicitly allows "1*SP" (one or more spaces)
- Real-world authentication failures occur when extra spaces are present in Authorization headers
- The bug has practical security implications - valid tokens are rejected due to whitespace
- The fix is straightforward and would improve RFC compliance
- Multiple scenarios can trigger this bug (proxy normalization, manual testing, client errors)
- The behavior is inconsistent with HTTP specification standards

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- None significant

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Evidence FOR:**
- None

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The RFC specification clearly supports the bug report's claims
- The test cases accurately demonstrate the issue

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Evidence FOR:**
- Could argue that clients should properly format headers with single spaces

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- This is not a trivial issue - it causes authentication failures
- RFC 7235 explicitly allows multiple spaces, so this is a specification violation
- Real-world impact on production systems is significant
- Many HTTP clients and proxies may introduce extra spaces

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Evidence FOR:**
- FastAPI doesn't explicitly document this limitation

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- The code behavior violates the HTTP specification (RFC 7235)
- This is not a documentation issue but a code compliance issue
- The RFC is the authoritative documentation for HTTP headers

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Feature)
**Evidence FOR:**
- None

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- RFC 7235 compliance is expected behavior, not a new feature
- The function already attempts to parse Authorization headers, just incorrectly

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG** that should be fixed:

1. **Specification Violation**: The implementation violates RFC 7235 which explicitly allows multiple spaces ("1*SP") between scheme and credentials

2. **Real Security Impact**: Authentication fails for valid tokens when extra spaces are present, causing production issues

3. **Not Edge Case**: Multiple realistic scenarios can introduce extra spaces:
   - Client implementation variations
   - Proxy/middleware whitespace normalization
   - Manual testing with formatting tools
   - Copy-paste errors in development

4. **Clear Fix Available**: The suggested fix (param.lstrip()) is simple and correct

5. **Standards Compliance**: HTTP libraries should follow RFC specifications for interoperability

This is not a documentation issue or feature request, but a legitimate bug where the implementation fails to meet the HTTP specification requirements. The bug has real-world impact on authentication systems.
