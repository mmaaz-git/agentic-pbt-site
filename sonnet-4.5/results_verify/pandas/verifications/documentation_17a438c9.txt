DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR _validate_names

1. FUNCTION DOCSTRING (pandas/io/parsers/readers.py, lines 560-572):
   The docstring clearly states:
   - "Raise ValueError if the `names` parameter contains duplicates or has an invalid data type."
   - Under the Raises section: "ValueError: If names are not unique or are not ordered (e.g. set)."

   The documentation explicitly requires that names must be UNIQUE, with no exceptions mentioned for NaN values.

2. PANDAS READ_CSV DOCUMENTATION:
   The official pandas.read_csv documentation states for the 'names' parameter:
   - "Duplicates in this list are not allowed."

   This is an absolute statement with no exceptions or special cases mentioned for NaN values.

3. IMPLEMENTATION (line 575):
   The current implementation uses: if len(names) != len(set(names))
   This approach relies on Python's set behavior for duplicate detection.

4. PYTHON NAN BEHAVIOR:
   - NaN (Not a Number) has the IEEE 754 standard property that NaN != NaN
   - This means each NaN is considered unique when placed in a set
   - set([nan, nan]) creates a set with 2 elements, not 1

5. SEMANTIC EXPECTATION:
   The term "duplicates" in the documentation implies values that are conceptually the same.
   Two NaN values, while not equal by IEEE 754 standard, represent the same conceptual entity
   (a missing or undefined numeric value).

CONCLUSION FROM DOCUMENTATION:
The documentation clearly states that duplicate names are not allowed, with no exceptions.
The current implementation fails to enforce this for NaN values due to a technical quirk
of NaN inequality, rather than by design. The documentation does not suggest that multiple
NaN column names should be permitted as a special case.
