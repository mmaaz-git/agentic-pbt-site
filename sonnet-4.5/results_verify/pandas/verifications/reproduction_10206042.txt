# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The issue occurs exactly as stated.

## Reproduction Results

### Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis test provided in the bug report was executed successfully and confirms the issue:
- The test fails because `ZeroDivisionError` is raised instead of `ValueError`
- The failing input example provided (`num_values=1, window_size=0, step=0`) correctly triggers the issue
- The test correctly identifies that the current behavior raises `ZeroDivisionError` when it should raise a more informative `ValueError`

### Manual Reproduction
The manual example code provided in the bug report also reproduces the issue:
```python
from pandas.api.indexers import FixedForwardWindowIndexer
indexer = FixedForwardWindowIndexer(window_size=5)
start, end = indexer.get_window_bounds(num_values=10, step=0)
```

Results:
- Exception type: `ZeroDivisionError`
- Exception message: "division by zero"
- Traceback confirms the error occurs at line 340 in `pandas/core/indexers/objects.py`
- The error occurs in the call to `np.arange(0, num_values, step, dtype="int64")`

## Verification of Bug Report Claims

1. **Crash with ZeroDivisionError**: ✓ Confirmed - The function does crash with `ZeroDivisionError` when `step=0`
2. **Error location**: ✓ Confirmed - The error occurs at the exact line indicated in the bug report (line 340)
3. **No input validation**: ✓ Confirmed - There is no validation for `step <= 0` before the call to `np.arange`
4. **Unhelpful error message**: ✓ Confirmed - The error message "division by zero" doesn't explain that the `step` parameter must be positive

## Conclusion
The bug report is accurate in all its claims. The function crashes with an unhelpful `ZeroDivisionError` when `step=0` is passed, instead of providing a clear `ValueError` with an informative message about the requirement for a positive step value.
