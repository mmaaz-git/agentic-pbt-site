REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - Ran the provided Hypothesis test with constant series
   - The test FAILS as expected with AssertionError: "All autocorrelation values are NaN"
   - A RuntimeWarning is raised: "invalid value encountered in scalar divide"
   - This confirms that for ANY constant series (regardless of value or length), the function produces NaN values

2. MANUAL EXAMPLE REPRODUCTION:
   - Tested with series = pd.Series([42.0] * 20)
   - Output confirmed: Autocorrelation values: [nan nan nan nan nan ...]
   - All NaN: True
   - Same RuntimeWarning about division by zero

3. ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION:
   - Examined the source code in pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/misc.py
   - The function calculates c0 = np.sum((data - mean) ** 2) / n
   - For a constant series, c0 = 0 (zero variance)
   - The autocorrelation calculation r(h) divides by c0, causing division by zero
   - This produces NaN values for all lags

4. ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
   - The function silently produces a plot with all NaN values
   - A RuntimeWarning is issued but not an error
   - The resulting plot is meaningless and provides no useful information
   - Users may not realize the plot contains invalid data

The bug report accurately describes the issue and its root cause.
