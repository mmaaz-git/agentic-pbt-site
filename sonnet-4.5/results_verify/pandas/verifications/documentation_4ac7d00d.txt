## Documentation Analysis for SparseArray.density

The density property is documented in the source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/arrays/sparse/array.py` lines 697-708.

### Official Documentation:
```python
@property
def density(self) -> float:
    """
    The percent of non- ``fill_value`` points, as decimal.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pandas.arrays import SparseArray
    >>> s = SparseArray([0, 0, 1, 1, 1], fill_value=0)
    >>> s.density
    0.6
    """
    return self.sp_index.npoints / self.sp_index.length
```

### Key Points from Documentation:
1. The density property returns a float representing "The percent of non-fill_value points, as decimal"
2. The example shows a SparseArray with 5 elements where 3 are non-zero (non-fill_value), resulting in density of 0.6 (3/5)
3. The documentation does not specify what should happen for empty arrays
4. The documentation does not mention any edge cases or special handling
5. The implementation shows a simple division: `self.sp_index.npoints / self.sp_index.length`

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say:
- No mention of how empty arrays should be handled
- No specification about whether ZeroDivisionError is expected or not
- No indication that the property should fail for any valid SparseArray state
- No warning about potential division by zero

### Related Documentation:
From pandas documentation, density is consistently described across Series and DataFrame sparse accessors as "The ratio of non-sparse points to total (dense) data points" or "The percent of non-fill_value points, as decimal."

The fact that the documentation example only shows a non-empty array case and doesn't warn about empty arrays suggests the property should work for all valid SparseArray instances, including empty ones.
