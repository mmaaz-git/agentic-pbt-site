## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The code could be working as intended, and the term "union" in list context means concatenation
- The method name and implementation are consistent

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- There is a clear docstring error - the Returns section contradicts the method's summary
- The Returns section says "collection difference" which is objectively wrong
- The code behavior matches the method name and first line of docstring, not the Returns section

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- FrozenList appears to be an internal API not meant for public use
- The error is only in documentation, not functionality
- It's a trivial documentation issue that doesn't affect functionality

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Even internal APIs should have correct documentation
- The docstring error is misleading and could confuse developers working on pandas internals
- It's a simple fix that improves code clarity

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- N/A - This is not requesting new functionality

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The bug report is about fixing incorrect documentation, not adding new features
- The functionality already exists and works correctly

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code performs the correct operation (concatenation/union)
- Only the docstring Returns section is incorrect
- The fix requires only changing documentation, not code
- This is a classic copy-paste error from the difference method

**Why it SHOULD be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Clear documentation error where Returns section contradicts the method summary
- The implementation is correct and matches the method name
- Line 46 incorrectly says "collection difference" when it should describe concatenation
- This appears to be a copy-paste error from the difference method's docstring

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it might be BUG:**
- There's an inconsistency between documentation and expected behavior

**Why it's NOT BUG:**
- The code works correctly - it concatenates as the method name suggests
- The issue is purely in documentation, not implementation
- The method summary (line 36) correctly describes the behavior

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. The method implementation is correct and performs concatenation as expected
2. The method name "union" is appropriate for list concatenation
3. The method summary (line 36) correctly states "Returns a FrozenList with other concatenated to the end of self"
4. The Returns section (line 46) incorrectly states "The collection difference between self and other"
5. This is an obvious copy-paste error from the difference method (line 64 has the same text)
6. The fix is simple: update line 46 to correctly describe the concatenation operation

The bug report correctly identifies this documentation error and proposes an appropriate fix.
