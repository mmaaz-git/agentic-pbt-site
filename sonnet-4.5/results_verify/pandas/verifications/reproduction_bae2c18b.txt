## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The hypothesis test fails exactly as described when `methodtype='classmethod'` is used with an instance object. The test crashes with:
```
AttributeError: 'DummyClass' object has no attribute '__name__'
```

### Minimal Reproduction
The minimal example provided also crashes with the same error when attempting to convert the AbstractMethodError to a string.

### Root Cause
The bug occurs in the `__str__` method of `AbstractMethodError` (lines 303-308):

```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    if self.methodtype == "classmethod":
        name = self.class_instance.__name__  # Line 305 - assumes class_instance is a class
    else:
        name = type(self.class_instance).__name__  # Gets class name from instance
```

When `methodtype == "classmethod"`, the code assumes `class_instance` is a class object (which has `__name__` attribute). However, the `__init__` method accepts any object as `class_instance`, including instances.

### Valid vs Invalid Usage
Testing the documented examples shows:
1. When used correctly with `cls` in a classmethod: Works fine
2. When used with `self` in a regular method: Works fine
3. When used with an instance and `methodtype='classmethod'`: Crashes with AttributeError

The bug is real and reproducible - there's an inconsistency between what the `__init__` accepts and what the `__str__` method expects when `methodtype='classmethod'`.
