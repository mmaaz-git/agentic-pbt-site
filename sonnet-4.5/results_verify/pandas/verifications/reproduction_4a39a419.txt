## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in `pandas.io.json._normalize.nested_to_record`.

### Test Results:

1. **Simple nested dict with integer keys `{1: {2: 'value'}}`**: FAILS with `KeyError: '1'`
2. **Mixed dict `{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: {4: 'c', 5: 'd'}}`**: FAILS with `KeyError: '3'`
3. **Dict with string keys `{'a': {'b': 'value'}}`**: SUCCEEDS (returns `{'a.b': 'value'}`)
4. **Flat dict with integer keys `{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}`**: SUCCEEDS (returns `{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}`)
5. **Property-based test**: Multiple failures with integer keys when values are nested dicts

### Root Cause Analysis:

The bug is exactly as described in the report. Looking at the code:

1. At line 96-99, when iterating through dictionary items, if a key `k` is not a string, it gets converted to a string: `k = str(k)`
2. Later at lines 113 and 117, the code tries to pop the value using `new_d.pop(k)`
3. However, `k` is now the stringified version (e.g., `"1"`), but `new_d` still contains the original integer key (e.g., `1`)
4. This causes a `KeyError` because `new_d` doesn't have the stringified key

### Observed Pattern:

- The bug ONLY occurs when:
  1. The dictionary has non-string keys (e.g., integers)
  2. AND the value associated with that key is a nested dictionary
- The bug does NOT occur when:
  1. All keys are strings
  2. OR when non-string keys have non-dict values (flat structure)

### Technical Validity:

The reported bug is technically correct. The code has a logic error where it:
1. Modifies the key variable `k` to be a string
2. But then uses this modified key to access the original dictionary which still has the non-string key
3. The proposed fix (preserving the original key for dictionary operations) would resolve this issue

### Documentation vs Implementation:

The documentation says the function accepts "dict or list of dicts" without any restriction on key types. The code even has explicit logic to handle non-string keys (lines 98-99), indicating this was intended functionality. Therefore, the crash represents a failure to implement the intended behavior correctly.
