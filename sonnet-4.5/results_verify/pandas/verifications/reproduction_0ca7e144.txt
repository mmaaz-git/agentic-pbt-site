## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the Hypothesis-based tests and manual reproduction code confirm the issue.

### Hypothesis Test Results
- Running the property-based tests with Hypothesis confirms that both `cat_core` and `cat_safe` fail when given an empty list
- The functions return an integer `0` instead of a numpy array, regardless of the separator string provided
- The test fails immediately on the first example (empty separator string '')

### Manual Reproduction Results
When calling `cat_core([], ',')` and `cat_safe([], ',')`:
- Both functions return the integer value `0`
- The type is confirmed as `int` rather than `np.ndarray`
- `isinstance(result, np.ndarray)` returns False for both functions

### Observed Behavior
1. `cat_core([], ',')` returns: `0` (type: int)
2. `cat_safe([], ',')` returns: `0` (type: int)

### Expected Behavior
Based on the bug report, both functions should return an empty numpy array when given an empty list input.

### Effect of the Bug
This bug would cause downstream code to fail if it:
1. Expects the return value to be a numpy array
2. Attempts to call array-specific methods on the returned value (would raise AttributeError)
3. Performs type checking on the return value
4. Uses the return value in array operations

The bug report's claim that the functions return `0` instead of a numpy array when given an empty list is confirmed and reproducible.
