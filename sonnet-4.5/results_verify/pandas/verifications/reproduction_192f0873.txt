## Bug Reproduction Results

### Reported Issue
The bug report claims that:
1. `Infinity > Infinity` returns True (expected False)
2. `NegativeInfinity < NegativeInfinity` returns True (expected False)

### Reproduction Confirmed
Running the test code confirms the reported behavior:

**Infinity self-comparisons:**
- `Infinity > Infinity`: **True** (bug report claims this is wrong)
- `Infinity < Infinity`: False
- `Infinity == Infinity`: True
- `Infinity >= Infinity`: True
- `Infinity <= Infinity`: **False** (mathematically should be True since Infinity == Infinity)

**NegativeInfinity self-comparisons:**
- `NegativeInfinity < NegativeInfinity`: **True** (bug report claims this is wrong)
- `NegativeInfinity > NegativeInfinity`: False
- `NegativeInfinity == NegativeInfinity`: True
- `NegativeInfinity <= NegativeInfinity`: True
- `NegativeInfinity >= NegativeInfinity`: **False** (mathematically should be True since NegativeInfinity == NegativeInfinity)

### Mathematical Correctness
The bug report is technically correct about mathematical properties:
- In mathematics, for any value x, `x > x` must be false (irreflexive property of strict ordering)
- Similarly, `x < x` must be false
- The relation `x <= x` and `x >= x` should both be true when `x == x` is true

### Practical Impact Testing
However, when testing actual usage:

1. **Sorting still works correctly**: Lists containing Infinity values sort properly, with NegativeInfinity at the beginning and Infinity at the end.

2. **Version comparison works correctly**: When used as sentinel values in version comparison tuples, the comparison works as intended:
   - Two identical tuples containing Infinity values compare as equal
   - The tuple comparison `<` and `>` return False for identical tuples (correct behavior)

3. **The bug does NOT affect actual version sorting**: The Version class uses these sentinels in tuples, and Python's tuple comparison stops at the first differing element. Since versions with identical release numbers but different pre/post/dev segments will differ at those positions, the Infinity self-comparison issue never actually matters.

### Key Observation
The "bug" only manifests when comparing Infinity directly to itself, which doesn't happen in real usage. In the version comparison system, Infinity values are compared within tuples, and tuple comparison short-circuits before reaching the problematic self-comparison case.
