## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I successfully reproduced the bug where pandas.read_json() converts empty strings to NaT values when round-tripping through JSON serialization.

### Property-Based Test Reproduction
The property-based test from the bug report fails as described:
- Input: `data=['']` (a Series containing a single empty string)
- Expected behavior: Round-trip should preserve the empty string
- Actual behavior: Empty string becomes NaT (Not-a-Time) datetime value
- Error: "Series values are different (100.0%)" - left has empty string '', right has NaT

### Manual Reproduction
Running the manual reproduction code confirmed the issue:

**Original Series:**
- Value: '' (empty string)
- dtype: object

**JSON representation:**
`{"name":null,"index":[0],"data":[""]}`

**Recovered Series (with default convert_dates=True):**
- Value: NaT
- dtype: datetime64[ns]

### Workaround Verification
Confirmed that setting `convert_dates=False` preserves empty strings correctly:
- With convert_dates=False: Value remains '' with dtype object
- This workaround successfully prevents the unwanted conversion

### Conclusion
The bug is fully reproducible. The automatic date conversion in read_json() is incorrectly treating empty strings as parseable dates and converting them to NaT, breaking the expected round-trip property for JSON serialization/deserialization.
