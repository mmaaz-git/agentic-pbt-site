## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review:

1. **SparseArray.argmin/argmax docstrings** (from source code):
   - Both methods are documented to "Return the index of minimum/maximum value"
   - "In case of multiple occurrences of the minimum/maximum value, the index corresponding to the first occurrence is returned"
   - No special cases or exceptions are documented
   - No mention of behavior when all values equal the fill value

2. **ExtensionArray base class documentation**:
   - SparseArray inherits from ExtensionArray
   - The base class documentation has identical wording about returning "the index of minimum/maximum value"
   - No exceptions or special cases documented

3. **Expected behavior based on documentation**:
   - The documentation clearly states these methods should return an integer index
   - There is no documented exception for arrays where all values are the same
   - The documentation example shows: `pd.array([3, 1, 2, 5, 4]).argmin()` returns `1`
   - By extension, `pd.array([1, 1, 1]).argmin()` should return `0` (first occurrence)

4. **Numpy compatibility expectation**:
   - While not explicitly documented, pandas generally aims for numpy compatibility
   - The SparseArray has a `to_dense()` method that returns a numpy array
   - Users would reasonably expect `sparse.argmin() == sparse.to_dense().argmin()`
   - This expectation is violated by the current behavior

### Key Finding:

The documentation makes no mention of any special behavior or potential errors when:
- All values in the array are the same
- All values equal the fill value
- The sparse representation has no stored values

The documentation promises to "Return the index of minimum/maximum value" without qualification. Therefore, raising a `ValueError` for arrays like `[0]` or `[0, 0, 0]` is inconsistent with the documented behavior.

### Conclusion:

Based on the documentation, the current behavior is incorrect. The methods should return a valid index (specifically 0 for the first occurrence) even when all values are the same, rather than raising an exception. The bug report correctly identifies a discrepancy between documented and actual behavior.
