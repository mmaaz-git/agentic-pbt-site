## Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.computation.eval

### Official Documentation
The pandas.eval() function is documented to evaluate Python expressions as strings. Key points from the official documentation:

1. **expr parameter**: Described as "The expression to evaluate. This string cannot contain any Python statements, only Python expressions."

2. **ValueError exceptions**: The documentation explicitly states that ValueError is raised in several scenarios, including:
   - target=None with multiline expressions
   - Multiline expressions without proper item assignment
   - inplace=True without item assignment
   - Target doesn't support string item assignment

However, the documentation does NOT explicitly mention behavior for empty strings or whitespace-only strings.

### Source Code Analysis
Looking at the actual implementation in pandas/core/computation/eval.py:

1. **_check_expression function** (lines 108-123):
   - Docstring states: "Make sure an expression is not an empty string"
   - Raises ValueError "If expr is an empty string"
   - Implementation: `if not expr: raise ValueError("expr cannot be an empty string")`

2. **eval function flow**:
   - Line 306: Calls `_check_expression(expr)` for string inputs
   - Line 307: Then splits by lines and strips whitespace: `[e.strip() for e in expr.splitlines() if e.strip() != ""]`
   - Line 327: Each expression goes through `_convert_expression(expr)` which also calls `_check_expression`

### Key Finding
The documentation (both in docstrings and the implementation) indicates that empty strings should raise a ValueError. The _check_expression function's docstring explicitly says it raises ValueError "If expr is an empty string".

However, the implementation uses `if not expr` which is a truthiness check. In Python:
- `not ""` evaluates to True (empty string)
- `not "   "` evaluates to False (whitespace string is truthy)

This means whitespace-only strings bypass the empty check, even though they contain no actual expression content.

### Documentation Gap
The documentation doesn't explicitly specify whether whitespace-only strings should be treated as empty or not. The error message says "expr cannot be an empty string" but doesn't clarify if "empty" means:
1. Zero-length string only
2. Semantically empty (no meaningful content after stripping whitespace)

The fact that line 307 filters out empty lines after stripping (`if e.strip() != ""`) suggests the code expects to handle whitespace, but the initial check doesn't account for this.
