## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug reported in pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError has been successfully reproduced. The error occurs when passing an instance object with methodtype='classmethod', causing an AttributeError when the __str__ method tries to access the __name__ attribute.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Property-Based Test Reproduction**
   - Ran the hypothesis test with different methodtype values
   - Test FAILED on methodtype='classmethod' with an instance object
   - Error: AttributeError: 'DummyClass' object has no attribute '__name__'
   - Falsifying input confirmed: methodtype='classmethod'

2. **Simple Example Reproduction**
   - Created a simple class MyClass and instantiated it
   - Passed the instance to AbstractMethodError with methodtype='classmethod'
   - Result: AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__name__'
   - The crash occurs exactly as described in the bug report

3. **Source Code Verification**
   - Located the problematic code in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/errors/__init__.py
   - Lines 304-308 show the __str__ method implementation
   - Line 305: `name = self.class_instance.__name__` assumes class_instance is a class when methodtype='classmethod'
   - This assumption fails when an instance is passed instead of a class

4. **Normal Usage Test**
   - Tested the documented usage pattern where cls is passed for classmethods
   - This works correctly: passing cls (the class) to AbstractMethodError with methodtype='classmethod'
   - The error only occurs when passing an instance instead of a class

### Conclusion
The bug is confirmed. When methodtype='classmethod', the code assumes that class_instance will have a __name__ attribute (which classes have but instances don't). This causes an AttributeError when an instance is passed instead of a class.
