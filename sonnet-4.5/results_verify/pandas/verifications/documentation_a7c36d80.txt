## Documentation Analysis

### 1. Pandas Official Documentation
From the pandas documentation for `lag_plot`:
- **Parameter Description**: "lag : int, default 1 - Lag length of the scatter plot."
- **No explicit constraints**: The documentation does NOT specify valid ranges for the lag parameter
- **No mention of negative values**: Documentation neither explicitly allows nor prohibits negative lag values
- **Default value**: 1 (positive integer), implying positive values are expected
- **Axis labels**: Documentation shows "y(t)" on x-axis and "y(t + lag)" on y-axis

### 2. Function Docstring (from source)
The docstring in the actual code states:
- "lag : int, default 1 - Lag length of the scatter plot."
- Examples only show positive lag values (lag=1)
- No validation or constraints mentioned

### 3. Statistical Definition of Lag Plots
From statistical references (NIST handbook and other sources):
- A lag plot is defined as plotting Yi versus Yi-k where k is the lag
- Standard definition uses POSITIVE lags to examine autocorrelation
- Lag k means "k time periods apart" in the PAST
- Mathematical definition: Plot Yi (vertical) vs Yi-lag (horizontal)

### 4. Negative Lag Interpretation
While negative lags have meaning in cross-correlation analysis (indicating lead relationships between different series):
- Negative lags are NOT standard in autocorrelation lag plots
- A lag plot with negative lag would mean plotting Yi vs Yi+|lag| (future values vs current)
- This reverses the standard interpretation and is not meaningful for detecting autocorrelation

### 5. Documentation Gaps
The pandas documentation has these gaps:
1. Does not specify that lag must be positive
2. Does not explain what happens with invalid lag values
3. Does not provide error handling expectations
4. The axis label "y(t + lag)" becomes confusing with negative lag (e.g., "y(t + -1)")

### Conclusion
While the documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit negative lags, the mathematical definition of lag plots, the default value of 1, and the standard statistical interpretation all indicate that lag should be positive. The documentation could be clearer about this constraint, but the expected behavior based on the concept of lag plots is that negative values should not be allowed.
