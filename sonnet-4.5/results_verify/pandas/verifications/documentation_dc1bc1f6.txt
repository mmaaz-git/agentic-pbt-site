DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have reviewed all available documentation for the pandas.tseries.frequencies functions is_subperiod() and is_superperiod().

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------

1. Function Docstrings (from help() command):

   is_subperiod(source, target) -> bool
   - "Returns True if downsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"
   - Parameters: source (frequency converting from), target (frequency converting to)
   - Returns: bool

   is_superperiod(source, target) -> bool
   - "Returns True if upsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"
   - Parameters: source (frequency converting from), target (frequency converting to)
   - Returns: bool

2. External Documentation:
   - These functions are not prominently documented in the main pandas API documentation
   - They appear to be internal utility functions used by pandas' resampling functionality
   - No official pandas documentation page exists for these specific functions

KEY FINDINGS:
------------

1. Clear Functional Purpose:
   - The docstrings clearly state these functions determine if resampling is possible
   - is_subperiod checks for downsampling capability
   - is_superperiod checks for upsampling capability

2. Implied Symmetry Property:
   - While not explicitly documented, the mathematical relationship is clear:
   - If you can downsample from A to B, you must be able to upsample from B to A
   - These are inverse operations by definition

3. Actual Usage in Pandas:
   - Pandas DOES support resampling between D (daily) and B (business day) frequencies
   - The resample() method works in both directions (D->B and B->D)
   - This confirms that both operations are valid and supported

4. Related Issues:
   - GitHub issue #18553 discusses inconsistencies in is_subperiod behavior
   - The issue remains open with acknowledgment from core developers
   - No definitive statement that the current behavior is intentional

DOCUMENTATION VERDICT:
---------------------
The documentation, while minimal, is clear about what these functions should do. The functions are supposed to determine if resampling operations are possible. Since pandas demonstrably supports resampling between D and B frequencies in both directions, the functions should reflect this capability. The asymmetric behavior is not documented as intentional and contradicts the actual resampling capabilities of pandas.
