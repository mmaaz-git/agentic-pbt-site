## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments for:**
- Data loss occurs silently without warnings
- The behavior violates user expectations for data preservation
- Empty strings and NaN have different semantic meanings
- Other serialization formats (pickle, parquet) preserve this distinction
- The issue affects data integrity

**Arguments against:**
- This is a fundamental limitation of the Excel format, not a pandas bug
- Excel itself doesn't distinguish between empty cells and empty strings
- Workarounds exist (na_filter=False for partial cases)
- The behavior is consistent with how Excel works

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments for:**
- The Excel format inherently cannot distinguish empty strings from empty cells
- Fixing this would require non-standard Excel behavior
- The issue only affects edge cases (rows with only empty strings)
- Changing default behavior could break existing code

**Arguments against:**
- Data loss without warning is serious
- Users expect round-trip operations to preserve data
- The complete row loss is more severe than just conversion

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments for:**
- The behavior matches Excel's data model exactly
- Round-trip preservation was never promised in documentation
- The test assumes behavior that was never specified
- Excel format limitations are well-known

**Arguments against:**
- Users have reasonable expectations about data preservation
- The silent data loss is problematic
- Other libraries handle this better

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments for:**
- The main issue is lack of warning in documentation
- Users need to know about this limitation upfront
- The workarounds should be prominently documented
- Adding warnings would address most concerns

**Arguments against:**
- The actual behavior could be improved, not just documented
- Documentation alone doesn't prevent data loss

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments for:**
- Could add new parameters to handle empty strings specially
- Could implement metadata to distinguish empty strings from NaN
- This would be an enhancement rather than fixing broken behavior

**Arguments against:**
- The current behavior causes actual data loss
- This is more of a bug than a missing feature

### Analysis Summary

The core issue is that Excel's data model doesn't distinguish between empty strings and empty cells. When pandas writes empty strings to Excel, they become empty cells, which are then interpreted as NaN when reading back.

The more severe issue of complete row loss (when all values are empty strings) appears to be because Excel/openpyxl doesn't consider rows with only empty cells as actual data rows.

While this behavior is technically "correct" given Excel's limitations, it violates user expectations and causes silent data loss. The lack of documentation about this limitation is a significant problem.
