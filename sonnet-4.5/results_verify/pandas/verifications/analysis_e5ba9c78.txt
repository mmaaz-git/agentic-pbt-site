## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Unintuitive behavior**: Creating empty chunks serves no practical purpose in data interchange
2. **Consumer impact**: Libraries consuming the interchange protocol may not handle empty chunks correctly, leading to unexpected behavior or errors
3. **Logical inconsistency**: The purpose of chunking is to divide data, not to create empty containers
4. **Easy fix available**: The proposed fix is simple and would prevent the issue
5. **Property-based test failure**: The test's assertion that chunks should contain data is reasonable

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
1. The specification doesn't explicitly prohibit empty chunks
2. Technically, the code works as written - it creates n_chunks as requested

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. The specification doesn't explicitly state chunks must be non-empty
2. The behavior is deterministic and predictable based on the code
3. The user is requesting n_chunks that exceed available data

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
1. The behavior violates reasonable expectations
2. Empty chunks don't serve the purpose of data interchange
3. The test's assertion is sensible even if not explicitly documented

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. Edge case that rarely occurs in practice (requesting more chunks than rows)
2. Users can work around by checking row count before calling get_chunks

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
1. The fix is trivial (one-line change)
2. The issue could cause real problems for consumers
3. Not an obscure numerical precision issue - it's a logical problem

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The specification doesn't clearly define behavior for edge cases
2. Documentation could specify what happens when n_chunks > num_rows
3. The pandas implementation docstring is minimal

**Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code behavior is genuinely problematic, not just poorly documented
2. Documenting "creates empty chunks" wouldn't make it correct behavior
3. The issue is with implementation logic, not documentation clarity

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could be seen as requesting new behavior (capping chunks at row count)
2. The specification doesn't mandate this behavior

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. The current behavior is a bug in the implementation logic
3. Creating empty chunks is not a feature anyone would want

## Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. While the specification doesn't explicitly prohibit empty chunks, the current behavior:
1. Violates reasonable expectations about chunking
2. Serves no useful purpose
3. Can cause issues for consumers of the protocol
4. Has a trivial fix that improves the implementation

The fact that the specification is ambiguous doesn't make the behavior correct - it just means the specification could be clearer. The implementation should follow sensible behavior even when specifications are incomplete.
