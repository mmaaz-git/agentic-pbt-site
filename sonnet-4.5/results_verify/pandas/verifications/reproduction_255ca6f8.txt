BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The technical details are confirmed as follows:

1. TEST CASE REPRODUCTION:
   - Created two masked arrays with identical data and identical masks
   - x = ma.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], mask=[False, True, False])
   - y = ma.array([1.0, 999.0, 3.0], mask=[False, True, False])
   - The unmasked values (positions 0 and 2) are identical: [1.0, 3.0]
   - The masked value (position 1) differs (2.0 vs 999.0) but should be irrelevant

   RESULTS:
   - ma.allequal(x, y, fill_value=True) returns True (CORRECT - masked values treated as equal)
   - ma.allequal(x, y, fill_value=False) returns False (UNEXPECTED - unmasked values ARE equal)

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   The provided hypothesis test generates random arrays with identical data and masks, then tests if allequal with fill_value=False correctly compares them. The test FAILS consistently, confirming the bug. The test failures show that whenever there are ANY masked values, allequal(fill_value=False) returns False regardless of whether the unmasked values are equal.

3. SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS:
   Looking at the actual implementation in numpy/ma/core.py:
   ```python
   elif fill_value:
       # ... proper comparison logic ...
   else:
       return False  # This line is the bug!
   ```

   When fill_value=False and there are any masks, the function simply returns False without checking if the unmasked values are equal. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

4. EXPECTED VS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
   EXPECTED: When fill_value=False, the function should:
   - Compare all unmasked values for equality
   - Treat masked positions as NOT equal
   - Return True only if all unmasked values match AND masks are identical

   ACTUAL: When fill_value=False and any masks exist:
   - Returns False immediately without any comparison

The bug is 100% reproducible and the technical details in the bug report are accurate.
