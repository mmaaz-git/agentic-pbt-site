## Documentation Analysis for import_optional_dependency

I examined the source code of pandas.compat._optional.import_optional_dependency function. The function has a comprehensive docstring (lines 91-124) that clearly documents its behavior.

### Key Documentation Points:

1. **Function Purpose**: Import an optional dependency with version checking capabilities.

2. **Parameters Documentation**:
   - `errors` parameter has three options: 'raise', 'warn', 'ignore'
   - The docstring explicitly states for errors='ignore' (lines 110-113):
     > "ignore: If the module is not installed, return None, otherwise, return the module, even if the version is too old. It's expected that users validate the version locally when using errors='ignore' (see. io/html.py)"

3. **Return Value Documentation** (lines 117-124):
   - States that None is returned when:
     a) Package is not found and errors is False (this seems to be a typo - should say 'ignore' not False)
     b) Package's version is too old and errors is 'warn' or 'ignore'

   However, this directly contradicts the earlier statement in line 111 which says "return the module, even if the version is too old" for errors='ignore'.

### Internal Contradiction in Documentation:

There is a clear contradiction within the docstring itself:
- Line 111 says: "return the module, even if the version is too old" when errors='ignore'
- Lines 122-123 say: "None is returned... when the package's version is too old and errors is... 'ignore'"

These two statements are mutually exclusive and cannot both be true.

### Reference to io/html.py:

The documentation mentions "see. io/html.py" as an example of how to use errors='ignore' with local validation. However, when I searched io/html.py, I found no usage of import_optional_dependency with errors='ignore'. The file does use import_optional_dependency but without the errors parameter, meaning it defaults to 'raise'.

### Conclusion from Documentation:

The documentation itself is internally inconsistent about what should happen when errors='ignore' and the version is too old. One part says return the module, another part says return None. This makes it impossible to determine the correct behavior from documentation alone.
