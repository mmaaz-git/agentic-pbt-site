## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug as reported. Here are my findings:

### Code Review
Looking at the FrozenList.union implementation in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/indexes/frozen.py`:

1. The `union` method (lines 34-50) performs a concatenation operation using `super().__add__(other)`, which appends `other` to `self`.

2. The docstring for `union` (lines 35-47) has a clear inconsistency:
   - Line 36 correctly states: "Returns a FrozenList with other concatenated to the end of self."
   - Line 46 incorrectly states: "The collection difference between self and other."

3. For comparison, the `difference` method (lines 52-68) correctly implements set difference and has consistent documentation at line 64: "The collection difference between self and other."

### Test Execution
Running the provided reproduction code confirms the bug:

**Test 1 - union method:**
- Input: fl1 = [1, 2, 3], fl2 = [4, 5, 6]
- Actual output: fl1.union(fl2) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- This is concatenation, not difference

**Test 2 - difference method (for comparison):**
- Input: fl1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], fl2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
- Output: fl1.difference(fl2) = [1, 2]
- This correctly implements set difference

### Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. There is a clear documentation error in the FrozenList.union method's docstring. The Returns section (line 46) incorrectly describes the return value as "The collection difference between self and other" when it should describe it as a concatenation/union of the two lists. This appears to be a copy-paste error from the difference method's docstring.
