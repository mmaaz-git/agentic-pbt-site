Bug Report Triage Analysis
==========================

Considering each possible categorization:

INVALID (Code works as documented)
-----------------------------------
Arguments against INVALID:
- The documentation examples show round-trip patterns without any warnings
- Users have reasonable expectations based on the examples
- The behavior violates common programming patterns for serialization

Possible argument for INVALID:
- Documentation never explicitly guarantees type preservation
- The parameters dtype and convert_axes are documented as defaulting to True
- Type inference is technically working as designed

Assessment: WEAK case for INVALID - while technically correct, the documentation misleads users

WONTFIX (Trivial or obscure issue)
-----------------------------------
Arguments against WONTFIX:
- This affects common use cases (financial data, IDs, postal codes)
- The issue is not obscure - it happens with simple values like 0.0
- Data type preservation is important for many applications

Possible argument for WONTFIX:
- Workaround exists (dtype=False, convert_axes=False)
- Changing defaults would break backward compatibility

Assessment: NOT appropriate for WONTFIX - this is a significant issue affecting real usage

FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality needed)
-------------------------------------------
Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Adding a roundtrip=True parameter would be new functionality
- Adding a from_json() classmethod would be new functionality
- Current behavior might be considered "working as designed"

Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Users expect round-trip to work based on documentation examples
- This is fixing unexpected behavior, not adding new capabilities

Assessment: POSSIBLE but not ideal - feels more like fixing a design flaw than adding features

DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation needs updating)
------------------------------------------------
Strong arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- Documentation examples imply round-trip works without caveats
- No warnings about type changes during round-trips
- Examples should show dtype=False, convert_axes=False for true round-trips
- The implicit contract created by examples is violated

Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation
- Users reasonably expect round-trip to preserve types

Assessment: STRONG case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX - documentation creates false expectations

BUG (Code behavior is incorrect)
---------------------------------
Arguments for BUG:
- Violates principle of least surprise
- Round-trip serialization should preserve data fidelity
- Examples in documentation don't work as shown for all data
- Affects real-world use cases significantly

Arguments against BUG:
- Code works as technically documented (dtype=True by default)
- Type inference is an intentional feature
- Never explicitly promised type preservation

Assessment: MODERATE case for BUG - depends on whether we view this as a design flaw

Final Analysis
--------------
This issue falls into a gray area between DOCUMENTATION_FIX and BUG. The code technically
works as designed with type inference enabled by default. However, the documentation
creates strong expectations through its examples that round-trip operations work seamlessly.

The most appropriate categorization is DOCUMENTATION_FIX because:
1. The code behavior is intentional (type inference is a feature)
2. The documentation misleads users with round-trip examples
3. The fix is to update documentation to show proper round-trip usage
4. A code fix would require changing long-standing defaults (breaking change)

The documentation should be updated to:
- Show dtype=False, convert_axes=False in round-trip examples
- Add warnings about type changes with default parameters
- Explain when and why type inference occurs
