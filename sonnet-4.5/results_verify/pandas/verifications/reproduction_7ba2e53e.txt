REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

1. Manual Reproduction Test:
   - Created two arrays of different lengths: [0] and [0, 0]
   - Applied hash_array to get hash arrays of lengths 1 and 2
   - Called combine_hash_arrays with these mismatched-length arrays
   - Result: ValueError with message "non-broadcastable output operand with shape (1,) doesn't match the broadcast shape (2,)"
   - This matches exactly what the bug report claimed

2. Hypothesis Test Reproduction:
   - Ran the provided hypothesis test with the specific failing example [[0], [0, 0]]
   - The test fails with the same ValueError
   - The error occurs at line 74 in combine_hash_arrays: out ^= a
   - This is a NumPy broadcasting error when trying to XOR arrays of different shapes

3. Root Cause Analysis:
   - The function starts by creating 'out' with shape matching the first array (line 70)
   - When it tries to XOR 'out' with subsequent arrays at line 74, NumPy's broadcasting rules fail if the arrays have different shapes
   - The function never validates that all input arrays have the same length

4. Effect of the Bug:
   - Any call to combine_hash_arrays with arrays of different lengths will crash with a confusing NumPy broadcasting error
   - The error message doesn't clearly indicate the actual problem (length mismatch)
   - Users may not understand what went wrong without examining the source code

The bug is confirmed and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
