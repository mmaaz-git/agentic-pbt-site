## Reproduction Analysis for pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer Bug

### Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report. The bug is reproducible and the technical details are correct.

### Key Findings

1. **Bug Confirmed**: The function `length_of_indexer` returns negative values for certain slice configurations, specifically when the slice would produce an empty result.

2. **Failing Cases Verified**:
   - `slice(1, None, None)` on empty array returns -1 instead of 0
   - `slice(5, 10, None)` on empty array returns -5 instead of 0
   - `slice(5, None, None)` on array of length 3 returns -2 instead of 0
   - `slice(3, 2, None)` on array of length 5 returns -1 instead of 0
   - Out-of-bounds slices return large negative values (e.g., -90)

3. **Root Cause Identified**: The formula `(stop - start + step - 1) // step` produces negative values when `start >= stop`. This happens in several scenarios:
   - When the slice starts beyond the array bounds
   - When the slice has `start > stop` (backwards slice with positive step)
   - When slicing an empty array with any positive start value

4. **Comparison with NumPy/Python Behavior**: NumPy and Python correctly return empty sequences (length 0) for these slices. The `length_of_indexer` function should match this behavior.

5. **Mathematical Invariant Violation**: The function violates the fundamental mathematical invariant that a length (count of elements) must be non-negative. The concept of "negative length" is undefined in mathematics and computer science.

6. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test from the bug report correctly identifies the issue and fails on the first example (`start=1, stop=None, step=None, target_len=0`).

### Impact Assessment

The bug is real and could cause problems in downstream code that:
- Assumes lengths are non-negative (a reasonable assumption)
- Uses the length for array allocation (would crash on negative size)
- Performs arithmetic with the length value
- Compares lengths for validation

### Proposed Fix Verification

The bug report suggests using `max(0, (stop - start + step - 1) // step)` which would ensure non-negative results. This is a reasonable fix that maintains the existing calculation but clamps negative values to 0.
