## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
Both `is_subperiod` and `is_superperiod` are documented functions in pandas.tseries.frequencies with clear docstrings:

**is_subperiod**: "Returns True if downsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"
**is_superperiod**: "Returns True if upsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"

### Key Documentation Insights

1. **Inverse Relationship Expectation**
   - The documentation clearly states these functions check if upsampling (is_superperiod) or downsampling (is_subperiod) is "possible"
   - While not explicitly stated, there's a strong mathematical implication that these should be inverses:
     - If upsampling from A to B is possible, then downsampling from B to A must be possible
     - This is a fundamental property of frequency relationships

2. **Identity Case (freq to freq)**
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly address what should happen when source equals target
   - However, logically:
     - Neither upsampling nor downsampling is needed when frequencies are identical
     - Both operations should either be considered "possible" (trivially) or "not needed"
     - Consistency is expected - both functions should return the same value for identity cases

3. **No External Documentation Found**
   - These functions are not in the main pandas API documentation (searched extensively)
   - They appear to be part of the internal/utility API (tseries.frequencies module)
   - No RFC or external specification was referenced

### Mathematical Consistency
The bug report correctly identifies a violation of mathematical consistency:
- For any frequency relationship, if `is_superperiod(A, B)` is True, then `is_subperiod(B, A)` should also be True
- This is a fundamental property that users would reasonably expect
- The current behavior violates this for annual frequencies

### Conclusion
The documentation, while minimal, combined with the function names and their described purposes, strongly suggests that:
1. These functions should maintain an inverse relationship
2. When comparing a frequency to itself, both functions should return the same value
3. The current inconsistent behavior for annual frequencies is not intentional or documented
