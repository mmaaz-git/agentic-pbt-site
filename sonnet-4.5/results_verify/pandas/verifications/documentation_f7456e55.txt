## Documentation Analysis for _arrow_dtype_mapping

### Function Documentation
1. **Function Status**: `_arrow_dtype_mapping()` is a private/internal function (indicated by leading underscore)
2. **No Public Documentation**: The function has no docstring and is not part of the public pandas API
3. **Purpose**: Based on code analysis, this function creates a mapping from PyArrow data types to pandas nullable extension dtypes

### Official Documentation References
1. **PyArrow Integration** (pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/pyarrow.html):
   - Shows example dtype mappings including `pa.string(): pd.StringDtype()`
   - Does not mention duplicate entries or specify that pa.string() should appear twice

2. **Apache Arrow Documentation** (arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/datatypes.html):
   - `pa.string()`: UTF8 variable-length string type (32-bit offsets)
   - `pa.large_string()`: Large UTF8 variable-length string type (64-bit offsets)
   - These are distinct types meant for different use cases

### Expected Behavior Based on Documentation
1. **Distinct Types**: `pa.string()` and `pa.large_string()` are different PyArrow types
2. **Both Map to Same pandas Type**: Both correctly map to `pd.StringDtype()` since pandas doesn't distinguish between regular and large strings
3. **No Duplicate Keys Expected**: Dictionary should have one entry per unique PyArrow type

### Documentation Findings
1. **No specification for duplicate keys**: Documentation does not indicate that pa.string() should appear twice in the mapping
2. **Clear distinction**: Documentation shows pa.string() and pa.large_string() as separate, distinct types
3. **Mapping behavior**: The mapping of both string types to pd.StringDtype() is correct and expected
4. **Code quality**: Python best practices and the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) suggest duplicate dictionary keys are unintended

### Conclusion
The documentation provides no justification for having duplicate `pa.string()` keys in the mapping dictionary. The presence of both `pa.string()` and `pa.large_string()` mapping to the same pandas dtype is correct, but having `pa.string()` appear twice (lines 41 and 44) appears to be an unintentional duplication that violates code quality standards.
