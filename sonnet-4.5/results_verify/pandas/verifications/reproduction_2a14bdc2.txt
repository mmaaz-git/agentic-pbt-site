Bug Reproduction Report
======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

## Simple Reproduction Test

When running the provided reproduction code:
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})
df.rolling(window=2, method='invalid_method')
```

The error message produced is:
```
ValueError: method must be 'table' or 'single
```

Analysis of the error message:
- The error message contains 3 single quotes (odd number)
- This indicates unmatched quotes
- The message starts with "method must be 'table' or 'single" but is missing the closing single quote after 'single'

## Property-Based Test with Hypothesis

The property-based test fails as expected:
- The test generates various invalid method values
- For each invalid method, it checks if the error message has properly matched quotes
- The test fails with: "AssertionError: Unmatched quotes in error message: method must be 'table' or 'single"
- This confirms that the error message consistently has unmatched quotes for all invalid method values

## Source Code Verification

I examined the actual pandas source code at:
/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/window/rolling.py

Line 208 contains:
```python
raise ValueError("method must be 'table' or 'single")
```

The closing single quote is indeed missing. It should be:
```python
raise ValueError("method must be 'table' or 'single'")
```

## Conclusion

The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The error message for invalid method parameters in pandas.core.window.rolling.BaseWindow._validate has an unmatched quote due to a missing closing single quote character in the string literal.
