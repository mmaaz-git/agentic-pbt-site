## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation (from source code docstring)

The `clean_column_name` function's docstring explicitly states:

1. **Purpose**: "Function to emulate the cleaning of a backtick quoted name" - it processes identifiers to make them valid Python identifiers after being parsed inside backtick quoted strings.

2. **Contract for error handling** (lines 120-122):
   - "For some cases, a name cannot be converted to a valid Python identifier."
   - "In that case :func:`tokenize_string` raises a SyntaxError."
   - "In that case, we just return the name unmodified."

3. **Key behavior**: When tokenization fails with a SyntaxError, the function should return the original name unmodified rather than propagating the error.

### Python Tokenizer Documentation

From Python's tokenize module documentation:
- `TokenError` is raised when "either a docstring or expression that may be split over several lines is not completed anywhere in the file"
- The specific error "source code cannot contain null bytes" is a TokenError raised by Python's tokenizer when it encounters null bytes (\x00) in source code
- This is distinct from SyntaxError, which represents broader parsing errors

### Documentation Gap

The function's documentation specifically mentions that `tokenize_string` raises a `SyntaxError` when tokenization fails, and that this error is caught. However:

1. The documentation doesn't mention that `TokenError` can also be raised by the underlying tokenizer
2. Python's tokenizer raises `TokenError` (not `SyntaxError`) when encountering null bytes
3. The current implementation only catches `SyntaxError`, not `TokenError`

### Conclusion

The documentation establishes a clear contract: when tokenization fails, the function should return the name unmodified. The bug violates this documented contract because:

1. The function promises to handle tokenization failures gracefully
2. Null bytes cause a tokenization failure (TokenError)
3. The function crashes instead of returning the name unmodified

The documentation's statement that "tokenize_string raises a SyntaxError" is incomplete - it should also mention TokenError as another possible exception from tokenization failures.
