BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable.

## Hypothesis Test Results

The Hypothesis test failed immediately with the input '[' and other invalid regex patterns. The test was designed to verify that is_re_compilable always returns a bool value, but instead it raised re.PatternError exceptions.

Falsifying example found: s='['
Exception raised: re.PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0

## Simple Test Results

Testing the specific cases mentioned in the bug report all raised exceptions instead of returning False:

- Input ')': Raised PatternError: unbalanced parenthesis at position 0
- Input '?': Raised PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Input '*': Raised PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Input '+': Raised PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Input '(': Raised PatternError: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0
- Input '[': Raised PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0
- Input '\': Raised PatternError: bad escape (end of pattern) at position 0

## Source Code Analysis

The current implementation in pandas/core/dtypes/inference.py (lines 166-192) shows:

```python
def is_re_compilable(obj) -> bool:
    try:
        re.compile(obj)
    except TypeError:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

The function only catches TypeError but not re.error (or its subclass re.PatternError), which is raised when an invalid regex pattern is passed to re.compile().

## Effect

This bug causes is_re_compilable to violate its documented contract of always returning a bool. Instead of returning False for invalid regex patterns, it propagates re.PatternError exceptions to the caller. This breaks the expected behavior where the function should be a safe way to check if something can be compiled as a regex without having to handle exceptions.
