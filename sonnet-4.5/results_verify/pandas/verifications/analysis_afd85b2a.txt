# Bug Triage Analysis

## Considering BUG
**Arguments for:**
- The function mutates its input array, which violates standard pandas/numpy conventions
- When used through MaskedArray._accumulate(), it corrupts the internal state of the MaskedArray object
- The mutation is a side effect that happens before the main operation, not as the result
- There's no parameter to control this behavior (no copy=True/False option)
- Other pandas functions that modify inputs have explicit `inplace` parameters or naming conventions
- The numpy functions being wrapped (np.cumsum, etc.) do NOT mutate their inputs
- This can cause subtle bugs in user code that doesn't expect mutation

**Arguments against:**
- The docstring does say "We will modify values in place"

## Considering INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- The docstring explicitly states the values will be modified in place
- This is an internal function (starts with underscore) not meant for direct public use

**Arguments against:**
- The docstring is ambiguous about whether it means modifying the input vs internal modification
- Even internal functions shouldn't corrupt object state unexpectedly
- The function is exposed through the public API via MaskedArray methods
- "In place" could refer to the algorithm's internal workings, not the API contract

## Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- This might be a performance optimization to avoid copying arrays
- The function is internal (underscore prefix)
- Fixing it might break backward compatibility

**Arguments against:**
- This causes actual corruption of MaskedArray objects
- The performance benefit of not copying is minimal compared to the accumulation operation itself
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects all masked accumulation operations

## Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- The docstring does mention modification, but it's not clear enough
- Better documentation could warn users about this behavior

**Arguments against:**
- The behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation
- Even with perfect documentation, corrupting object state is still a bug
- Users calling MaskedArray.cumsum() wouldn't see this internal documentation

## Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Adding a `copy` parameter to control the behavior could be a feature

**Arguments against:**
- Not mutating inputs is the expected default behavior, not a new feature
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

## Conclusion
This is a **BUG**. While the docstring mentions "modify values in place", this appears to be describing an internal implementation detail rather than an intended API contract. The mutation:
1. Violates standard pandas/numpy conventions
2. Corrupts the internal state of MaskedArray objects
3. Has no way to be avoided (no copy parameter)
4. Differs from the behavior of the wrapped numpy functions
5. Can cause subtle bugs in production code

The fix is simple (add `values = values.copy()` at the start) and would align the behavior with user expectations and pandas/numpy conventions.
