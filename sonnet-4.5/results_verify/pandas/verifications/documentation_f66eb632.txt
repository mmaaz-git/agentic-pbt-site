## Documentation Analysis for register_extension_dtype

### Official Documentation Review

1. **pandas.api.extensions.register_extension_dtype Documentation**:
   - The official documentation is minimal and only states: "Register an ExtensionType with pandas as class decorator. This enables operations like `.astype(name)` for the name of the ExtensionDtype."
   - **No mention of duplicate names**: The documentation does not specify what happens when multiple dtypes with the same name are registered
   - **No mention of override behavior**: There is no documentation about whether subsequent registrations override previous ones or are ignored
   - **No warnings mentioned**: Unlike register_series_accessor, the documentation does not mention any warnings

2. **Source Code Analysis**:
   - The `Registry.register()` method (lines 520-529 in base.py) simply appends new dtypes to the list without checking for duplicates
   - The `Registry.find()` method (lines 549-580) returns the first matching dtype it finds
   - There is no duplicate detection or warning mechanism in the current implementation

3. **Comparison with Similar Functions**:
   - `register_series_accessor` explicitly documents and implements warning behavior: "A warning is issued if this name conflicts with a preexisting attribute"
   - The implementation shows it uses `warnings.warn()` when `hasattr(cls, name)` is true
   - This creates an inconsistency in the pandas API between different registration functions

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation for `register_extension_dtype` is incomplete because it:
1. Does not specify the expected behavior for duplicate registrations
2. Does not mention that only the first registered dtype with a given name will be retrievable
3. Does not warn users about the silent failure of subsequent registrations
4. Is inconsistent with similar registration functions that do handle duplicates

### Expected Behavior

Based on pandas design patterns and the behavior of similar functions like `register_series_accessor`, users would reasonably expect:
1. Either a warning when registering a duplicate name (like register_series_accessor)
2. Or the ability to override an existing registration (like dictionary behavior)
3. At minimum, some indication that the registration was ineffective

The current silent failure violates the principle of least surprise and makes debugging difficult.
