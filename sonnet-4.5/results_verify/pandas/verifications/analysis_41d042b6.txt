## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Category: BUG
**Arguments For:**
1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The docstring explicitly states the function raises ValueError for invalid column names. Empty strings are invalid Excel column names, yet the function returns -1 instead of raising ValueError.
2. **Incorrect Return Value**: The function returns a negative index (-1) which doesn't make semantic sense for column indices that should be 0 or positive.
3. **Real-World Impact**: The bug affects downstream functions like _range2cols which can propagate negative indices, potentially causing IndexErrors or silent bugs in user code.
4. **Specification Violation**: Excel itself treats empty column names as invalid and replaces them with placeholders. The function should follow Excel's behavior.
5. **Reproducible and Deterministic**: The bug consistently occurs for all empty/whitespace inputs.
6. **Reasonable User Expectation**: Users would expect an error for invalid input rather than a nonsensical negative index.

**Arguments Against:**
- None. This is a clear bug that violates the documented contract.

### Category: INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- None. The bug report is accurate and well-documented.

**Arguments Against:**
1. The bug exists and is reproducible
2. The documentation clearly states ValueError should be raised
3. The behavior violates reasonable expectations

### Category: WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
1. It's an internal function (starts with underscore)
2. Users might not directly call this function

**Arguments Against:**
1. Even internal functions should maintain their documented contracts
2. The bug affects public-facing functionality through _range2cols
3. The fix is simple and low-risk
4. Negative indices can cause real problems in downstream code
5. This is not an obscure edge case - empty strings can easily occur in user input

### Category: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- None. The documentation already specifies the expected behavior.

**Arguments Against:**
1. This isn't asking for new functionality
2. The docstring already documents that ValueError should be raised
3. This is fixing existing broken behavior, not adding features

### Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
1. One could argue the documentation should explicitly mention empty strings

**Arguments Against:**
1. The documentation already covers this case: "invalid column name" clearly includes empty strings
2. The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
3. Excel's own behavior confirms empty strings are invalid
4. The function should raise ValueError as documented, not return -1

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function violates its documented contract by returning -1 for empty/whitespace strings instead of raising ValueError. This is not a documentation issue, feature request, or trivial edge case. The bug:

1. Violates the explicit docstring contract
2. Returns nonsensical negative indices
3. Can cause real problems in downstream code
4. Is easily triggered by user input
5. Has a straightforward fix

The bug report is well-written, includes reproducible test cases, explains the impact, and even provides a fix. This should remain open as a valid BUG.
