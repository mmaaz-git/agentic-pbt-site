## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation does not explicitly state that cumsum() must work with non-null fill values. One could argue that sparse arrays with non-null fill values are an edge case, and the documentation's statement that "fill value will be np.nan regardless" could be interpreted as a requirement that the input should have null fill values. The phrase "cumulative sum of non-NA/null values" is ambiguous and could mean the method is only designed for arrays where the fill value is NA/null.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The method signature accepts any SparseArray without restrictions on fill_value. The documentation explicitly says the result will have fill_value=np.nan "regardless" of the input, strongly implying it should handle any input fill_value. The code has an explicit branch for handling non-null fill values (line 1549), showing intent to support them. A RecursionError is clearly a crash bug, not intended behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered an obscure edge case that rarely occurs in practice. Most users of sparse arrays likely use np.nan as the fill value (the default for floating-point arrays). The workaround is simple: convert to dense array first or use np.nan as fill_value. Fixing this might require significant refactoring for minimal benefit.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Infinite recursion causing a complete crash is a severe bug that should never occur in production code. The fix is trivial (one line change) as shown in the report. Sparse arrays with integer dtypes default to fill_value=0, making this a common scenario. The code already attempts to handle this case but has a clear implementation error.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to explicitly state that cumsum() only works with null fill values, warning users about the limitation. The current documentation is ambiguous about what "non-NA/null values" means and doesn't clearly specify supported fill values.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code clearly intends to handle non-null fill values (there's explicit logic for it). The issue is not a documentation problem but an implementation bug - infinite recursion is never acceptable behavior. The documentation already implies all fill values should work by stating the output will have np.nan "regardless."

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that supporting non-null fill values is a new feature that was never properly implemented. The current code path for non-null fill values appears to be a placeholder that doesn't work. This could be framed as requesting proper support for cumsum on integer sparse arrays.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The code already has logic attempting to handle non-null fill values - it's just broken. This is not asking for new functionality but fixing existing code that crashes. The method accepts these inputs without error checking, indicating they should be supported.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a clear case of infinite recursion caused by a simple logic error. The code attempts to handle non-null fill values but creates an infinite loop. The fix is trivial and obvious: call cumsum() on the numpy array instead of the SparseArray wrapper. The documentation implies this should work, and the code tries to make it work but fails due to a programming error. Crashes with RecursionError are always bugs.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if the documentation explicitly stated that non-null fill values are unsupported, which it doesn't. Even then, the code should raise a clear error message rather than crashing with recursion.

**Overall consideration**
This is unequivocally a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming: the code has explicit logic to handle non-null fill values (line 1549-1550), but this logic contains a clear programming error causing infinite recursion. When `self._null_fill_value` is False, it calls `SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()`, which creates a new SparseArray with the same non-null fill value and calls cumsum() again, repeating infinitely. 

The documentation states the output fill value will be np.nan "regardless" of input, clearly indicating all fill values should be supported. Sparse integer arrays default to fill_value=0, making this a common use case, not an edge case. The crash is severe (complete failure with RecursionError) and the fix is trivial (call cumsum on the numpy array).

Most importantly, this cannot be dismissed as undefined behavior or a feature request - the code explicitly tries to handle this case but fails due to a simple implementation error. Any method that accepts certain inputs without validation but then crashes with infinite recursion when processing those inputs is exhibiting a bug, not missing functionality or documentation issues.
