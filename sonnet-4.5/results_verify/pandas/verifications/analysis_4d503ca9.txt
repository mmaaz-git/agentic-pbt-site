## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function crashes with a KeyError when called without "_" in parts
- The docstring says "_" will be filtered but doesn't require it to be present
- The code unconditionally deletes "_" without checking if it exists
- The proposed fix is simple and makes the code more robust
- Even though it's an internal function, it could be used in future refactoring or extensions

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Function is internal (starts with underscore)
- All current uses include "_" in the parts list
- The crash only happens with inputs that are never used in practice
- The SAS XPORT format itself may require these padding fields

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an internal function not part of the public API
- All existing callers correctly include "_" in their parts
- The bug would never occur in normal operation
- The function works correctly for its intended use case
- Fixing it adds unnecessary defensive code for a scenario that shouldn't happen

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (one-line change)
- Making the code more robust is generally good practice
- The docstring implies filtering, not requiring "_"

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue the function's contract implicitly requires "_" based on its usage pattern
- Internal functions may have unstated preconditions

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function does crash with a clear error
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state "_" is required
- The code behavior doesn't match the documentation's implication

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- The docstring could be clearer about whether "_" is required or optional
- The documentation says "will be filtered" which implies optional handling
- Updating the docs to say "_" is required would clarify the contract

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is genuinely buggy, not just poorly documented
- The unconditional delete is a code issue, not a documentation issue

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Supporting parts without "_" could be seen as a new feature
- The function was never designed to handle this case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a bug - the code crashes unexpectedly
- Not a request for new functionality, but fixing existing broken behavior

### Final Assessment:

This is a **WONTFIX** case. While technically a bug, it's in an internal function that's working correctly for all its actual use cases. The function is private (underscore prefix), only used internally within the SAS XPORT reader, and all current callers correctly provide "_" in their parts lists. The bug would never surface in production use, and fixing it would add defensive code for a scenario that shouldn't occur. This falls under "obscure error cases that would never happen in practice" for an internal library function.
