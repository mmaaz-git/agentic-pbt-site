## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the validate_integer function. Here are my findings:

### 1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction

The property-based test using Hypothesis correctly identifies the inconsistency. When running the test with negative values and a positive min_val:
- The test fails with input val=-1, min_val=0
- The assertion "Float -1.0 should raise ValueError" fails
- This confirms that float inputs bypass the min_val check

### 2. Manual Example Reproduction

The manual test case produces exactly the output claimed in the bug report:
- Integer -5 with min_val=0: Correctly raises ValueError with message "'test_param' must be an integer >=0"
- Float -5.0 with min_val=0: Incorrectly returns -5 without raising an error

### 3. Code Analysis

Examining the source code at pandas/io/parsers/readers.py lines 548-554 reveals the logic flaw:

```python
msg = f"'{name:s}' must be an integer >={min_val:d}"
if is_float(val):
    if int(val) != val:
        raise ValueError(msg)
    val = int(val)  # Converts float to int but doesn't check min_val
elif not (is_integer(val) and val >= min_val):
    raise ValueError(msg)
```

The bug occurs because:
1. When a float is detected (line 549), the code checks if it can be safely converted to an integer (line 550)
2. If it can, it converts the float to int (line 552)
3. However, it never checks if this converted integer satisfies the min_val constraint
4. The min_val check only happens in the elif branch (line 553) for actual integer inputs

### Effect

This bug creates an inconsistency where semantically identical values (-5 vs -5.0) produce different behavior when a min_val constraint is specified. This violates the principle of least surprise and the documented contract of the function.
