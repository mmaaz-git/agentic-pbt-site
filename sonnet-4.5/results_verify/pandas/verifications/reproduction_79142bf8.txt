## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for `pandas.compat.is_platform_power`.

### Steps Taken to Reproduce:

1. **Examined the source code of `pandas.compat.is_platform_power`:**
   - Located in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/compat/__init__.py`, lines 118-127
   - The function implementation correctly checks for Power architecture: `platform.machine() in ("ppc64", "ppc64le")`
   - The docstring summary correctly states: "Checking if the running platform use Power architecture"
   - However, the Returns section incorrectly states: "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture"

2. **Compared with the `is_platform_arm` function (lines 104-115):**
   - The `is_platform_arm` function has nearly identical docstring structure
   - Its Returns section correctly states: "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture"
   - This confirms the bug is a copy-paste error from `is_platform_arm` to `is_platform_power`

3. **Ran the property-based test provided in the bug report:**
   - The test correctly fails with an assertion error
   - The test checks that if "ARM architecture" appears in the source, then "Power architecture" should appear in the Returns section
   - Test output confirms "ARM architecture" is present in the source but refers to the wrong architecture

### Bug Effect:

The bug is a documentation inconsistency where:
- Function name: `is_platform_power` (correct)
- Function summary: "Checking if the running platform use Power architecture" (correct)
- Function implementation: checks for `ppc64` and `ppc64le` (correct - these are Power architectures)
- Returns documentation: "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture" (INCORRECT - should be Power)

The code functionality is correct; only the documentation string is wrong. This is clearly a copy-paste error from the `is_platform_arm` function that appears just above it in the same file.
