BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   FOR:
   - The function returns mathematically incorrect results for range objects
   - The formula (stop - start) // step is wrong; should be ceiling division
   - Causes incorrect behavior in pandas indexing operations
   - Inconsistent with how the same function handles slices (uses correct formula)
   - Python's len(range(...)) returns the correct value, but this function doesn't
   - Multiple test cases fail, including simple cases like range(0, 1, 2)
   - The bug affects a core utility used by pandas indexing operations
   AGAINST:
   - Function is internal/private (not public API)
   - No existing tests for range objects suggest it may not be a priority use case

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
   FOR:
   - Could argue the function was never meant to handle range objects correctly
   - No documentation explicitly states range objects should work
   AGAINST:
   - The function explicitly has a branch for range objects (line 325-326)
   - The implementation is clearly attempting to calculate range length
   - The formula used is objectively wrong mathematically
   - Function name "length_of_indexer" clearly implies it should return correct length

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
   FOR:
   - Range objects might be rarely used as indexers in pandas
   - Internal function not part of public API
   AGAINST:
   - This is a correctness issue that silently returns wrong results
   - Could cause data corruption in indexing operations
   - The fix is trivial (just use len(indexer))
   - Not an edge case - fails for common range patterns

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
   FOR:
   - Could argue proper range support is a new feature
   AGAINST:
   - The function already attempts to handle ranges (has explicit code for it)
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capability
   - The current code is trying to calculate range length but does it wrong

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
   FOR:
   - Documentation doesn't specify how ranges should be handled
   AGAINST:
   - The code is mathematically incorrect, not just poorly documented
   - Even without documentation, length_of_indexer(range(0,1,2)) should obviously return 1, not 0
   - This is a code bug, not a documentation problem

VERDICT: BUG

This is clearly a valid bug. The function has explicit code to handle range objects but uses an incorrect formula. The bug causes the function to return wrong values for a basic operation (getting the length of a range). While the function is internal, it's used by other pandas code and the incorrectness could propagate. The fix is simple and correct (use Python's built-in len() for ranges).
