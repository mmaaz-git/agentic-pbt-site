Bug Reproduction Results
========================

1. Test Input:
   - Array: ['', '', '\x00']
   - Three elements: two empty strings and one null byte character
   - Verified: '' (empty string) and '\x00' (null byte) are DIFFERENT values
     - '' has length 0
     - '\x00' has length 1 (contains a single null byte character, ord value 0)

2. Reproduction Results:

   With categorize=True:
   - Hash values: [1760245841805064774, 1760245841805064774, 1760245841805064774]
   - ALL THREE values get the SAME hash
   - This includes both empty strings AND the null byte getting identical hashes

   With categorize=False:
   - Hash values: [1760245841805064774, 1760245841805064774, 7984136654223058057]
   - The two empty strings correctly get the same hash (1760245841805064774)
   - The null byte correctly gets a different hash (7984136654223058057)

3. Bug Confirmation:
   - The bug report is TECHNICALLY CORRECT
   - With categorize=True, different values ('' and '\x00') receive the same hash
   - With categorize=False, the behavior is correct
   - The hypothesis test fails as reported

4. Impact Analysis:
   - This is a real difference in behavior between categorize=True and categorize=False
   - The null byte character '\x00' is incorrectly hashed to the same value as empty string when categorize=True
   - This violates the basic principle that different inputs should produce different hashes

5. Test Validity:
   - The test case is valid and minimal
   - The strings being compared are genuinely different
   - The behavior difference is reproducible and consistent
