## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function relies on NumPy's dtype conversion, and NumPy intentionally treats None as float64. One could argue that pandas_dtype is simply a wrapper around numpy's dtype conversion and inherits its behavior. The documentation doesn't explicitly state that None should be rejected - it only says "TypeError if not a dtype", and since numpy considers None convertible to a dtype, it could be argued that None is implicitly valid.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation clearly states the function should raise TypeError "if not a dtype", and None is definitively not a dtype - it's a null value. The internal function _get_dtype explicitly rejects None with a clear error message, showing that pandas developers have already decided None should not be accepted. The fact that is_dtype_equal(None, None) returns False also shows None is not considered a valid dtype in the pandas ecosystem.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case where users are passing None to a dtype conversion function, which is arguably a programming error on the user's part. The current behavior has likely existed for a long time, and changing it could break existing code that inadvertently relies on None being converted to float64. The impact of this bug is minimal as it only affects code that's already doing something questionable (passing None as a dtype).

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency between pandas_dtype and _get_dtype is confusing and could lead to subtle bugs. The issue isn't trivial because it creates an API inconsistency within the same module. The fix is simple and aligns the public API with the internal behavior. Other dtype functions already treat None specially, so this would make the API more consistent overall.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior of accepting None and returning float64 could be considered a feature that's just poorly documented. The documentation could be updated to state "None is converted to float64" as a special case. This would preserve backward compatibility while clarifying the behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation already states the expected behavior clearly - raise TypeError if not a dtype. The internal function _get_dtype shows the intended design is to reject None. Changing the documentation to match the buggy behavior would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it. The inconsistency with _get_dtype would remain even if documented.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that the current bug report is actually requesting a new feature - stricter None checking in pandas_dtype. The current behavior might be considered "working as designed" through numpy, and adding None checking would be an enhancement for better error handling.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality but rather asking for the function to behave as documented. The documentation already promises TypeError for invalid inputs, and _get_dtype already implements this check. This is about fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation explicitly states TypeError should be raised "if not a dtype", and None is clearly not a dtype. There's a clear inconsistency between pandas_dtype and _get_dtype, where the latter explicitly checks for None and raises an appropriate error. The fact that is_dtype_equal treats None as invalid shows that None should not be considered a valid dtype in pandas. The bug creates surprising behavior where None silently becomes float64, which could mask programming errors.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function is working as implemented - it delegates to numpy's dtype conversion which accepts None. This behavior has likely existed for years without causing major issues. The documentation could be interpreted as "raises TypeError if the conversion fails", and since numpy's conversion succeeds, no error is raised.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a documentation inconsistency issue rather than a clear bug. The key factors are:

First, the behavior divergence between pandas_dtype and _get_dtype is real and confusing. However, _get_dtype is an internal function (indicated by the underscore prefix), and internal functions often have stricter validation than public APIs. The public API pandas_dtype delegates to NumPy's dtype conversion, which has its own established behavior of treating None as float64. This isn't a pandas decision but rather inheriting NumPy's behavior.

Second, while the documentation says "Raises TypeError if not a dtype", this could be interpreted as "raises TypeError if the dtype conversion fails" rather than "raises TypeError if the input is not already a dtype object". Since NumPy successfully converts None to float64, the conversion doesn't fail, so no error is raised. The documentation is ambiguous enough that the current behavior could be considered compliant.

Third, changing this behavior would be a breaking change. Code that currently works (even if accidentally) by passing None and getting float64 would suddenly start raising exceptions. This kind of breaking change requires strong justification, and the harm caused by the current behavior seems minimal. Users passing None to a dtype function are already doing something questionable, and getting float64 as a default isn't necessarily worse than getting an error.

The most appropriate resolution would be to update the documentation to clarify that None is converted to float64 (following NumPy's behavior), making the special case explicit rather than trying to change long-standing behavior that may have unknown dependencies in user code.
