DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

SOURCE CODE DOCSTRING:
---------------------
The function's docstring in the source code states:
"""
Check if the object can be compiled into a regex pattern instance.

Parameters
----------
obj : The object to check

Returns
-------
bool
    Whether `obj` can be compiled as a regex pattern.

Examples
--------
>>> from pandas.api.types import is_re_compilable
>>> is_re_compilable(".*")
True
>>> is_re_compilable(1)
False
"""

OFFICIAL PANDAS DOCUMENTATION:
-----------------------------
The official documentation at https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable.html states:
- Description: "Check if the object can be compiled into a regex pattern instance."
- Returns: "Returns a boolean indicating whether the object can be compiled as a regex pattern"
- Key point: "The function is useful for validating potential regex patterns before attempting compilation,
  helping prevent runtime errors when working with regular expressions in pandas."

DOCUMENTATION INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------
1. The function name "is_re_compilable" clearly indicates it's a predicate function that should return
   a boolean value indicating whether something CAN be compiled as a regex.

2. The documentation explicitly states it returns a bool - "Whether `obj` can be compiled as a regex pattern"
   This means it should return True/False, not raise exceptions.

3. The example shows is_re_compilable(1) returning False, demonstrating that non-compilable inputs
   should return False rather than raise exceptions.

4. Most importantly, the official documentation explicitly states the function is for "helping prevent
   runtime errors when working with regular expressions" - this clearly indicates the function's purpose
   is to safely check compilability WITHOUT raising errors.

5. The function's semantic contract is to answer the question "can this be compiled?" with a boolean.
   An invalid regex pattern like ')' cannot be compiled, so the answer should be False, not an exception.

CONCLUSION:
----------
The documentation strongly supports that this is a valid bug. The function is documented as a safe
predicate that returns bool to indicate compilability, not as a function that might raise exceptions.
The entire purpose is to check if something can be compiled WITHOUT causing runtime errors.
