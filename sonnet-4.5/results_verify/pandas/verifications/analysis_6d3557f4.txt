## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The method could be considered internal or experimental since it's not documented in the public API reference. If SparseArray.cumsum() is not officially supported, then calling it might be considered using undocumented functionality.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The method has a proper docstring, is part of the public class interface (not prefixed with underscore), and is clearly intended to work based on its documentation. The infinite recursion is an obvious implementation error, not undefined behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered an edge case if sparse arrays with non-null fill values are rarely used in practice. The workaround (using NaN as fill_value or converting to dense first) might be considered sufficient.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a complete failure of a documented method that causes a program crash with RecursionError. It's not a minor issue or cosmetic problem - the method is completely unusable for a common use case (fill_value=0 is very common for sparse data).

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The method is not listed in the official API documentation, so perhaps the documentation should warn users not to use this method or explain that it only works with null fill values.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code clearly intends to handle non-null fill values (that's why line 1549 checks `if not self._null_fill_value`). This is not a documentation issue but a clear implementation bug where parentheses are misplaced.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that supporting cumsum for sparse arrays with non-null fill values is a new feature that was never properly implemented, and the current code is a placeholder.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The code explicitly attempts to handle this case with dedicated logic at line 1550. The implementation exists but has a typo/logic error. This is not missing functionality but broken functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a clear programming error where `SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()` creates infinite recursion instead of the intended `SparseArray(self.to_dense().cumsum())`. The method crashes with RecursionError for any input when fill_value is not null. The fix is trivial and obvious - moving the parentheses to call cumsum on the dense array before wrapping it.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if the method is not officially supported or if sparse arrays with non-null fill values are considered unsupported, but the code clearly attempts to handle this case.

## Overall Consideration

This is unquestionably a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming:

First, this is a simple typo in the code where parentheses are misplaced, causing `cumsum()` to be called on a newly created SparseArray instead of on the dense numpy array. The infinite recursion is immediate and unconditional - any call to `cumsum()` with a non-null fill_value triggers it. This is not subtle or debatable behavior.

Second, the code explicitly handles the non-null fill_value case with dedicated logic, showing clear intent to support this functionality. The existence of the check `if not self._null_fill_value:` at line 1549 demonstrates that the developers intended to support sparse arrays with non-null fill values. The bug is in the implementation of that support, not in whether it should exist.

Third, the fix is trivial and obvious - changing `SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()` to `SparseArray(self.to_dense().cumsum())` makes the code work exactly as intended. This is clearly what the developer meant to write, as evidenced by the parallel structure with the null fill_value case which correctly computes the cumsum before wrapping. The method cannot possibly work as currently written - it will always recurse infinitely.
