TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating each possible classification:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect):
   AGAINST:
   - The bug is real and reproducible
   - The function does change string length for certain Unicode characters
   - The suffix is not preserved as claimed
   FOR:
   - Python's str.upper() behavior is correct per Unicode standards
   - The function technically does what the code says (upper() on first slice)
   - No documentation exists that specifies length preservation
   VERDICT: Not INVALID - the bug exists as described

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
   FOR:
   - Unicode edge cases with expanding characters are extremely rare
   - Characters like ß, ﬁ, ﬂ are uncommon in most datasets
   - The function is undocumented and possibly internal-only
   - Most users would never encounter this issue
   AGAINST:
   - Data internationalization is important
   - Silent data corruption (changing string length) could cause issues
   - The function name is misleading for these cases
   VERDICT: Possible WONTFIX if deemed too obscure

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported):
   FOR:
   - The function never claimed to handle Unicode edge cases
   - No documentation promises length preservation
   - Could be viewed as a request to add Unicode-aware capitalization
   AGAINST:
   - The current behavior is arguably a bug, not a missing feature
   - The function name implies single-character operation
   VERDICT: Not a FEATURE_REQUEST - this is existing broken behavior

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   FOR:
   - The function has no documentation at all
   - Adding documentation to explain current behavior would clarify expectations
   - The function name is misleading without explanation
   - Users might reasonably expect different behavior based on the name
   AGAINST:
   - There's no existing documentation to fix
   - The code behavior itself is problematic, not just undocumented
   VERDICT: Strong candidate - documentation would help clarify the behavior

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   FOR:
   - Function name strongly implies it should only affect first letter
   - "capitalize_first_letter" suggests single character operation
   - Length change is unexpected and could break downstream code
   - Suffix modification ('eta' -> 'Seta') is clearly wrong
   - Silent data corruption is a serious issue
   AGAINST:
   - No documentation specifies the expected behavior
   - Python's upper() is working correctly per Unicode
   - Function might be internal/undocumented on purpose
   VERDICT: Possible BUG if function name implies contract

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a borderline case between DOCUMENTATION_FIX and BUG. The key factors are:

1. The function is completely undocumented
2. The function name creates strong expectations that are violated
3. The behavior is technically correct Unicode but surprising
4. The suffix modification is particularly problematic

Given that:
- The function has no documentation whatsoever
- The name "capitalize_first_letter" creates reasonable expectations
- The suffix being modified (ßeta -> SSeta where [1:] changes) is clearly wrong
- This could cause silent data corruption

I lean toward BUG because the function name establishes an implicit contract that is violated, especially the suffix modification which cannot be justified even by Unicode standards.
