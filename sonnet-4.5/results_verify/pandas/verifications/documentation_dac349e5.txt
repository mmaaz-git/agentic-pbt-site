## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review
I reviewed the pandas documentation for FixedForwardWindowIndexer from multiple sources:

1. **Online Documentation (pandas.pydata.org)**:
   - States the class "Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
   - Provides examples only with positive window_size values (window_size=2)
   - Does not explicitly state any constraints on window_size values
   - Does not mention behavior for negative window sizes

2. **Built-in Help Documentation**:
   - Class docstring: "Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
   - Examples show only positive window_size (2)
   - No explicit constraints on window_size parameter

3. **Type Annotations**:
   - window_size is typed as 'int' with default value 0
   - No indication that negative values are invalid
   - No NonNegativeInt or similar constraint type used

### Key Observations

1. **No Explicit Constraints**: The documentation does not explicitly state that window_size must be non-negative. The parameter is simply described as "the number of rows in a window" without specifying valid ranges.

2. **Semantic Implications**: While not explicitly stated, the concept of a "window size" and "the number of rows in a window" strongly implies a non-negative value. A window cannot have a negative number of rows - this is semantically nonsensical.

3. **Name and Purpose**: The class name "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" and its purpose to create "fixed-length windows" inherently implies positive window sizes. A "forward-looking window" with negative size is conceptually invalid.

4. **Examples Only Show Valid Cases**: All documentation examples use positive window_size values, suggesting the intended usage pattern.

5. **BaseIndexer Documentation**: The parent class BaseIndexer also doesn't specify constraints on window_size, but its example also uses positive values only.

### Conclusion on Documentation
While the documentation doesn't explicitly forbid negative window_size values, the semantic meaning of "window size" and "number of rows in a window" makes it clear that negative values don't make sense. The lack of explicit validation or documentation about this edge case is a gap that should be addressed either through:
1. Input validation (raising an error for negative values)
2. Documentation clarification about valid ranges
3. Both of the above
