## Documentation Analysis

### Official pandas Documentation

After reviewing the official pandas documentation for `read_csv` and `to_csv`, I found:

1. **No explicit guarantees about CSV round-trip preservation**: The documentation does not promise that DataFrames written to CSV and read back will maintain exact type fidelity, especially for edge cases like integers beyond int64 range.

2. **Limited discussion of large integer handling**: The documentation mentions:
   - Type inference attempts to coerce columns to appropriate types
   - Mixed-type columns default to `object` dtype
   - Users can specify `dtype` parameter explicitly
   - But no specific mention of behavior for integers exceeding int64 range

3. **No documented warnings about type corruption**: The documentation does not warn users that integers beyond int64 range will be converted to strings upon CSV round-trip.

4. **Object dtype behavior**: The documentation mentions object dtype for mixed types but doesn't specify how pure-integer object dtype columns should behave during CSV I/O.

### GitHub Issues and Known Problems

Searching the pandas GitHub repository revealed multiple related issues:

1. **Issue #52505**: "BUG: incorrect reading of CSV containing large integers"
   - Confirms large integers are problematic in CSV parsing
   - Different parsing engines produce inconsistent results
   - Silent data corruption was acknowledged as a critical issue
   - A fix was merged but focused on precision loss within int64 range

2. **Issue #14983, #11440**: uint64 overflow issues
   - Shows long-standing problems with integers at the boundary of int64/uint64
   - Workarounds suggested using python parser or manual conversion

3. **Issue #31821**: Automatic string-to-numeric conversion
   - Shows pandas aggressively tries to convert to numeric types
   - But fails to handle edge cases properly

### Key Finding

The documentation **does not specify** expected behavior for integers beyond int64 range in CSV round-trips. This is a documentation gap, but more importantly, the actual behavior (silent conversion to string) is:

1. **Inconsistent**: The original DataFrame stores it as int (in object dtype), but reading back stores it as string
2. **Unexpected**: No reasonable user would expect numeric data to become string data
3. **Silent**: No warning is given about the type corruption
4. **Data-corrupting**: Arithmetic operations fail, comparisons break

### Conclusion on Documentation

While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise round-trip preservation for large integers, the current behavior violates reasonable expectations:
- If pandas can store a Python int in an object dtype column (which it does when creating the DataFrame), it should restore it as the same type when reading from CSV
- The silent conversion to string is undocumented and unexpected
- This is not merely undefined behavior - it's actively harmful behavior that corrupts data integrity
