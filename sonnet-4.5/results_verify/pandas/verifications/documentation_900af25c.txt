Documentation Review for FixedForwardWindowIndexer
====================================================

After reviewing the pandas documentation for FixedForwardWindowIndexer and its base class BaseIndexer, here are my findings:

1. Window Size Parameter Documentation:
   - The window_size parameter is documented as an integer with default value 0
   - It represents "the size of the moving window" and "the number of observations used for calculating the statistic"
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly state that negative values are prohibited or invalid
   - No validation constraints are documented for the window_size parameter

2. BaseIndexer Class Documentation:
   - BaseIndexer is the parent class that defines the interface
   - The get_window_bounds() method should return two NumPy arrays (start and end) of type np.int64
   - These arrays represent the start and end indices for each window
   - The documentation does not specify any invariants that must hold between start and end arrays

3. FixedForwardWindowIndexer Specific Documentation:
   - Described as creating "window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
   - The class is designed for forward-looking rolling window computations
   - Examples in the documentation only show positive window_size values (e.g., window_size=2)
   - No mention of how the class should behave with negative window_size values

4. Related Error Messages:
   - In pandas.DataFrame.rolling documentation, there are references to "window must be an integer 0 or greater" for the window parameter
   - However, this is for the rolling() method's window parameter, not specifically for FixedForwardWindowIndexer's window_size

5. Semantic Expectations:
   - While not explicitly documented, the semantic meaning of "window size" implies a non-negative value
   - A "size" typically represents a count or measurement that cannot be negative
   - However, this is implicit rather than explicitly stated in the documentation

Conclusion:
The documentation does NOT explicitly prohibit negative window_size values for FixedForwardWindowIndexer. There is no documented validation requirement, no stated invariant that start[i] <= end[i], and no clear specification about how the class should handle negative values. The documentation gap leaves the behavior undefined for negative window_size inputs.
