## Reproduction Report for pandas.io.formats.printing._justify Bug

### Bug Summary
The `_justify` function silently truncates data when input sequences have different lengths, causing data loss without any error or warning.

### Reproduction Steps and Results

1. **Simple Reproduction Case**
   - Input: `head=[['a', 'b', 'c']]`, `tail=[['x']]`
   - Expected: head should retain 3 elements, tail should have 1 element
   - Actual Result: `head=[('a',)]`, `tail=[('x',)]`
   - **Data Loss Confirmed**: 2 elements ('b' and 'c') were silently dropped from head

2. **Edge Case 1**
   - Input: `head=[['', '']]`, `tail=[['']]`
   - Expected: head should have 2 elements
   - Actual Result: `head=[('',)]` - only 1 element
   - **Data Loss Confirmed**: 1 element was dropped

3. **Edge Case 2**
   - Input: `head=[['']]`, `tail=[['', '']]`
   - Expected: tail should have 2 elements
   - Actual Result: `tail=[('',)]` - only 1 element
   - **Data Loss Confirmed**: 1 element was dropped

4. **Property-Based Test**
   - The Hypothesis test failed on both provided examples
   - Error messages confirm length changes:
     - "head[0] length changed: 2 -> 1"
     - "tail[0] length changed: 2 -> 1"
   - The test correctly identifies that the function is not preserving content

### Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs in the implementation at line 484-487 of printing.py:
```python
max_length = [0] * len(combined[0])  # Assumes all sequences have same length as first
for inner_seq in combined:
    length = [len(item) for item in inner_seq]
    max_length = [max(x, y) for x, y in zip(max_length, length)]  # zip truncates!
```

The code incorrectly assumes all sequences have the same length as the first sequence (`combined[0]`). When `zip` is used with sequences of different lengths, it truncates to the shortest, causing data loss.

### Impact
This is a **severe data integrity issue** where user data is silently discarded without any warning or error. The function's behavior violates the principle of least surprise - a "justify" operation should only add padding (spaces), never remove content.
