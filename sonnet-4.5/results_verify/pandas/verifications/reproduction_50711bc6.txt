## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Verification
I successfully reproduced the issue described in the bug report. The test case provided is accurate:

**Test Input:**
- DataFrame with values: [9007199254768175, 1]
- Single group 'a'

**Observed Results:**
- Grouped diff(): -9007199254768176.0
- Ungrouped diff(): -9007199254768174.0
- Difference: 2.0

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs because of how float64 handles integers larger than 2^53:

1. **Integer 9007199254768175 loses precision when converted to float64:**
   - As int64: 9007199254768175
   - As float64: 9007199254768176.0 (rounded up)

2. **Order of operations differs:**
   - **Ungrouped diff()**: Performs subtraction in int64 (1 - 9007199254768175 = -9007199254768174), then converts to float64
   - **Grouped diff()**: Appears to convert to float64 first (9007199254768175 â†’ 9007199254768176.0), then subtracts (1.0 - 9007199254768176.0 = -9007199254768176.0)

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test failed as expected, finding multiple cases where grouped and ungrouped diff() produce different results for large integers > 2^53.

### Additional Findings
1. **Boundary condition**: The issue starts exactly at 2^53 + 1, which is the first integer that cannot be exactly represented in float64
2. **Pattern consistency**: The issue occurs consistently for any integer that loses precision in float64
3. **Multiple groups**: When testing with multiple groups, grouped diff() still exhibits the precision loss pattern while ungrouped diff() does not

### Technical Details
- 2^53 = 9007199254740992 is the largest integer that can be exactly represented in float64
- Any integer larger than 2^53 may lose precision when converted to float64
- The grouped implementation appears to convert data to float64 before computing differences
- The ungrouped implementation appears to compute differences in the original dtype before converting to float64

The bug report is technically accurate in its description of the behavior and the root cause.
