## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in `pandas.core.indexers.objects.FixedWindowIndexer.get_window_bounds`.

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The provided Hypothesis test correctly identifies the bug. When run with the failing input:
- `num_values=2, window_size=0, center=False, closed='neither', step=None`

The test fails with:
```
AssertionError: start <= end should hold for all windows. Got start=[0 1], end=[0 0]
```

### Manual Reproduction
The manual reproduction code provided in the bug report is accurate and produces the exact output claimed:
```
start: [0 1]
end: [0 0]
start[1] > end[1]: 1 > 0
```

### Extended Testing
I performed comprehensive testing across multiple scenarios:

1. **Confirmed invariant violation**: `FixedWindowIndexer(window_size=0)` with `closed='neither'` consistently produces `start > end` for indices beyond the first.

2. **Pattern identified**: The violation specifically occurs when:
   - `window_size=0`
   - `closed='neither'`
   - For any `num_values > 1`

3. **Other closed parameters work correctly**:
   - `closed='both'`: No violation (start <= end)
   - `closed='left'`: No violation (start <= end)
   - `closed='right'`: No violation (start <= end)
   - `closed=None`: No violation (start <= end)

4. **Practical impact**: When used in actual rolling operations, the violated bounds produce empty windows (as expected when start > end in Python slicing), resulting in all zeros for aggregation operations like sum.

### Root Cause Verification
The bug is in the offset calculation at line 106 of the source code:
```python
if center or self.window_size == 0:
    offset = (self.window_size - 1) // 2  # When window_size=0, this becomes -1
```

When `window_size=0`, the offset becomes `(0-1)//2 = -1`. This negative offset then affects the subsequent calculations, particularly when combined with `closed='neither'` which further decrements the end array.

The bug is real, reproducible, and the analysis in the bug report is accurate.
