# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation
The `length_of_indexer` function has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Return type: int
- No detailed description of behavior or edge cases
- No examples provided

## Key Findings

### 1. Function Purpose
The documentation clearly states that the function should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]". This is an unambiguous statement that the function should return what len(target[indexer]) would return.

### 2. Python Slice Behavior
Python's built-in slice behavior is well-defined:
- Slices always produce sequences with non-negative lengths
- An empty slice (where no elements match) has length 0, never negative
- This is fundamental Python behavior that any Python developer would expect

### 3. Usage Context
The function is used internally in pandas for:
- Validating setitem operations (check_setitem_lengths function)
- Pre-allocating arrays
- Checking if operations would be no-ops

In all these contexts, a negative length makes no sense and would be incorrect.

### 4. Test Coverage
The existing test in test_indexers.py only tests boolean array indexing, not slice indexing. There are no tests for slice behavior, which allowed this bug to go undetected.

### 5. Documentation Verdict
While the documentation is minimal, it is clear and unambiguous: the function should return "the expected length of target[indexer]". Since Python slices never have negative lengths, returning negative values clearly violates the documented behavior. The function is not behaving as documented.

The bug is a clear violation of both the documented behavior and expected Python semantics.
