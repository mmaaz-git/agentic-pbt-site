## Documentation Findings for pandas.util.version InfinityType and NegativeInfinityType

### Source Code Location
The classes are found in pandas/util/version/__init__.py. The file header indicates this code was vendored from the PyPA packaging library (https://github.com/pypa/packaging/) as of commit ae891fd74d6dd4c6063bb04f2faeadaac6fc6313 from 04/30/2021.

### Purpose and Context
These classes are part of pandas' internal version comparison system. They're used as sentinel values in version comparisons, particularly for handling edge cases in PEP 440 compliant version sorting.

### Documentation Status
1. **No explicit documentation**: Neither class has a docstring explaining their intended behavior or comparison semantics.

2. **Vendored code**: The code is vendored from the PyPA packaging library, suggesting pandas follows the upstream implementation's behavior.

3. **Private module**: The pandas.util module is considered PRIVATE according to pandas documentation, indicating these are internal implementation details not meant for public use.

### Intended Use Cases
Based on the code context, these infinity types are used in version comparison keys (_cmpkey function):
- Infinity is used when certain version segments are missing (e.g., pre-release versions)
- NegativeInfinity is used for other missing segments (e.g., post-release segments)
- They help establish correct sorting order for different version types

### Comparison Behavior in Original Packaging Library
I checked the original packaging library implementation, and it shows the same comparison implementation - the classes are NOT designed to be reflexive. This appears to be the intended behavior from the upstream library.

### Key Finding
The documentation does not specify whether these classes should follow normal comparison reflexivity properties. The classes are internal utilities for version comparison, not general-purpose infinity representations. The behavior matches the upstream packaging library from which this code was vendored.
