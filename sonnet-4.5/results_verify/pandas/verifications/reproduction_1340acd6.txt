## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### 1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction
- The provided Hypothesis test case fails when run with the specific input `values=[0.0, 2.2250738585e-313], bins=2`
- The test expects all values to be binned (non-NA), but pd.cut returns all NaN values
- Runtime warnings about "invalid value encountered in divide" are raised, indicating numerical precision issues

### 2. Minimal Reproduction Case
- Confirmed that `pd.cut(pd.Series([0.0, 2.225e-313]), bins=2)` returns `[nan, nan]`
- The function silently returns NaN values instead of successfully binning the data or raising a clear error

### 3. Negative Subnormal Values
- Confirmed that `pd.cut(pd.Series([0.0, -2.225e-313]), bins=2)` raises a ValueError
- The error message "missing values must be missing in the same location both left and right sides" is confusing and not directly related to the input issue

### 4. Boundary Testing
Through additional testing, I found:
- Values with range >= 1e-300 work correctly and produce proper bins
- Values with range around 1e-305 raise ValueError
- Values with range <= 1e-308 (including subnormal floats) return all NaN values
- The issue appears when the range between min and max values is extremely small (< ~1e-300)

### 5. Impact
The bug is real and has two problematic behaviors:
1. **Silent failure**: Returns all NaN values without warning when the data range is in the subnormal float region
2. **Confusing errors**: Raises unclear ValueError messages for certain edge cases

This could lead to:
- Silent data loss in analysis pipelines
- Difficult-to-debug issues when working with very small measurements
- Misleading results in scientific computing applications

The bug report accurately describes the issue and provides valid reproduction cases.
