## Documentation Findings for pandas.io.json read_json and to_json

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Round-trip Compatibility:**
   - The read_json documentation states that it is "Designed to be compatible with `to_json()` across different orient formats"
   - However, the documentation does NOT provide explicit guarantees about perfect round-trip compatibility
   - The documentation notes: "Any orient option that encodes to a JSON object will not preserve the ordering of index and column labels during round-trip serialization"
   - No explicit promise is made about preserving index dtypes during round-trips

2. **Orient='split' Behavior:**
   - Creates/expects a dictionary with keys: 'index', 'columns', and 'data'
   - The documentation states that 'split' "uses ordered containers" for preserving label ordering
   - No specific details about dtype preservation for empty indices

3. **Index Type Preservation:**
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly discuss preservation of index types (integer vs float)
   - There is no documented guarantee that index dtypes will be preserved during JSON serialization/deserialization
   - The documentation mentions a known limitation with index names but not index dtypes

4. **Empty DataFrame Handling:**
   - The documentation provides no specific information about how empty DataFrames are handled
   - No special cases or warnings are mentioned for empty DataFrames in JSON operations

5. **Implicit vs Explicit Guarantees:**
   - While the bug report claims "Compatible JSON strings can be produced by to_json() with a corresponding orient value" implies round-trip compatibility, this is actually about FORMAT compatibility, not perfect data type preservation
   - The documentation focuses on structural compatibility (ability to read what was written) rather than perfect type preservation

### Conclusion from Documentation

The documentation does NOT explicitly guarantee that index dtypes will be preserved during JSON round-trips. The phrase about "compatible JSON strings" refers to the ability to read JSON produced by to_json(), not a guarantee of perfect round-trip fidelity including all data types. This is particularly relevant for edge cases like empty DataFrames where type inference becomes ambiguous.
