## Documentation Analysis for pandas.api.interchange

After reviewing the pandas documentation and the official DataFrame interchange protocol specification, here are the key findings:

### pandas.api.interchange Documentation

1. **Function Purpose**: `pandas.api.interchange.from_dataframe()` builds a pandas DataFrame from any DataFrame supporting the interchange protocol.

2. **Current Status**: The documentation explicitly warns about "severe implementation issues" and recommends using the Arrow C Data Interface instead for new development.

3. **String Encoding Specification**: The official DataFrame interchange protocol (https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/API.html) specifies that the STRING dtype (kind 21) is "UTF-8 encoded" according to the DtypeKind enum definition.

4. **No Explicit Surrogate Handling**: Neither the pandas documentation nor the official protocol specification explicitly addresses how to handle surrogate characters (U+D800 to U+DFFF), which are invalid in UTF-8 encoding by definition.

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation does not specify what should happen when string data contains characters that cannot be encoded to UTF-8.

2. There is no mention of error handling strategies for encoding failures.

3. The protocol specification simply states strings are "UTF-8" without clarifying edge cases like surrogates, which are fundamentally incompatible with UTF-8.

### Implementation Reality

The code at `/pandas/core/interchange/column.py:351` performs a direct UTF-8 encoding without any error handling:
```python
b.extend(obj.encode(encoding="utf-8"))
```

This will raise a UnicodeEncodeError when encountering surrogate characters, as UTF-8 cannot represent unpaired surrogates by specification.
