BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed.

TEST RESULTS:
1. Python's encoding system accepts multiple valid UTF-8 encoding names:
   - "utf-8", "UTF-8", "utf_8", "UTF_8", "Utf-8", "utf8", "UTF8" all work with Python's encode()

2. Pandas clipboard functions REJECT some valid UTF-8 encoding names:
   - "utf_8" and "UTF_8" are rejected by both read_clipboard() and to_clipboard()
   - Error messages:
     - read_clipboard: "reading from clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding"
     - to_clipboard: "clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding"

3. The Hypothesis test fails as expected:
   - Failure on encoding "utf_8" with AssertionError confirming the rejection

ROOT CAUSE:
The validation logic at lines 78-79 (read_clipboard) and 160-161 (to_clipboard) uses:
   encoding.lower().replace("-", "") != "utf8"

This only removes hyphens but not underscores, so:
- "utf-8" → "utf8" ✓ (passes)
- "utf_8" → "utf_8" ✗ (fails, doesn't equal "utf8")

The bug is real and the report accurately describes both the problem and its cause.
