## Documentation Analysis for read_clipboard()

### Official Documentation
The official pandas documentation for `read_clipboard()` states:
- Default separator is `'\s+'` (one or more whitespace characters)
- The function passes clipboard contents to `read_csv()` internally
- The function is designed to handle tabular data from various sources including Excel

### Code Comments and Intended Behavior
The source code comments in `clipboards.py` (lines 94-97) explicitly document the intended behavior:
```
# Excel copies into clipboard with \t separation
# inspect no more then the 10 first lines, if they
# all contain an equal number (>0) of tabs, infer
# that this came from excel and set 'sep' accordingly
```

This comment establishes clear intent:
1. Excel data should be automatically detected based on tab consistency
2. The function should inspect up to 10 lines to make this determination
3. If all lines contain the same number of tabs (>0), it should switch from the default separator to tab separator

### No Documented Assumptions about Trailing Newlines
Neither the official documentation nor the code comments specify any requirement or assumption that clipboard text must end with a trailing newline. There is no documentation suggesting that:
- Clipboard text format must conform to any specific line ending convention
- The last line should or shouldn't have a newline
- Different clipboard sources might have different line ending behaviors

### Expectation vs Implementation Mismatch
The code's documented intent is to detect Excel data by examining "the 10 first lines." However, the implementation unconditionally discards the last line regardless of whether it's empty or contains actual data. This creates a mismatch where:
- A 2-line Excel clipboard content without trailing newline appears as 1 line
- This fails the `len(lines) > 1` check, preventing tab detection
- Excel data is not recognized as intended

### Conclusion
The bug violates the documented behavior. The comments clearly state that Excel data with tab separation should be detected, but the current implementation fails to do so for valid clipboard content that lacks a trailing newline. There is no documentation requiring trailing newlines in clipboard data.
