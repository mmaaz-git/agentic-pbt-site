## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Setup
The bug report claims that `waitForPaste` and `waitForNewPaste` raise `PyperclipException` immediately when the clipboard is unavailable, instead of waiting for the timeout and raising `PyperclipTimeoutException`.

### Reproduction Tests

**Test 1: Hypothesis test with timeout=0.0625**
- Expected: Should wait 0.0625 seconds then raise `PyperclipTimeoutException`
- Actual: Immediately raised `PyperclipException` with message about clipboard not being available
- Time elapsed: ~0.000 seconds (immediate)

**Test 2: Longer timeout (1.0 second)**
- Expected: Should wait 1.0 second then raise `PyperclipTimeoutException`
- Actual: Immediately raised `PyperclipException` with message about clipboard not being available
- Time elapsed: ~0.000 seconds (immediate)

**Test 3: waitForNewPaste with timeout=0.1**
- Expected: Should wait 0.1 seconds then raise `PyperclipTimeoutException`
- Actual: Immediately raised `PyperclipException` with message about clipboard not being available
- Time elapsed: ~0.000 seconds (immediate)

**Test 4: Direct paste() call**
- This confirmed that `paste()` itself raises `PyperclipException` when clipboard is unavailable
- This is the root cause of the issue

### Technical Analysis

The bug is CONFIRMED. Here's what happens:

1. When `set_clipboard('no')` is called, it sets up a `ClipboardUnavailable` object that raises `PyperclipException` whenever called.

2. In `waitForPaste` (line 703), the code calls `clipboardText = paste()` without any exception handling.

3. In `waitForNewPaste` (lines 723 and 725), the code calls `paste()` twice without exception handling.

4. The `PyperclipException` from `paste()` propagates up immediately, bypassing all timeout logic.

5. The timeout checking code (lines 708-711 and 730-733) is never reached because the exception occurs first.

### Bug Validity

The bug report is technically correct:
- The functions DO raise the wrong exception type (`PyperclipException` instead of `PyperclipTimeoutException`)
- The functions DO NOT wait for the specified timeout
- The behavior violates the documented contract that specifically promises `PyperclipTimeoutException` for timeout scenarios

### Proposed Fix Analysis

The bug report's proposed fix is to catch `PyperclipException` and treat it as an empty clipboard. This would:
1. Allow the timeout logic to execute properly
2. Eventually raise the correct `PyperclipTimeoutException` after the timeout
3. Make the behavior consistent with the documentation

This approach makes sense because an unavailable clipboard could be considered equivalent to an empty clipboard for the purpose of waiting for content.
