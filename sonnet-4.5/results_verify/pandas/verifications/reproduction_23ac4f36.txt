BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

Test Environment:
- pandas version: (tested with current version)
- Python: python3

1. Basic Reproduction - CONFIRMED:
   Input: pd.Series([31536001.0])
   Original dtype: float64
   After round-trip dtype: datetime64[ns]
   Original value: 31536001.0
   After round-trip value: 1971-01-01 00:00:01

   VERDICT: Bug report is technically correct - the dtype and value change

2. Threshold Testing - CONFIRMED:
   - Value 31535999.0: float64 -> int64 (no date conversion)
   - Value 31536000.0: float64 -> int64 (no date conversion, exactly at threshold)
   - Value 31536001.0: float64 -> datetime64[ns] (converts to date)
   - Value 31536000.5: float64 -> datetime64[ns] (converts to date)

   VERDICT: There is indeed a threshold at 31536000 (seconds in a year)

3. Additional Test Cases - CONFIRMED:
   - Value 1000000000.5 becomes 2001-09-09 01:46:40.500000
   - Value 86400000.0 becomes 1972-09-27 00:00:00

   VERDICT: Large numeric values are being interpreted as timestamps

4. Workaround Testing - CONFIRMED:
   Using convert_dates=False prevents the conversion:
   - Original: 31536001.0 (float64)
   - After round-trip with convert_dates=False: 31536001 (int64)

   Note: dtype still changes from float64 to int64, but at least doesn't become datetime

5. Hypothesis Test - FAILED AS EXPECTED:
   The property-based test fails with the assertion error about dtype change.
   This confirms the round-trip property is violated.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
- The value 31536000 represents exactly 365 days in seconds (365 * 24 * 60 * 60)
- pandas appears to interpret any numeric value > 31536000 as a Unix timestamp
- This is happening in the automatic date conversion logic when convert_dates=True (default)

KEY OBSERVATION:
The bug report is technically accurate. pandas is indeed automatically converting numeric values to dates based on magnitude, which:
1. Changes the dtype from float64 to datetime64[ns]
2. Changes the interpretation of the value
3. Violates round-trip serialization expectations
4. Is NOT documented in the official documentation
