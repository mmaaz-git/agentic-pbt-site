## Bug Reproduction

I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test failed as expected with the assertion error:
```
AssertionError: NaTType() should return pd.NaT singleton, got different object
```
This confirms that calling `NaTType()` does not return the `pd.NaT` singleton.

### Manual Test Results
Running the manual reproduction code confirmed all the issues stated in the bug report:

1. **Identity check fails**: `nat_from_call is pd.NaT` returns `False`
2. **pd.isna() fails**: `pd.isna(nat_from_call)` returns `False`
3. **Series.isna() fails**: Only recognizes the real `pd.NaT` as missing, not the NaTType() instance
4. **Multiple instances are different**: Each call to `NaTType()` creates a new object
5. **Instances are not equal**: Two NaTType() instances are not equal to each other

### Additional Testing Reveals
- `pd.NaT` is correctly implemented as a singleton (multiple references are identical)
- `NaTType()` creates new instances each time it's called (violating singleton pattern)
- `NAType()` correctly returns the `pd.NA` singleton (showing inconsistent behavior)
- The types are the same (`pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype.NaTType`) but the instances are different

### Impact
The bug causes incorrect behavior in pandas operations:
- Missing value detection fails for NaTType() instances
- Identity checks fail when they should succeed
- Series operations don't recognize these instances as missing values

This is a valid bug that breaks expected pandas functionality.
