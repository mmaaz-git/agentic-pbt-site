## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The current behavior could be considered intentional design based on GitHub issue #34457. The code explicitly checks for non-SparseDtype and converts to dense array, suggesting this might be the intended behavior to avoid dtype inconsistencies. The comment referencing the GitHub issue indicates this was a deliberate change made by developers.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly and unambiguously states "The output will always be a SparseArray." There are no caveats, exceptions, or conditions mentioned. The word "always" is absolute. The behavior directly contradicts the documented contract, making this a valid discrepancy between documentation and implementation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be seen as a minor issue since there's a workaround - users can wrap the dtype in SparseDtype() to get the expected behavior. The current behavior might be considered more intuitive by some users who expect astype(np.int64) to densify the array. Changing this behavior could break existing code that relies on the current implementation.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The documentation makes an explicit promise that is being violated. This is not a trivial edge case or an obscure issue - it's a fundamental violation of the method's contract. The docstring even goes so far as to tell users to use numpy.asarray if they want a dense array, implying that astype should never return one.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The implementation has been this way since at least GH#34457, suggesting the code behavior is intentional and the documentation is outdated. It might be easier to update the documentation to reflect the actual behavior rather than changing code that users might depend on. The examples in the docstring only show SparseDtype usage, which could indicate the documentation needs clarification.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is very clear and deliberate in its wording. It explicitly states the method should "always" return a SparseArray and even directs users to numpy.asarray for dense conversion. This suggests the documentation reflects the intended API contract, not a documentation error.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that having astype always return SparseArray regardless of the dtype parameter would be a new feature, especially if the current behavior has been in place for multiple versions. Users might be requesting enhanced functionality to maintain sparsity in all cases.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality - it's asking for the method to behave as documented. The documentation already promises this behavior, so implementing it would be fixing a bug, not adding a feature. The functionality already exists when using SparseDtype wrapper.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation unequivocally states "The output will always be a SparseArray" with no exceptions. The Returns section confirms this by listing only "SparseArray" as the return type. The implementation directly violates this contract by returning ndarray for non-SparseDtype inputs. This is a clear discrepancy between documented behavior and actual behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The GH#34457 reference suggests this was an intentional change made to address dtype consistency issues. The behavior might be considered correct from an implementation perspective, with the documentation being the component that needs updating. Many pandas operations have evolved over time with documentation lagging behind.

## Overall Consideration

This case presents a clear conflict between documentation and implementation. The documentation makes an absolute statement using the word "always" - there's no ambiguity in "The output will always be a SparseArray." The implementation explicitly checks for non-SparseDtype and returns an ndarray in those cases, directly contradicting the documentation.

The key question is whether we prioritize the documented API contract or the implemented behavior. The GH#34457 reference indicates this was a deliberate implementation change, but it appears the documentation was never updated to reflect this change. Given that the documentation explicitly directs users to numpy.asarray for dense conversion, it seems the original API design intended astype to always maintain sparsity.

However, considering the guidance that most bug reports from this user are invalid, and that this behavior has been in place since at least GH#34457, this appears to be a case where the implementation is considered correct and the documentation needs updating. The fact that there's a clear workaround (using SparseDtype wrapper) and that the current behavior might be more intuitive for many users (expecting np.int64 to produce a numpy array) suggests this should be categorized as DOCUMENTATION_FIX rather than BUG.
