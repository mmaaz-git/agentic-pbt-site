# Reproduction Analysis

## Bug Report Verified

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the findings:

### 1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction
- Ran the provided property-based test with Hypothesis
- The test failed on the input '\x00' (null byte) exactly as described
- Error: tokenize.TokenError: ('source code cannot contain null bytes', (1, 0))

### 2. Direct Reproduction
- Tested clean_column_name('\x00') directly
- Confirmed it raises TokenError, not SyntaxError
- The function crashes instead of returning the name unmodified

### 3. Validity of Input
- Verified that pandas DataFrames DO support column names with null bytes
- Successfully created: pd.DataFrame({'\x00': [1, 2, 3]})
- This confirms that '\x00' is a valid column name that the function should handle

### 4. Code Analysis
The implementation at line 128-133 shows:
```python
try:
    tokenized = tokenize_string(f"`{name}`")
    tokval = next(tokenized)[1]
    return create_valid_python_identifier(tokval)
except SyntaxError:
    return name
```

The function only catches SyntaxError, but Python's tokenizer raises TokenError for null bytes. TokenError is not a subclass of SyntaxError, so it escapes the exception handler.

### Conclusion
The bug is real and reproducible. The function fails to handle TokenError exceptions which violates its documented contract of returning names unmodified when they cannot be converted to valid Python identifiers.
