BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. TEST EXECUTION:
I successfully ran the bug report's reproduction code and confirmed the issue:

Original DataFrame with categorical column containing ["cat1", None]:
- Original values: ['cat1', nan]
- After round-trip: ['cat1', 'cat1']

The null value at position 1 was incorrectly converted to 'cat1'.

2. MULTIPLE TEST CASES:
Tested various scenarios with null values in categorical columns:
- ['cat1', None] → ['cat1', 'cat1'] (null becomes first category)
- ['cat1', 'cat2', None] → ['cat1', 'cat2', 'cat2'] (null becomes last category)
- [None, 'cat1'] → ['cat1', 'cat1'] (null becomes existing category)
- ['cat1', None, 'cat2', None] → ['cat1', 'cat2', 'cat2', 'cat2']

In ALL cases, null values were lost and replaced with category values.

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The bug occurs in categorical_column_to_series() at lines 253-254:

```python
if len(categories) > 0:
    values = categories[codes % len(categories)]
```

When a null is represented by sentinel value -1:
- -1 % 2 = 1 (for 2 categories)
- -1 % 3 = 2 (for 3 categories)
- This maps the sentinel to the last valid category index

4. INTERNAL DATA FLOW:
Traced the data flow:
a) Original categorical: codes = [0, -1, 1], categories = ['cat1', 'cat2']
b) Interchange representation: USE_SENTINEL with sentinel_val = -1
c) After modulo: codes % 2 = [0, 1, 1]
d) Result: ['cat1', 'cat2', 'cat2'] instead of ['cat1', None, 'cat2']

5. VERIFICATION OF BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
✓ The bug exists as described
✓ Null values are incorrectly converted to category values
✓ The root cause is the modulo operation on sentinel values
✓ The issue affects all categorical columns with nulls using sentinel representation

6. IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- Data loss: NULL values are silently converted to valid categories
- Silent failure: No error or warning is raised
- Affects all round-trip operations through the interchange protocol
- The function set_nulls() is called AFTER the incorrect conversion, but by then the sentinel values have already been incorrectly mapped to categories

CONCLUSION:
The bug is 100% reproducible and behaves exactly as described in the bug report. The technical analysis in the report correctly identifies the problematic code section and the mechanism of failure.
