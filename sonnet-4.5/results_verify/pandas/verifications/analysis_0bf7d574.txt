BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

## Considering Each Possible Classification

### 1. BUG
**Arguments For:**
- There is a genuine inconsistency between split() and rsplit() APIs
- Users reasonably expect symmetry between these paired methods
- The bug report correctly identifies a missing parameter in rsplit()

**Arguments Against:**
- The code works as documented
- There's no promise of API parity between split() and rsplit()
- rsplit() currently works correctly for its documented use cases
- The missing parameter doesn't prevent rsplit() from functioning

### 2. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Adding regex parameter to rsplit() would be a new capability, not fixing broken functionality
- The current rsplit() works correctly according to its documentation
- The request is for enhancing rsplit() to match split()'s capabilities
- This is about adding functionality that was never promised or documented
- The documentation never stated that rsplit() should support regex patterns
- This would be an API enhancement for consistency, not a bug fix

**Arguments Against:**
- The report frames this as a bug due to API inconsistency
- Users expect parity between complementary methods

### 3. INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The code behaves exactly as documented
- There's no specification requiring API parity between split() and rsplit()
- The methods work correctly for their intended purposes

**Arguments Against:**
- There is a real inconsistency that affects user experience
- The expectation of API symmetry is reasonable for paired methods
- The issue is reproducible and accurately described

### 4. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- The inconsistency might be considered trivial since rsplit() works fine without regex
- Users can work around this by using split() with reversed strings if needed

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a clear API inconsistency
- The fix would improve user experience and API consistency
- The inconsistency affects real use cases

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue the documentation should explicitly note the API difference

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation accurately describes both methods
- Each method's documentation correctly lists its parameters
- There's no documentation error to fix

## Analysis Summary

The key question is whether API inconsistency between related methods constitutes a bug or a feature request.

Facts:
1. The methods split() and rsplit() are clearly paired/complementary methods
2. split() has evolved to include regex support via the regex parameter
3. rsplit() has not received the same enhancement
4. Both methods work correctly according to their documentation
5. The documentation never promises API parity

The report identifies a genuine inconsistency, but this inconsistency is between two correctly functioning, properly documented methods. The request is to enhance rsplit() to match split()'s capabilities - this is adding new functionality, not fixing broken behavior.

## Recommendation

This should be classified as **FEATURE_REQUEST**. While the API inconsistency is real and the request is reasonable, adding a regex parameter to rsplit() would be implementing new functionality that was never promised, documented, or previously available. The current implementation works correctly according to its specification.
