DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. PANDAS LISTACCESSOR DOCUMENTATION:
   - Source code location: pandas/core/arrays/arrow/accessors.py, lines 117-177
   - The __getitem__ method docstring (lines 118-147) states:
     * "Index or slice lists in the Series"
     * Parameters: "key : int | slice - Index or slice of indices to access from each list"
     * Returns: "pandas.Series - The list at requested index"
   - NO MENTION of restrictions on slice values
   - NO MENTION that start cannot equal stop
   - NO MENTION of any limitations inherited from PyArrow
   - The docstring only provides an example of integer indexing, not slicing

2. PYARROW LIST_SLICE DOCUMENTATION:
   - PyArrow's pc.list_slice function documentation states:
     * "Compute slice of list-like array"
     * Parameters include start (inclusive), stop (exclusive), and step
     * NO EXPLICIT MENTION that start must be less than stop
   - However, the actual implementation enforces start < stop, throwing an error otherwise

3. PYTHON SLICE SEMANTICS:
   - Python's standard slicing behavior is well-documented:
     * slice[start:stop] returns elements from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive)
     * When start == stop, an empty sequence is returned
     * This is standard behavior across all Python sequence types
   - Python documentation reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range

4. PANDAS CONSISTENCY EXPECTATIONS:
   - Pandas generally follows Python semantics for operations
   - Regular Series slicing (s[n:n]) returns an empty Series, as expected
   - Users would reasonably expect list accessor slicing to follow the same pattern

5. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
   - The ListAccessor.__getitem__ documentation does not specify:
     * What happens with empty slices (start == stop)
     * That it delegates to PyArrow's list_slice with its limitations
     * Any deviations from standard Python slice semantics
   - This is a documentation omission that leads to unexpected behavior

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not indicate that empty slices should fail. The natural expectation from both Python semantics and pandas' own Series slicing behavior is that s.list[n:n] should return a Series of empty lists. The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise and is not documented as a limitation.
