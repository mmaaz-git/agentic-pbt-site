## Documentation Analysis for slice_replace

### Official pandas Documentation
The pandas documentation for `slice_replace` states:
- **Purpose**: "Replace a positional slice of a string with another value"
- **Parameters**:
  - `start`: Left index position for slice (optional)
  - `stop`: Right index position for slice (optional)
  - `repl`: Replacement string (optional, defaults to empty string)

### Key Documentation Points
1. The documentation describes this as replacing a "positional slice" - this implies standard Python slicing semantics
2. The documentation does NOT specify any special behavior when start > stop
3. The examples provided only show cases where start <= stop
4. The documentation does NOT state that the behavior deviates from Python's slicing in any way

### What the Documentation Implies
Since the method is described as replacing a "positional slice", users would reasonably expect it to follow Python's standard slicing behavior, where:
- A slice `[start:stop]` extracts characters from index `start` up to but not including index `stop`
- When `start >= stop`, the slice is empty
- The operation `string[:start] + repl + string[stop:]` is well-defined for all valid start/stop values

### Python's Slicing Semantics
Python's official slicing behavior is well-established:
- When start > stop, the slice returns an empty sequence
- This is not an error condition; it's standard, documented behavior
- The expression `s[:start] + repl + s[stop:]` is valid even when start > stop

### Documentation Gap
The pandas documentation does not explicitly state how slice_replace should behave when start > stop. However:
1. Since it describes replacing a "positional slice", it implies Python slicing semantics
2. No warning or note indicates deviation from standard Python behavior
3. Users would reasonably expect consistency with Python's slicing

### Conclusion
The documentation, while not explicitly covering the start > stop case, implies that slice_replace should follow Python's standard slicing semantics. The current implementation's behavior when start > stop is neither documented nor consistent with what users would expect from a method that claims to replace a "positional slice".
