DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Official Documentation Review

### pandas.Series.str.slice_replace Documentation
From the official pandas documentation and docstring:

1. **Purpose**: "Replace a positional slice of a string with another value"

2. **Parameters**:
   - start: "Left index position to use for the slice"
   - stop: "Right index position to use for the slice"
   - repl: "String for replacement"

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   The documentation states that the method replaces the slice from `start` to `stop` with `repl`.
   The examples show:
   - s.str.slice_replace(start=1, stop=3, repl='X') replaces the slice [1:3] with 'X'
   - Everything before `start` and after `stop` is included as is

4. **Critical Finding**:
   The documentation does NOT specify what should happen when start > stop. However, it uses the term "slice" which has a well-defined meaning in Python.

## Python Slicing Semantics
Python's slicing behavior is well-established:
- When start > stop, the slice is empty: text[start:stop] = ''
- The operation text[:start] + repl + text[stop:] is mathematically well-defined even when start > stop

## Expected Behavior Analysis
Given that:
1. The method is called "slice_replace" explicitly referencing Python's slice concept
2. The documentation describes replacing a "positional slice"
3. Python has clear, consistent semantics for slices where start > stop

The reasonable expectation is that pandas should follow Python's slicing semantics:
- text[:start] + repl + text[stop:] should work correctly for ALL valid integer values of start and stop
- This includes cases where start > stop

## Documentation Gap
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state the behavior for start > stop, the use of "slice" terminology and the method's design strongly implies it should follow Python's standard slicing semantics. The current implementation violates this implicit contract.
