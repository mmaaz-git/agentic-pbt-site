## Documentation Analysis for format_percentiles

### Function Documentation (Docstring)
The function's docstring is found directly in the source code at lines 1549-1579 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py`:

```python
"""
Outputs rounded and formatted percentiles.

Parameters
----------
percentiles : list-like, containing floats from interval [0,1]

Returns
-------
formatted : list of strings

Notes
-----
Rounding precision is chosen so that: (1) if any two elements of
``percentiles`` differ, they remain different after rounding
(2) no entry is *rounded* to 0% or 100%.
Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place.

Examples
--------
Keeps all entries different after rounding:

>>> format_percentiles([0.01999, 0.02001, 0.5, 0.666666, 0.9999])
['1.999%', '2.001%', '50%', '66.667%', '99.99%']

No element is rounded to 0% or 100% (unless already equal to it).
Duplicates are allowed:

>>> format_percentiles([0, 0.5, 0.02001, 0.5, 0.666666, 0.9999])
['0%', '50%', '2.0%', '50%', '66.67%', '99.99%']
"""
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Explicit Guarantee**: The documentation explicitly states in the Notes section that "Rounding precision is chosen so that: (1) if any two elements of ``percentiles`` differ, they remain different after rounding"

2. **Duplicate Handling**: The documentation shows that duplicates ARE allowed in the input (see the second example), but it doesn't say that unique inputs can become duplicates in the output.

3. **Function Type**: This is an internal utility function (not part of the public pandas API), used by the `describe()` method to format percentile labels.

### External Documentation
- Web search revealed this is NOT a public API function
- No external pandas documentation exists for this function
- The function is used internally by `pandas.core.methods.describe.py` for formatting percentile labels in the `describe()` output

### Test Coverage
The existing test suite (`test_format_percentiles` in test_format.py) tests various cases but does NOT test extremely small values near zero that could violate the uniqueness guarantee.

### Conclusion
The documentation is clear and unambiguous: the function MUST preserve the uniqueness of different input values in the output. The current implementation violates this documented guarantee.
