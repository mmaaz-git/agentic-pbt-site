=== BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS ===

Evaluating this bug report against the five possible categories:

## 1. INVALID (Code is correct, report is wrong)
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The Table Schema spec only defines generic "integer" type
- pandas is following the external specification correctly

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The bug causes actual data corruption (9223372036854775808 becomes -9223372036854775808)
- Other orient modes handle uint64 correctly, showing pandas CAN preserve these values
- Silent data corruption is objectively incorrect behavior
**Verdict: NOT INVALID**

## 2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- uint64 values > 2^63-1 might be considered edge cases
- The Table Schema specification limitation is external to pandas

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Silent data corruption is never trivial
- uint64 is a standard pandas dtype, not an obscure edge case
- Financial, scientific, and cryptographic applications commonly use large unsigned integers
- The corruption changes sign, making errors catastrophic rather than minor
**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX**

## 3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting uint64 in table schema might require extending the Table Schema spec
- Could be seen as requesting new functionality beyond current spec

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Round-trip data integrity is an existing, documented feature expectation
- Other orient modes already support this - it's not new functionality
- Users aren't asking for new features, just data preservation
**Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST**

## 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong about code behavior)
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Documentation implies round-trip compatibility without mentioning this limitation
- Could document the limitation and keep the current behavior

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior (silent data corruption) is fundamentally wrong
- Documenting data corruption doesn't make it acceptable
- The issue is the implementation, not the documentation
**Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX**

## 5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
**Why it IS a BUG:**
- **Silent data corruption**: Values change from positive to negative without warning
- **Violates reasonable expectations**: Round-trip should preserve data
- **Inconsistent behavior**: Other orient modes work correctly
- **Documentation implies safety**: 'table' described as most comprehensive format
- **Data integrity violation**: Fundamental requirement for data processing library
- **Fixable issue**: Could extend schema or handle uint64 values properly

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- (No compelling reasons found)

**Verdict: IS A BUG**

## Final Assessment:

This is clearly a **BUG**. Silent data corruption in a data processing library is a serious issue that violates fundamental expectations of data integrity. The fact that:
1. The value changes sign (positive to negative)
2. No error or warning is raised
3. Other orient modes handle this correctly
4. The documentation suggests round-trip compatibility

Makes this a high-priority bug that should be fixed, not worked around or documented away.
