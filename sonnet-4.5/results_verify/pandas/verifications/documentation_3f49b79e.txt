# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation

The `import_optional_dependency` function in `pandas/compat/_optional.py` has clear documentation in the docstring (lines 91-124):

### Purpose
"Import an optional dependency. By default, if a dependency is missing an ImportError with a nice message will be raised. If a dependency is present, but too old, we raise."

### Parameters
- `name`: The module name (no restrictions on submodules mentioned)
- `extra`: Additional text for error messages
- `errors`: How to handle missing/old dependencies ('raise', 'warn', 'ignore')
- `min_version`: Override the global minimum version requirement

### Intended Behavior
The function is designed to:
1. Import optional dependencies with version checking
2. Handle both missing packages and outdated versions
3. Support submodules (like 'lxml.etree')

## Key Observations

1. **VERSIONS Dictionary**: The VERSIONS dict explicitly includes 'lxml.etree' with version '4.9.2', indicating pandas intends to enforce version requirements for this specific submodule.

2. **INSTALL_MAPPING**: Maps 'lxml.etree' to 'lxml' for installation purposes, showing pandas is aware of the submodule relationship.

3. **No Documentation of Bug**: The documentation does NOT specify that:
   - Version checking should be skipped for submodules
   - Parent module versions should be used instead of submodule versions
   - The behavior where VERSIONS.get(parent) is used is intentional

4. **Usage Patterns**: Throughout pandas codebase, 'lxml.etree' is imported as a dependency with the expectation that version checking will work.

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected** (based on documentation and VERSIONS dict):
- When importing 'lxml.etree', the function should check for version >= 4.9.2
- If the version is too old, it should raise/warn based on the errors parameter

**Actual** (due to the bug):
- Version checking is silently skipped because VERSIONS.get('lxml') returns None
- Users can run with outdated lxml versions without any warning

## Conclusion

The documentation and code structure clearly indicate that version checking should work for 'lxml.etree'. The presence of 'lxml.etree' in VERSIONS with a specific version requirement demonstrates intent to validate the version. The bug violates the documented contract of the function by failing to perform version validation for this submodule.
