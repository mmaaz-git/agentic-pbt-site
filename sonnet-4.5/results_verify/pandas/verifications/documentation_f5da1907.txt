## Documentation Analysis for _parse_letter_version

The `_parse_letter_version` function is an internal helper function in pandas' vendored version parsing module, which is based on the PyPA packaging library. The code was vendored from packaging/_structures.py on 04/30/2021.

### PEP 440 Specification
According to PEP 440, the authoritative specification for Python version identifiers:

1. **Implicit Post Releases**: PEP 440 explicitly allows "implicit post releases" with the syntax `1.0-0`, which should normalize to `1.0.post0`. The PEP states: "Post releases allow omitting the post signifier all together. When using this form the separator MUST be `-` and no other form is allowed. This allows versions such as `1.0-1` to be normalized to `1.0.post1`."

2. **Post Release Zero**: The specification does NOT prohibit post release 0. The example given is `1.0-1` normalizing to `1.0.post1`, but there's no reason `1.0-0` shouldn't normalize to `1.0.post0`.

### Function Documentation
The function `_parse_letter_version` has no explicit docstring, but examining its usage and implementation:

1. **Function Signature**: `_parse_letter_version(letter: str, number: str | bytes | SupportsInt) -> tuple[str, int] | None`
   - Accepts integers via the `SupportsInt` type annotation
   - Should handle integer 0 as a valid input

2. **Usage Context**: Called from the Version class constructor when parsing version strings:
   - For post releases: `_parse_letter_version(match.group("post_l"), match.group("post_n1") or match.group("post_n2"))`
   - The regex captures "0" as a string for versions like "1.0-0"

3. **Implementation Comments**: The code contains a comment at lines 495-497:
   ```python
   # We assume if we are given a number, but we are not given a letter
   # then this is using the implicit post release syntax (e.g. 1.0-1)
   ```
   This comment indicates the function is intended to handle implicit post releases.

### Key Finding
The function signature explicitly accepts integers (`SupportsInt`), but the implementation uses `if not letter and number:` which treats integer 0 as falsy. This is inconsistent with:
1. The type signature accepting integers
2. The behavior when passed string "0" (which works correctly)
3. PEP 440's allowance for post release 0
