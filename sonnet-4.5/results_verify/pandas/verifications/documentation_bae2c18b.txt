## Documentation Analysis for AbstractMethodError

### Official Documentation
The pandas documentation for AbstractMethodError shows:
- Purpose: Replace NotImplementedError for abstract methods
- Parameters:
  - `class_instance`: The class or instance where the abstract method is not implemented
  - `methodtype`: Optional, defaults to "method" (can be "classmethod", "staticmethod", "property")

### Docstring Examples
The docstring in the source code (lines 273-292) provides two examples:
1. For classmethods: `raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(cls, methodtype="classmethod")`
2. For regular methods: `raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(self)`

**Key observation**: In the classmethod example, `cls` (the class object) is passed, not an instance.

### Type Annotations
The `__init__` method signature shows:
- `class_instance` has NO type annotation (just a positional parameter)
- `methodtype: str = "method"` is typed as string

### Parameter Name Analysis
The parameter is named `class_instance`, which is ambiguous:
- Could mean "a class or an instance" (as the official docs suggest)
- Could mean "the class of the instance"

### Documentation Intent vs Implementation
The documentation says "The class or instance where the abstract method is not implemented", suggesting both are valid.

However, the docstring examples demonstrate:
- For classmethods: use the class (cls)
- For instance methods: use the instance (self)
- No example shows using an instance with methodtype='classmethod'

### Semantic Correctness
From a Python semantics perspective:
- A classmethod receives `cls` as its first argument (the class)
- An instance method receives `self` as its first argument (the instance)
- It would be semantically incorrect to pass an instance when referring to a classmethod

### Conclusion
While the documentation allows "class or instance" as the first parameter, the actual usage pattern and Python semantics suggest that when `methodtype='classmethod'`, the first parameter should be a class, not an instance. The current implementation fails to handle the case where someone incorrectly passes an instance with `methodtype='classmethod'`.
