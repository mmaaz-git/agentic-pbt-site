## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function `dedup_names` is an internal pandas utility, not a public API. It's always called via `is_potential_multi_index()` which checks that all columns are tuples before returning True. In normal pandas usage, `dedup_names` would never receive `is_potential_multiindex=True` with non-tuple columns because `is_potential_multi_index()` returns True only when all columns (except index columns) are tuples. The bug report tests the function with invalid combinations that would never occur through normal pandas operations. The assertion exists as a type-checking guarantee that the precondition established by `is_potential_multi_index()` is maintained.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function signature accepts any boolean value for `is_potential_multiindex` without documenting the precondition that names must be tuples when True. Someone could theoretically import and use this function directly with invalid arguments. The function is technically exported and accessible as `pandas.io.common.dedup_names`.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal implementation detail in a utility function that's not meant for direct public use. The assertion only fails when the function is misused in a way that would never happen in actual pandas usage. The comment "for mypy" suggests this is for static type checking rather than runtime validation. Since this function is always called correctly within pandas itself, fixing this would add unnecessary defensive programming to an internal function.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The error message is unhelpful (bare AssertionError) and the behavior changes based on Python optimization flags (-O), which is problematic. Even internal functions should fail gracefully with clear error messages when misused.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The docstring doesn't document the precondition that when `is_potential_multiindex=True`, all names must be tuples. Adding this to the documentation would clarify the expected usage without changing any code. This would help anyone who might use this internal function directly understand its requirements.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Since this is an internal function always called correctly by pandas, documenting internal preconditions might be unnecessary. The function works correctly when used as intended within the pandas ecosystem.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report suggests the function should "handle non-tuple columns gracefully when is_potential_multiindex=True" which would be adding new functionality. Currently, the function only supports tuples when this flag is True, and supporting other types would be a new feature.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already has defined behavior for its intended use case. Adding support for non-tuple columns when `is_potential_multiindex=True` doesn't make semantic sense since MultiIndex columns are inherently tuples in pandas.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function uses an assertion for input validation, which is poor practice since assertions can be disabled with Python's -O flag. When assertions are disabled, the function fails with a confusing TypeError instead. Using assertions for input validation rather than proper error handling is generally considered a bug.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function is never called with invalid inputs in actual pandas usage. The `is_potential_multi_index()` function ensures that `is_potential_multiindex=True` only when columns are actually tuples. This is an internal consistency check, not user input validation. The assertion correctly serves its purpose as a development-time check for programmer errors, not runtime validation.

## Overall consideration
After thorough analysis, this appears to be an **INVALID** bug report. The `dedup_names` function is an internal pandas utility that is always called correctly within the pandas codebase. The `is_potential_multi_index()` function acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that `is_potential_multiindex=True` is only passed when all columns are actually tuples. The assertion exists as a type-checking aid and internal consistency check, not as user input validation.

The bug report tests the function with artificial inputs that would never occur in real pandas usage. While the error handling could theoretically be better, this would be over-engineering for an internal function that already works correctly in its intended context. The property-based test in the bug report generates invalid input combinations that violate the function's preconditions, which are implicitly enforced by the calling code.

The fact that this is marked as "for mypy" in the code comments strongly suggests this is a type-narrowing assertion for static analysis, not runtime validation. Internal functions in libraries commonly have preconditions that must be met by the calling code, and adding defensive programming for impossible scenarios would add unnecessary overhead.
