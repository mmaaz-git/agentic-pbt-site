DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Review:
---------------------

1. Official pandas documentation for hash_array:
   - States: "Given a 1d array, return an array of deterministic integers"
   - Parameters documented include vals, encoding, hash_key, and categorize
   - Returns: "ndarray[np.uint64, ndim=1] - Hashed values, same length as the vals"
   - NO mention of dtype-dependent behavior
   - NO warning that int32 and int64 versions of the same value might hash differently
   - The word "deterministic" implies consistency for the same value

2. Official pandas documentation for hash_pandas_object:
   - States: "Return a data hash of the Index/Series/DataFrame"
   - Returns: "Series of uint64, same length as the object"
   - NO mention of dtype-dependent behavior
   - NO warning about inconsistent hashing across dtypes

3. Source code docstrings (from hashing.py):
   - hash_array docstring: "Given a 1d array, return an array of deterministic integers"
   - Example shows: pd.util.hash_array(np.array([1, 2, 3]))
   - Does not specify or warn about dtype sensitivity

4. Implicit expectations:
   - Hash functions are generally expected to be value-based, not representation-based
   - The principle of "equal values should produce equal hashes" is fundamental to hashing
   - Users would reasonably expect that -1 as int32 and -1 as int64 would hash the same

Documentation gaps:
--------------------
- No documentation mentions that the hash depends on the dtype
- No warning that converting between int32 and int64 will change hash values
- The term "deterministic" is misleading - it suggests consistency for equal values
- No explanation that the function hashes the byte representation rather than the value

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation does NOT specify that hash values should be dtype-dependent. In fact, the
documentation suggests the opposite - that the function returns "deterministic integers" for
given values. Users would reasonably expect value-based hashing, where -1 produces the same
hash regardless of whether it's stored as int32 or int64.

This is either:
1. A BUG - the behavior violates reasonable expectations and the spirit of the documentation
2. A DOCUMENTATION_FIX - if this behavior is intentional, it needs explicit documentation
