## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **Class Purpose** (from pandas docs):
   - "Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
   - Described as providing "forward-looking" windows
   - Examples only show positive window_size values

2. **Parameter Documentation**:
   - window_size parameter is described as "the number of rows in a window"
   - Default value is 0
   - Type annotation shows it expects an int
   - **NO explicit documentation about valid ranges or constraints on window_size**
   - **NO mention that window_size must be non-negative**
   - **NO mention of what happens with negative values**

3. **Semantic Implications**:
   - Class name: "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" - the word "Forward" strongly implies looking ahead
   - A "forward-looking window" semantically contradicts negative window sizes
   - The method already validates that center=True is invalid for "forward-looking windows"
   - This shows the class is opinionated about what constitutes valid forward-looking behavior

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - All documentation examples use window_size=2 (positive)
   - No examples demonstrate edge cases or invalid inputs
   - The example output shows windows that look forward from the current position

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **Missing Constraints**: The documentation does not explicitly state that window_size must be >= 0
2. **Undefined Behavior**: No documentation about what happens with negative window_size
3. **Invariant Not Stated**: No mention that window bounds must satisfy start[i] <= end[i]
4. **Edge Cases**: No documentation of edge case handling

### Conclusion
While the documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit negative window_size values, the semantic meaning of "forward" windows and the fact that all examples use positive values strongly suggests that negative values were not intended to be supported. The lack of explicit validation is more likely an oversight than intentional design.
