## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The code produces window bounds where end < start, which is semantically incorrect
- This violates the fundamental invariant of window boundaries
- While not explicitly documented, the concept of a "window" inherently requires valid bounds
- The name "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" implies looking forward (positive direction)
- All documentation examples use positive window sizes
- The behavior causes downstream failures with df.rolling(), producing unexpected NaN values
- The issue represents a genuine logic error that breaks expected behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state window_size must be non-negative
- No validation exists in the current code, suggesting it might be intentional

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit negative window sizes
- The type annotation just says `int`, not `positive int`
- User is passing invalid input that doesn't make semantic sense

**Arguments Against:**
- The concept of a forward-looking window with negative size is nonsensical
- Window boundaries should always satisfy start <= end by definition
- The bug causes actual failures in downstream operations

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Negative window sizes are an edge case that wouldn't occur in normal usage
- Users shouldn't pass negative values for something called "window_size"
- The fix is trivial (don't pass negative values)

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure numerical edge case but a fundamental logic error
- The library should validate input to prevent nonsensical operations
- The issue affects core functionality (rolling operations)

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Adding validation for negative window sizes could be seen as a new feature
- The current code doesn't have this validation, so adding it is an enhancement

**Arguments Against:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Ensuring valid window bounds is a bug fix, not a feature
- The code already attempts to handle edge cases (e.g., clipping)

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation could be clearer about window_size constraints
- Adding explicit mention that window_size must be non-negative would help

**Arguments Against:**
- The primary issue is the code behavior, not the documentation
- Even with better documentation, the code should validate input
- The semantic meaning of "forward window" already implies positive size

### Final Assessment:

This is a **BUG**. The reasoning:

1. **Semantic Correctness**: Window boundaries must satisfy start <= end. This is a fundamental invariant for any window/range concept, regardless of explicit documentation.

2. **Named Intent**: "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" explicitly indicates forward-looking behavior, which is incompatible with negative sizes.

3. **Practical Impact**: The bug causes real failures in pandas rolling operations, producing incorrect results rather than raising clear errors.

4. **Expected Behavior**: While not explicitly documented, no reasonable user would expect negative window sizes to produce invalid bounds. The expected behavior would be either:
   - Raise a ValueError for invalid input (preferred)
   - Treat negative values as 0 or abs(value)

5. **Industry Standards**: Most windowing operations in data processing libraries validate that window sizes are non-negative.

The proposed fix (adding validation) is appropriate and follows good software engineering practices of failing fast with clear error messages for invalid input.
