DOCUMENTATION REVIEW FINDINGS

1. PANDAS DOCUMENTATION ON read_csv:
The pandas documentation for read_csv does NOT explicitly state how quoted values should be treated differently from unquoted values in terms of type inference. Key points:

- The quotechar parameter (default '"') defines the character used for quoting
- The documentation mentions that quoted fields can contain delimiters which will be ignored
- There is NO documentation stating that quotes should preserve string types or prevent type inference

2. NA VALUES AND TYPE INFERENCE:
According to pandas documentation:
- Default NA values include: 'NA', 'N/A', 'NaN', 'nan', 'null', 'None', etc.
- Inf-like values ('Inf', 'inf', 'infinity', etc.) are parsed as np.inf
- This parsing is case-insensitive
- The documentation does NOT distinguish between quoted and unquoted NA/Inf values

3. CONTROL PARAMETERS:
The documentation mentions these relevant parameters:
- na_values: Additional strings to recognize as NA
- keep_default_na: Whether to include default NA values (default True)
- na_filter: Option to disable NA detection entirely (default True)
- dtype: Can specify column types explicitly

Notably, when keep_default_na=False is used, the documentation states it will only use NA values specified in na_values parameter. However, this does NOT affect infinity parsing.

4. CSV RFC 4180 STANDARD:
RFC 4180 defines CSV format but:
- Does NOT specify any type inference rules
- Quotes are used to allow special characters (commas, line breaks) within fields
- The RFC does NOT say that quoted values must be preserved as strings
- Type inference is implementation-specific and not part of the standard

5. PANDAS BEHAVIOR AS DOCUMENTED:
The documentation suggests that pandas performs automatic type inference on all values regardless of quoting. There is no documented parameter or mechanism to treat quoted values differently from unquoted values during type inference.

The only way documented to preserve string values that look like special values is:
- Use dtype='str' or dtype={'col': str} (but this still converts some NA values)
- Use keep_default_na=False (only helps with NA values, not infinity)
- Use na_filter=False (only helps with NA values, not infinity)

CONCLUSION FROM DOCUMENTATION:
The pandas documentation does NOT promise that quoted values will be preserved as strings. The type inference appears to be applied uniformly to all values, quoted or unquoted. The behavior described in the bug report appears to be consistent with how pandas is documented to work.
