## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The property-based test using Hypothesis fails as described:
- Running the test with 200 examples causes a failure on the input `source='D', target='B'`
- The assertion failure occurs because `is_subperiod('D', 'B')` returns False while `is_superperiod('B', 'D')` returns True
- This violates the expected inverse relationship between these functions

### Direct Reproduction
Running the specific examples provided in the bug report confirms the inconsistent behavior:

1. **Daily to Business Day (D → B)**
   - `is_subperiod('D', 'B') = False`
   - `is_superperiod('B', 'D') = True`
   - These should be equal as inverse operations

2. **Daily to Custom Business Day (D → C)**
   - `is_subperiod('D', 'C') = False`
   - `is_superperiod('C', 'D') = True`
   - These should be equal as inverse operations

3. **Business Day to Custom Business Day (B → C)**
   - `is_subperiod('B', 'C') = False`
   - `is_superperiod('C', 'B') = True`
   - These should be equal as inverse operations

### Effect
The bug causes a logical inconsistency where:
- The code claims you cannot downsample from daily data to business day data (is_subperiod returns False)
- But simultaneously claims you can upsample from business day data to daily data (is_superperiod returns True)
- This is a contradiction because downsampling from A to B should be possible if and only if upsampling from B to A is possible

The inconsistency affects three specific frequency relationships: D↔B, D↔C, and B↔C.
