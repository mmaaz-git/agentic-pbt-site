## Reproduction Report

### Test Environment
- NumPy version: 2.3.0
- Pandas version: 2.3.2
- Python version: 3.13

### Bug Reproduction Attempt

I attempted to reproduce the reported bug using the exact code provided in the bug report:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.internals.concat import _dtype_to_na_value

dtype = np.dtype('complex128')
result = _dtype_to_na_value(dtype, False)
```

**Result**: The code executed successfully without errors, returning `(nan+0j)`.

### Additional Testing

1. **Direct NumPy behavior test**:
   - `np.complex128("NaN")` returns `(nan+0j)` (no error)
   - `np.complex64("NaN")` returns `(nan+0j)` (no error)
   - Python's built-in `complex("NaN")` also returns `(nan+0j)` (no error)

2. **Source code verification**:
   - Confirmed that line 512 in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/concat.py`
     contains `return dtype.type("NaN")` as reported

3. **Hypothesis test**:
   - The provided hypothesis test has a bug itself - it incorrectly assumes `np.complex64` returns Python's `complex` type
   - `np.complex64` returns `numpy.complex64`, which is not an instance of Python's built-in `complex` class
   - `np.complex128` returns `numpy.complex128`, which IS considered an instance of `complex` in isinstance() checks

### Conclusion

The bug described in the report does NOT reproduce in the current environment with NumPy 2.3.0.
The code that allegedly raises `ValueError: complex() arg is a malformed string` actually executes
successfully. This suggests either:

1. The bug was present in an older version of NumPy/pandas and has been fixed
2. The bug report was based on incorrect assumptions about NumPy behavior
3. There's a platform-specific difference in how NumPy handles string parsing
