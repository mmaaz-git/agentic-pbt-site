## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Test Results

1. **Simple Reproduction Test**:
   - Running `ensure_decoded(b'\x80')` raises `UnicodeDecodeError` as reported
   - Error message: "'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte"
   - This confirms the bug exists

2. **Hypothesis Property-Based Test**:
   - The test fails on many inputs with invalid UTF-8 bytes
   - Examples of failing inputs:
     - `b'\x80'` (the reported case)
     - `b'\xa9'`
     - `b'\xdb\x16'`
     - `b'\x82\xcd\xe0H\xd5\xf6\xb0\x91\\\xdfIZ'`
   - All failures are due to `UnicodeDecodeError` when the bytes cannot be decoded as UTF-8

3. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function uses `get_option("display.encoding")` which defaults to "utf-8"
   - Line 15 in common.py: `s = s.decode(get_option("display.encoding"))`
   - No error handling is present for invalid byte sequences

### Context

The function is used primarily in PyTables/HDF5 operations to decode metadata and values that come from HDF5 files. Usage found in:
- `pandas/core/computation/pytables.py`: Decoding PyTables metadata and values
- `pandas/core/computation/ops.py`: Decoding timestamps
- `pandas/io/pytables.py`: Has its own `_ensure_decoded` that only handles `np.bytes_` and hardcodes UTF-8

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
