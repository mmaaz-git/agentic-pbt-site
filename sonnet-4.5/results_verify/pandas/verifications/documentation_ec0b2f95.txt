## Documentation Analysis for _arrow_dtype_mapping

### Function Documentation Status
The `_arrow_dtype_mapping()` function in pandas/io/_util.py:
- Has NO docstring (returns None when checking __doc__)
- Is an internal/private function (indicated by leading underscore)
- Is not directly documented in the public pandas API documentation

### Function Purpose and Usage
Based on code inspection, the function:
1. Creates a mapping dictionary from PyArrow data types to pandas nullable ExtensionDtypes
2. Is used internally by pandas for converting Arrow data to pandas-compatible types
3. Is imported and used in at least 3 locations:
   - pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py - for converting Arrow arrays to pandas arrays
   - pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py - for type casting operations
   - pandas/io/_util.py itself - in arrow_table_to_pandas() function

### Expected Behavior from Context
The function should return a dictionary that maps each unique PyArrow type to its corresponding pandas dtype. Based on:
1. The Apache Arrow documentation example showing a similar mapping
2. The usage pattern in arrow_table_to_pandas() where it's used with dict.get()
3. The general principle that dictionary keys must be unique

The function SHOULD contain unique keys only, with each PyArrow type appearing exactly once.

### Documentation References Found
While the specific internal function is undocumented, the pandas documentation does cover:
- PyArrow functionality and integration patterns
- ArrowDtype usage and conversion methods
- The types_mapper parameter in pyarrow.Table.to_pandas()
- Examples showing proper Arrow-to-pandas dtype mappings

### Conclusion on Documentation
The lack of explicit documentation for this internal function does NOT excuse the duplicate key bug because:
1. Dictionary semantics in Python are well-defined - duplicate keys overwrite earlier ones
2. The function's purpose (creating a mapping) implies unique keys are required
3. The usage pattern (mapping.get()) expects each key to have one defined value
4. Even without documentation, having duplicate keys that map to the same value is clearly redundant code that serves no purpose
