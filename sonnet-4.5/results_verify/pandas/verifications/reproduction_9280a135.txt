## Reproduction of the Bug

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Test 1: Property-Based Test
The property-based test provided in the bug report passes with normal string inputs but doesn't automatically generate surrogate characters in its random test cases. This is expected behavior from Hypothesis.

### Test 2: Direct Reproduction with Surrogate Character
When testing directly with a DataFrame containing a surrogate character (U+D800):

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'col': ['\ud800']})
interchange_obj = df.__dataframe__()
result = from_dataframe(interchange_obj)
```

This code fails with exactly the error described in the bug report:
- **Error Type**: `UnicodeEncodeError`
- **Error Message**: `'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\ud800' in position 0: surrogates not allowed`
- **Location**: `/pandas/core/interchange/column.py`, line 351

### Stack Trace Analysis
The error occurs during the conversion process when `from_dataframe()` attempts to encode string data:
1. `from_dataframe()` is called with the interchange object
2. It calls `protocol_df_chunk_to_pandas()`
3. Which calls `string_column_to_ndarray()`
4. Which calls `col.get_buffers()`
5. Which calls `_get_data_buffer()`
6. At line 351, the code executes: `b.extend(obj.encode(encoding="utf-8"))`
7. This line fails because UTF-8 cannot encode surrogate characters

### Key Observations
1. Pandas DataFrames can store surrogate characters without issues
2. The DataFrame interchange protocol implementation assumes all strings can be encoded as UTF-8
3. The crash occurs during the interchange protocol's string marshaling process
4. The bug report's description and reproduction steps are accurate
