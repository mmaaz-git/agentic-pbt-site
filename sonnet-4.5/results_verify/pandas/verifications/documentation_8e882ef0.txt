DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR pandas.Series.abs()

1. PANDAS DOCUMENTATION:
The pandas documentation for Series.abs() states that it "returns a Series with the absolute value of each numeric element." The documentation describes the expected behavior for different numeric types including:
- Real numbers: Returns the non-negative magnitude
- Complex numbers: Calculates sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
- Timedelta: Returns the absolute duration

The documentation DOES NOT mention:
- Any limitations regarding integer overflow
- Special behavior for the minimum int64 value
- That the result might be negative in any case
- Any warnings about edge cases with integer types

2. NUMPY DOCUMENTATION:
Since pandas.Series.abs() internally uses numpy.absolute(), I checked the numpy documentation. The numpy.absolute() documentation also DOES NOT mention:
- Integer overflow behavior
- That abs(min_int64) returns a negative value
- Any warnings about this edge case

3. MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION:
The mathematical definition of absolute value states that |x| â‰¥ 0 for all real numbers x. The documentation says abs() returns "the non-negative magnitude" which aligns with this mathematical property.

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:
The bug report indicates that pandas directly delegates to numpy's abs function via `self._unary_method(np.abs)`. This means pandas inherits numpy's integer overflow behavior.

5. KEY OBSERVATION:
Neither pandas nor numpy documentation explicitly states that abs() can return negative values due to integer overflow. The documentation describes the function as returning "absolute value" and "non-negative magnitude" without qualifying this statement with exceptions for integer overflow cases.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not warn users that Series.abs() can violate the fundamental mathematical property of absolute value (always non-negative) when applied to the minimum int64 value. Users reading the documentation would reasonably expect abs() to always return non-negative values based on both the mathematical definition and the documentation's description.
