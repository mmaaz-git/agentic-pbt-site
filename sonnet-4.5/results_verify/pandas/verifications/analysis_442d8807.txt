TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function returns negative values for length, which is mathematically nonsensical
- The docstring says it returns "the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Python's len() function NEVER returns negative values, so this violates expected behavior
- The function fails to match the actual behavior of slicing (len(array[slice]))
- This can cause downstream errors in code that assumes lengths are non-negative
- The fix is straightforward: wrap the result in max(0, ...)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is in pandas.core which is marked as PRIVATE/internal
- Could argue it's an implementation detail not meant for public use

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state "must return non-negative"
- It's an internal function in pandas.core

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- "Length" has a well-established meaning that excludes negative values
- The docstring clearly states it returns "expected length" which should match len()
- Just because documentation doesn't state the obvious doesn't make incorrect behavior valid

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be considered an obscure edge case (out-of-bounds slicing)
- Internal function that users shouldn't directly call

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is NOT an obscure edge case - out-of-bounds indexing is common
- Even internal functions should have correct behavior
- This could affect pandas operations that rely on this function
- The fix is trivial (add max(0, ...))

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame it as "add support for out-of-bounds slices"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This isn't adding new functionality, it's fixing incorrect behavior
- The function already handles these cases, just incorrectly
- Returning correct lengths isn't a feature, it's a bug fix

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could update docs to say "may return negative for out-of-bounds"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
- "Length" inherently means non-negative

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Fundamental Violation**: Returning negative length violates the mathematical definition of "length"

2. **Clear Expected Behavior**: The function should return len(target[indexer]), which is always >= 0

3. **Not Edge Case**: Out-of-bounds slicing is common in data manipulation

4. **Real Impact**: Can cause errors in downstream code expecting non-negative lengths

5. **Simple Fix**: The solution is trivial - add max(0, ...) to ensure non-negative result

6. **Semantic Correctness**: Even without explicit documentation, "length" has universally understood constraints

This is not a documentation issue, not a missing feature, and not something that should be ignored. It's a logic bug that produces impossible values (negative lengths) and should be fixed.
