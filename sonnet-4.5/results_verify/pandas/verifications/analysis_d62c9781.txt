## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence For:**
1. **Data Loss**: Fractional day components are silently truncated, losing hours/minutes/seconds
2. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Two functions in the same module (`_parse_datetime` and `_convert_datetimes`) handle the same data differently
3. **Violates SAS Standards**: SAS format specification supports fractional days, pandas should preserve them
4. **No Documentation of Truncation**: The function doesn't document that it truncates fractional days
5. **Asymmetric Implementation**: The 's' (seconds) path preserves fractional components, but 'd' (days) path doesn't
6. **Silent Failure**: No warning when precision is lost

**Evidence Against:**
- These are internal functions (prefixed with _), not public API

#### INVALID
**Evidence For:**
- Functions are internal (underscore-prefixed), not part of public API
- Could argue users shouldn't rely on internal function behavior

**Evidence Against:**
- The functions are imported and used by the public `read_sas()` function
- Data loss is a serious issue regardless of internal status
- Inconsistency between two related functions is problematic

#### WONTFIX
**Evidence For:**
- Could be considered an edge case (fractional days might be uncommon)
- Internal functions may have lower priority

**Evidence Against:**
- Data loss is not trivial - losing up to 23:59:59 of time data
- Easy fix available (as shown in bug report)
- Affects data integrity when reading SAS files

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Evidence For:**
- Could document that fractional days are truncated
- Add warning about precision loss

**Evidence Against:**
- The behavior appears to be a bug, not intended design
- Sister function `_parse_datetime` preserves fractional days
- Documenting data loss doesn't fix the underlying problem

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Evidence For:**
- Could frame as "add support for fractional days"

**Evidence Against:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- SAS format already supports fractional days
- The 's' path already handles fractional components correctly

### Critical Factors

1. **Data Integrity**: This bug causes silent data loss, which is serious
2. **Consistency**: Two functions handling the same conversion behave differently
3. **Standards Compliance**: SAS format supports fractional days; pandas should too
4. **Easy Fix**: The solution is straightforward and aligns with existing code patterns

### Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. While the functions are internal, they:
1. Cause actual data loss when reading SAS files
2. Violate the principle of least surprise (silent truncation)
3. Are inconsistent with related functionality
4. Have no documented reason for the truncation
5. Can be easily fixed to match the behavior of the 's' (seconds) path

The fact that these are internal functions doesn't diminish the seriousness of data loss when users read SAS files through the public `read_sas()` API.
