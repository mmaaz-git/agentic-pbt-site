BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Analyzing the bug report against the five possible categories:

1. INVALID - Could this be an invalid bug report?
   NO. The bug report is valid because:
   - The documented behavior is explicit: all() should return True and any() should return False for all-NA arrays with skipna=True
   - The current implementation raises TypeError instead of returning these values
   - Other pandas array types (IntegerArray, BooleanArray) handle this case correctly
   - The docstrings include specific examples showing the expected behavior

2. WONTFIX - Is this a trivial or unimportant issue?
   NO. This is not trivial because:
   - It breaks API consistency across pandas array types
   - Users reasonably expect reduction operations to work on all array types
   - All-NA arrays can occur naturally in data processing workflows (filtering, missing data)
   - The error message is misleading (suggests upgrading pyarrow won't fix null-type arrays)

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Is this asking for new functionality?
   NO. This is not a feature request because:
   - The functionality is already documented in the method docstrings
   - Examples in the documentation show this should work
   - Other array types already support this behavior
   - The API contract explicitly defines what should happen

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Is the documentation wrong?
   NO. The documentation is correct because:
   - The documented behavior is sensible and consistent with pandas conventions
   - Other array implementations follow this same pattern
   - The behavior makes logical sense (all-NA with skipna=True behaves like empty)
   - The code should be fixed to match the documentation, not vice versa

5. BUG - Is this a valid bug that should be fixed?
   YES. This is a valid bug because:
   - The implementation violates the documented API contract
   - The docstrings explicitly state the expected behavior for all-NA arrays
   - Other pandas array types handle this case correctly
   - The current TypeError prevents users from using basic reduction operations on null-type arrays
   - The fix is straightforward: handle null-type arrays as a special case before delegating to pyarrow

Additional Considerations:
- The bug affects a specific edge case (null-type arrays) that pyarrow doesn't natively handle
- The proposed fix in the bug report is reasonable and follows pandas conventions
- This is a contract violation bug where the implementation doesn't match the documentation

DECISION: BUG - This is a valid bug report that should be filed and fixed.
