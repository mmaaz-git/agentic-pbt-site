## Reproduction Report

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
- Ran the property-based test with Hypothesis as described in the bug report
- The test failed immediately on input '\x00' (null byte character)
- Multiple failures were observed with strings containing null bytes
- The exact error matched the report: `tokenize.TokenError: ('source code cannot contain null bytes', (1, 0))`

### Direct Example Reproduction
- Tested the minimal reproduction case: `parsing.clean_column_name('\x00')`
- Confirmed it raises `tokenize.TokenError` instead of returning the name unmodified
- The full stack trace shows the error originates from Python's tokenizer when it encounters null bytes

### Key Finding
The bug is real and occurs exactly as described. When `clean_column_name` receives a string containing null bytes (e.g., '\x00'), it crashes with a `TokenError` instead of gracefully returning the name unmodified as the documentation promises.

### Exception Hierarchy Verification
- Confirmed that `tokenize.TokenError` is NOT a subclass of `SyntaxError`
- `TokenError` inherits directly from `Exception`, not from `SyntaxError`
- This explains why the current `except SyntaxError` clause doesn't catch it

### Proposed Fix Verification
I tested the proposed fix of catching both `SyntaxError` and `tokenize.TokenError`, and it correctly:
- Returns null-byte containing strings unmodified instead of crashing
- Maintains existing behavior for other invalid identifiers
- Preserves idempotence property (applying the function twice gives the same result)
