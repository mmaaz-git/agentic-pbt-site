Bug Triage Analysis
====================

## BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
1. The pandas documentation explicitly states that to_json() and read_json() support "round-trip data conversion"
2. The JSON output preserves decimal notation (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), providing enough information to preserve dtype
3. This causes silent data corruption - the dtype changes without warning
4. Real-world impact: Financial data, scientific measurements often have whole-number float values
5. The behavior violates the principle of least surprise - users expect round-trip to preserve types
6. The test shows a clear, reproducible failure of documented functionality

**Arguments Against:**
- JSON spec doesn't enforce type distinction between integers and floats
- The numeric values themselves are preserved (just the type changes)

## INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- JSON doesn't inherently distinguish between 1 and 1.0 at the spec level
- Some might argue pandas is just doing "smart" type inference

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation explicitly promises round-trip capability
- The JSON output from pandas includes ".0" notation, indicating float intent
- This is not unspecified behavior - round-trip is a documented feature

## WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could be considered an edge case (whole-number floats)
- Values are technically preserved, just the type changes

**Arguments Against:**
- Not an obscure edge case - whole-number floats are common in real data
- Causes actual problems in production code (type-dependent operations fail)
- Silent data corruption is never a "WONTFIX" issue

## FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that preserving exact dtypes is a new feature request
- User could work around with dtype parameter in read_json

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not a new feature - round-trip is already documented as supported
- This is a bug in existing functionality, not a request for new functionality

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could update docs to warn about this limitation
- Documentation could clarify that dtype preservation isn't guaranteed

**Arguments Against:**
- The code is broken, not the documentation
- Documentation correctly describes the intended behavior (round-trip support)
- Fixing docs to match broken behavior would be accepting a regression

## Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The pandas documentation explicitly promises round-trip capability between to_json() and read_json(). The JSON output preserves decimal notation (1.0 vs 1), providing sufficient information to maintain the original dtype. The current behavior causes silent data corruption that affects real-world use cases. This is not an edge case or unspecified behavior - it's a failure of documented functionality that should work.
