DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

Function Definitions:
--------------------

1. is_subperiod(source, target):
   - Docstring: "Returns True if downsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"
   - Purpose: Checks if you can downsample from source frequency to target frequency
   - Example: Downsampling from 'h' (hourly) to 'D' (daily) should return True

2. is_superperiod(source, target):
   - Docstring: "Returns True if upsampling is possible between source and target frequencies"
   - Purpose: Checks if you can upsample from source frequency to target frequency
   - Example: Upsampling from 'D' (daily) to 'h' (hourly) should return True

Expected Behavior from Documentation:
-------------------------------------

Based on the docstrings and general time series principles:

1. Inverse Relationship:
   - If is_subperiod(A, B) returns True, then is_superperiod(B, A) should also return True
   - This represents the same frequency relationship from different perspectives
   - Downsampling from A to B is equivalent to upsampling from B to A

2. Non-circular Relationship:
   - Two frequencies cannot both be superperiods of each other
   - If is_superperiod(A, B) is True, then is_superperiod(B, A) must be False
   - This would violate the fundamental principle that one frequency must be finer than the other

3. Business Day vs Calendar Day:
   - 'B' (business day) represents 5 days per week (Monday-Friday)
   - 'D' (calendar day) represents all 7 days per week
   - Calendar days are more frequent than business days
   - Therefore: 'D' should be a subperiod of 'B' (can downsample daily to business daily)

Implementation Analysis:
-----------------------

Looking at the actual source code:

1. is_subperiod implementation:
   - For target='B': only allows source in {'B', 'h', 'min', 's', 'ms', 'us', 'ns'}
   - Missing 'D' and 'C' from the allowed sources
   - This prevents downsampling from daily to business daily

2. is_superperiod implementation:
   - For source='D': allows target in {'D', 'C', 'B', 'h', 'min', 's', 'ms', 'us', 'ns'}
   - For source='B': allows target in {'D', 'C', 'B', 'h', 'min', 's', 'ms', 'us', 'ns'}
   - Both include each other as valid targets, creating a circular relationship

Documentation vs Implementation:
-------------------------------

The implementation violates the documented behavior in two ways:

1. The inverse relationship is broken:
   - is_subperiod('D', 'B') = False
   - is_superperiod('B', 'D') = True
   - These should be equal according to the relationship between downsampling and upsampling

2. A circular superperiod relationship exists:
   - is_superperiod('D', 'B') = True
   - is_superperiod('B', 'D') = True
   - This is mathematically impossible and violates the concept of frequency hierarchy

Conclusion:
----------
The documentation clearly indicates these functions should maintain an inverse relationship and represent upsampling/downsampling operations. The current implementation violates these documented principles for the 'D' and 'B' frequency pair, making this a legitimate bug in the code rather than a documentation issue.
