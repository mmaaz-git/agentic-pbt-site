## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The tests confirm the following behavior:

### Bug Confirmed
1. **Empty numpy float array fails**: When passing `np.array([])` (which defaults to dtype=float64) to `check_array_indexer`, it raises an IndexError with message "arrays used as indices must be of integer or boolean type".

2. **Empty Python list works**: When passing an empty Python list `[]`, it gets converted properly and returns an empty integer array with dtype=int64.

3. **Empty integer array works**: When explicitly creating an empty integer array with `np.array([], dtype=np.int64)`, it works correctly.

### Additional Discovery
4. **Empty boolean array fails differently**: An empty boolean array `np.array([], dtype=bool)` also fails but with a different error: "Boolean index has wrong length: 0 instead of 5". This suggests boolean arrays have different validation logic.

### Verification of the Reported Behavior
- The property-based test fails exactly as reported when `indices=[]` is passed, because `np.array([])` creates a float64 array.
- The error message matches exactly: "arrays used as indices must be of integer or boolean type"
- The inconsistency is real: empty Python lists are handled specially but empty numpy arrays are not.

### Impact
This is a real inconsistency in the API where:
- `check_array_indexer(arr, [])` works
- `check_array_indexer(arr, np.array([]))` fails
- `check_array_indexer(arr, np.array([], dtype=np.int64))` works

This is counterintuitive because an empty array has no elements, so its dtype shouldn't matter for indexing purposes. Users who naturally create empty arrays with numpy (which defaults to float64) will encounter this unexpected error.
