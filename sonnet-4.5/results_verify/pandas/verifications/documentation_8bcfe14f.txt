DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR pandas.core.indexes.api.union_indexes._find_common_index_dtype

1. PUBLIC API DOCUMENTATION:
   - union_indexes is an internal API function (not publicly documented in pandas API reference)
   - The function is not listed in the official pandas documentation at pandas.pydata.org
   - Related public method is Index.union() which is well-documented

2. SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION:
   The function _find_common_index_dtype has clear docstring documentation:
   - Parameters section clearly states: "inds: list of Index or list objects"
   - Returns section describes: "The common type or None if no indexes were given"
   - The docstring correctly documents the intended parameter name as "inds"

3. DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR vs IMPLEMENTATION:
   - The docstring says the parameter is "inds"
   - The function signature declares parameter "inds"
   - BUT the implementation uses "indexes" from outer scope instead
   - This is a clear mismatch between documentation and implementation

4. INTERNAL FUNCTION STATUS:
   - _find_common_index_dtype is a nested function inside union_indexes
   - It's prefixed with underscore indicating internal/private use
   - It's only called within union_indexes itself

5. CONCLUSION:
   The documentation (docstring) correctly describes what the function SHOULD do.
   The implementation does not follow its own documented interface.
   This is a code bug, not a documentation issue.
