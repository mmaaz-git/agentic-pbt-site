## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The code crashes when converting an exception to a string, which violates a fundamental Python contract - all exceptions should be convertible to strings
2. The constructor accepts any object without type checking, suggesting both classes and instances are valid inputs
3. The parameter is ambiguously named `class_instance`, implying it can be either
4. All other methodtypes work correctly with instances; only 'classmethod' crashes
5. The fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent
6. Users might legitimately create these errors programmatically and pass instances

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The examples show the "correct" usage pattern (cls for classmethods)
- One could argue users should follow the examples

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The docstring examples demonstrate passing `cls` for classmethods
2. It's semantically odd to pass an instance when the methodtype is 'classmethod'
3. The user is arguably using the API incorrectly

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation never explicitly forbids passing instances
2. The constructor accepts the input without validation
3. The parameter name `class_instance` suggests both are acceptable
4. Crashing when converting to string is never acceptable for exceptions

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. This is an edge case - users rarely manually construct AbstractMethodError
2. Following the documented examples avoids the issue
3. The error only affects incorrect usage patterns

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Exception objects should NEVER crash when converting to string
2. The fix is trivial (one-line change)
3. It's not an obscure edge case - it's a basic operation (str()) on a valid object

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation could be clearer about requirements
2. The parameter name `class_instance` is confusing
3. Could add explicit note about passing classes for classmethods

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code is broken, not just the documentation
2. Even with better documentation, the crash is unacceptable
3. The code should be defensive and handle both cases

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could be seen as requesting support for a new use case (instances with classmethod)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
2. The constructor already accepts these inputs
3. It's about making existing functionality work correctly

## Conclusion:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The decisive factors are:

1. **Fundamental Contract Violation**: Exception objects must always be convertible to strings without crashing. This is a basic Python expectation.

2. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The constructor accepts the input but __str__ crashes. If instances weren't allowed for classmethods, the constructor should reject them.

3. **No Explicit Documentation**: Nothing in the documentation forbids this usage. The parameter name even suggests both classes and instances are valid.

4. **Simple Fix**: The proposed fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent and robust.

5. **Defensive Programming**: Even if this usage is "incorrect," the code should handle it gracefully rather than crashing.

The fact that str(exception) can crash is unacceptable regardless of whether the usage pattern is ideal. This is a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
