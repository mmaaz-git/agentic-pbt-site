DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR _trim_zeros_float

Function: pandas.io.formats.format._trim_zeros_float

SOURCE OF DOCUMENTATION:
The function is an internal/private function (indicated by the leading underscore) with only a docstring as documentation. There is no public API documentation for this function on the pandas website.

DOCSTRING TEXT:
"Trims the maximum number of trailing zeros equally from all numbers containing decimals, leaving just one if necessary."

KEY PHRASE ANALYSIS:
The docstring contains the phrase "equally from all numbers containing decimals" which is central to the bug report. The word "equally" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple ways:

1. "Equally" could mean: trim the SAME NUMBER of zeros from each number
2. "Equally" could mean: trim zeros SIMULTANEOUSLY from all numbers until any number would lose its last non-zero digit
3. "Equally" could mean: ensure all numbers end up with EQUAL decimal lengths

WHAT THE CODE ACTUALLY DOES:
The implementation uses a while loop with a should_trim() function that:
1. Checks if ALL decimal numbers end in '0'
2. If true, removes one trailing character from each decimal number
3. Repeats until at least one number doesn't end in '0'
4. Adds back a '0' if any number ends with just a decimal point

This means the function trims zeros iteratively and stops as soon as ANY number no longer has a trailing zero. This causes numbers with fewer trailing zeros to stop trimming first, resulting in unequal decimal lengths.

AMBIGUITY IN DOCUMENTATION:
The docstring's use of "equally" is ambiguous. The actual behavior is that the function performs "simultaneous trimming until any number can't be trimmed further" rather than "trimming the same amount from each number" or "ensuring equal decimal lengths in output".

INTERNAL VS PUBLIC FUNCTION:
This is a private function (starts with underscore), which typically indicates it's for internal use only and not part of the public API. Private functions often have less rigorous documentation requirements and their behavior may be tailored to specific internal use cases rather than general-purpose usage.
