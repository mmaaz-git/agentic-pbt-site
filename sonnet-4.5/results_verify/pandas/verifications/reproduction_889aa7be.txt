# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
The bug report is CORRECT. There is indeed a typo in the error message in `pandas.core.sample.preprocess_weights` function.

## Reproduction Steps
1. I located the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/sample.py`
2. Verified the typo exists on line 70: "weight vector many not include negative values"
3. Ran the provided reproduction code which confirmed the typo
4. Ran the hypothesis-based property test which also failed due to the typo

## Test Results

### Simple Reproduction Test
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3]})
weights = pd.Series([-1, 0, 1])
df.sample(n=1, weights=weights)
```
Result: ValueError with message "weight vector many not include negative values"

### Property-Based Test
The hypothesis test with negative weights consistently produces the error message with the typo "many not" instead of "may not".

## Bug Impact
This is a simple typo in an error message. When negative weights are provided to the sample() function, the error message says "many not" instead of the grammatically correct "may not".

## Conclusion
The bug is REAL and REPRODUCIBLE. The error message contains a grammatical error that should be fixed for better user experience and clarity.
