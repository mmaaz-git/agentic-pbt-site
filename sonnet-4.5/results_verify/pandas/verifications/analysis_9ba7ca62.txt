BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

Analyzing the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect)
   Arguments FOR:
   - hash_tuples is an INTERNAL function, not part of public API
   - Users should not be calling internal functions directly
   - The error comes from MultiIndex.from_tuples() which has a legitimate reason for requiring level information
   - There's no documented contract that all internal hashing functions must handle empty inputs identically
   - Internal functions may have different requirements than public ones

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The function does exist and is importable
   - The inconsistency is real and measurable
   - Other internal hashing functions handle empty inputs gracefully

2. WONTFIX (Bug is trivial/uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - This is an edge case for an internal function
   - Empty tuple lists are uncommon in practice
   - The error message is clear about what went wrong
   - Users can easily work around this with a simple check
   - Internal API changes have lower priority

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The fix is simple and would improve consistency
   - Could prevent unexpected errors in code using pandas internals

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Handling empty inputs gracefully could be seen as a new feature
   - The function never claimed to support empty inputs
   - This is asking for additional input validation/handling

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Other similar functions already handle this case
   - This is more about consistency than new functionality

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The docstring could specify that empty inputs are not supported
   - Documentation could clarify the relationship with MultiIndex requirements

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation isn't wrong, just incomplete
   - Internal function documentation has less stringent requirements

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Inconsistent behavior across similar functions in the same module
   - Violates principle of least surprise
   - The proposed fix is simple and reasonable
   - Would improve API consistency even for internal functions

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Internal function not meant for public use
   - The error is from a legitimate MultiIndex limitation
   - No documented contract violation

CONCLUSION:
The strongest case is for INVALID because:
1. This is an internal function not part of the public API
2. Users should not be directly calling pandas.core.util.hashing functions
3. The error originates from a well-understood MultiIndex limitation
4. There's no documentation establishing that internal hashing functions must handle empty inputs consistently
5. Internal implementation details are allowed to vary
