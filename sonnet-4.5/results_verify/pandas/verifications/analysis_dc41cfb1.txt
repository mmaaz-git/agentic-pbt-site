=== BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS ===

## INVALID (Reasons to consider):
- None. The bug report is factually correct and reproducible.
- The mathematical definition of variance unambiguously requires non-negative values.
- The code demonstrably returns negative values that violate this requirement.

## WONTFIX (Reasons to consider):
- Could argue: "It's just a numerical precision issue with extreme values"
  COUNTER: Variance being negative is not a minor precision issue - it's a fundamental violation of mathematical properties that can corrupt analyses
- Could argue: "Only happens with very specific edge cases"
  COUNTER: Hypothesis found multiple failing cases; this affects real-world data with large value ranges
- Could argue: "Users should handle numerical instability themselves"
  COUNTER: Libraries should implement numerically stable algorithms; users expect correct mathematical results

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Reasons to consider):
- Could argue: "Documentation should warn about numerical instability"
  COUNTER: This isn't about documenting limitations - the function is returning mathematically impossible results
- Could argue: "Documentation should specify precision limitations"
  COUNTER: No amount of documentation makes negative variance acceptable; the implementation needs fixing

## FEATURE_REQUEST (Reasons to consider):
- Could argue: "Request for numerically stable algorithm"
  COUNTER: This isn't a new feature - it's fixing broken existing functionality
- Could argue: "Request for better handling of extreme values"
  COUNTER: Correct variance calculation is core functionality, not an enhancement

## BUG (Strong evidence):
✓ Violates fundamental mathematical property (variance MUST be ≥ 0)
✓ Returns objectively incorrect results (-511.67 instead of 1.33)
✓ Reproducible with specific inputs
✓ Caused by numerical instability in the implementation
✓ Silent data corruption with no warnings
✓ Affects real-world use cases (financial data, sensor readings with different scales)
✓ NumPy correctly handles the same calculation
✓ Well-known solution exists (Welford's algorithm, compensated summation)
✓ The error magnitude is severe (off by ~513, not just small precision errors)

## SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
HIGH SEVERITY because:
1. Mathematical correctness violation (not just imprecision)
2. Silent failure - no errors or warnings
3. Can propagate to downstream calculations (standard deviation, confidence intervals)
4. Affects statistical validity of analyses
5. Error magnitude is large (hundreds of units, not just rounding errors)

## PRECEDENT AND STANDARDS:
- Major statistical libraries (NumPy, R, SciPy) handle this correctly
- Numerical stability in variance calculation is a solved problem in computer science
- Standard algorithms exist specifically to prevent this issue

## CONCLUSION:
This is unequivocally a BUG. The function returns mathematically impossible values that violate the fundamental definition of variance. This is not a documentation issue, feature request, or acceptable limitation - it's a correctness bug in the implementation that needs to be fixed using numerically stable algorithms.
