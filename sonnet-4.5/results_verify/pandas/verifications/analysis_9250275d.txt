## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function's docstring explicitly states "no entry is *rounded* to 0% or 100%" unless already equal to it
- The value 1.401298464324817e-45 is mathematically non-zero (not equal to 0.0)
- The docstring also states "Any non-integer is always rounded to at least 1 decimal place"
- The input value when multiplied by 100 is not an integer, yet displays as "0%" without decimals
- This is a clear violation of the documented contract
- The function is used internally by pandas' `describe()` method, which could mislead users about data distribution

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is an extreme edge case with denormalized floating-point numbers
- In practical data analysis, values this small (1e-45) are essentially zero
- The issue only affects values smaller than 1e-10, which are rarely meaningful in real-world percentiles

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The failing value (1.401298464324817e-45) is so small it's practically indistinguishable from zero
- This is an obscure edge case that would virtually never occur in real-world data analysis
- The computational cost of handling such extreme precision might not be justified
- For all practical purposes, displaying "0%" for values smaller than 1e-10 is reasonable

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The docstring makes an explicit promise about not rounding to 0%
- The contract is clear and unambiguous - violating it is a bug regardless of how rare
- The function already handles other edge cases (near 100%) correctly

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug report correctly identifies a violation of the documented behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The reproduction is accurate
- The documentation clearly states the expected behavior
- The test demonstrates the violation

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be updated to say "extremely small values (< 1e-10) may round to 0%"
- This would align the documentation with the current implementation
- It acknowledges the practical limitation of floating-point representation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The current documentation makes a clear promise that should be honored
- Changing documentation to match buggy behavior is not ideal
- The fix proposed in the bug report is reasonable and implementable

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Handling denormalized floats could be seen as a new feature beyond original scope
- Scientific notation display for extremely small values could be a feature enhancement

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The docstring already promises this behavior - it's not a new feature
- This is fixing existing functionality to match its specification

### Conclusion
This is a **BUG**. While the failing case involves an extremely small number that's unlikely in practice, the function's docstring makes explicit promises that are being violated:
1. Non-zero values should not round to exactly "0%"
2. Non-integer percentages should have at least one decimal place

The function should either:
- Honor its contract and display these values with appropriate precision (even if using scientific notation)
- Or at minimum display "0.0%" to show it has been rounded but maintains a decimal place

The bug report is technically correct, well-documented, and identifies a genuine contract violation in the code.
