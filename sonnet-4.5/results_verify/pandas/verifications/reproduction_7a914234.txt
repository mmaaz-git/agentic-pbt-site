## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported about a typo in the pandas.core.sample.preprocess_weights function error message.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Verified the source code**: I examined the actual source code of pandas.core.sample.preprocess_weights and confirmed that line 49 contains the typo:
   ```python
   if (weights < 0).any():
       raise ValueError("weight vector many not include negative values")
   ```
   The word "many" should be "may".

2. **Ran the Hypothesis test**: The property-based test provided in the bug report passes successfully, confirming that any negative weight value triggers the error message with the typo.

3. **Ran the direct reproduction example**: Created a DataFrame with negative weights and confirmed the exact error message:
   - Input: DataFrame with weights array [1.0, 2.0, -1.0, 3.0, 4.0]
   - Output: ValueError with message "weight vector many not include negative values"
   - Expected: "weight vector may not include negative values"

4. **Additional verification**: Tested multiple scenarios:
   - Positive weights: Work correctly
   - Zero weights: Work correctly (zeros are ignored as documented)
   - Negative weights: Consistently raise ValueError with the typo

### Effect of the Bug
The bug is a simple typographical error in an error message. When users provide negative weights to DataFrame.sample() or related functions, they receive an error message with incorrect grammar ("many" instead of "may"). This is a minor issue that affects only the readability and professionalism of the error message, not the functionality of the code.

### Confirmation
The bug is 100% reproducible and exists in pandas version 2.3.2. The error message consistently shows "weight vector many not include negative values" when it should show "weight vector may not include negative values".
