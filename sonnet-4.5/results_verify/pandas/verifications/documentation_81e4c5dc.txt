## Documentation Analysis for SparseArray.cumsum()

### Official Documentation Review

1. **SparseArray Class Documentation**:
   - SparseArray is an ExtensionArray for storing sparse data
   - Default fill values are type-dependent: 0 for integers, NaN for floats
   - The class is designed to efficiently store arrays where many values equal a specific "fill value"

2. **cumsum Method Documentation**:
   - While specific documentation for SparseArray.cumsum() is limited in current versions, older documentation (v0.24) indicates:
     - The method should perform cumulative sum of non-NA/null values
     - It should preserve the sparse structure where appropriate
   - No documentation mentions that cumsum should fail or raise RecursionError for non-null fill values

3. **Expected Behavior Based on numpy.cumsum**:
   - numpy.cumsum returns a new array with cumulative sums
   - Example: np.cumsum([1,2,3]) returns [1, 3, 6]
   - SparseArray methods generally aim to provide numpy-compatible behavior

4. **Implicit Expectations**:
   - A method named "cumsum" has an obvious and well-established meaning in numerical computing
   - Users reasonably expect cumsum to compute cumulative sums, not crash
   - The fact that it works for float arrays (fill_value=NaN) but not integer arrays (fill_value=0) suggests inconsistent behavior

### Documentation Gaps
- No documentation warns that cumsum will fail for non-null fill values
- No documentation suggests cumsum is only supported for arrays with null fill values
- The behavior difference between integer and float sparse arrays is not documented

### Conclusion
The documentation does not indicate that cumsum should fail for integer sparse arrays. The method name itself implies standard cumulative sum functionality, which should work regardless of the fill value. The infinite recursion is clearly unintended behavior that violates reasonable user expectations based on:
1. The method name's established meaning
2. The fact that it works correctly for float arrays
3. The absence of any documentation suggesting limitations based on fill value type
