REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

Bug Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug with pandas.io.json's to_json() function. The issue occurs exactly as described in the bug report.

Test Results:
-------------

1. With the specific failing value (1.5932223682757467):
   - Original value: 1.59322236827574670
   - JSON output (default): [{"col":1.5932223683}]
   - Restored value: 1.59322236829999997
   - Round-trip equality: FALSE

   The value is truncated to 10 significant digits (1.5932223683) in the JSON output, causing precision loss.

2. Testing with double_precision=15:
   - Original value: 1.59322236827574670
   - JSON output: [{"values":1.593222368275747}]
   - Restored value: 1.59322236827574715
   - Round-trip equality: FALSE (but very close, likely due to float representation limits)

3. Comparison with Python's standard json module:
   - The standard json module preserves full float64 precision by default
   - Same value round-trips perfectly: 1.5932223682757467
   - Round-trip equality with standard json: TRUE

Effect of the Bug:
-----------------
The bug causes silent data corruption for float64 values with more than 10 significant digits. This is particularly problematic because:

1. The precision loss is silent - no warning is given to users
2. Float64 can represent approximately 15-17 significant decimal digits
3. The default setting (double_precision=10) only preserves 10 digits
4. This violates the reasonable expectation that serialization should be lossless by default

The bug is real and affects data integrity in pandas DataFrames when using JSON serialization with default settings.
