REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.SparseArray.cumsum.

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   The property-based test provided in the bug report triggers a RecursionError as claimed.
   Running the test with any non-empty list of non-negative integers causes the error.
   The test itself is valid - it's checking that cumulative sums should be monotonically
   increasing for non-negative values, which is a correct mathematical property.

2. SIMPLE EXAMPLE REPRODUCTION:
   The simple example provided also reproduces the bug exactly as described:

   ```python
   sparse = pd.arrays.SparseArray([1, 0, 2, 0, 3])
   result = sparse.cumsum()  # RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
   ```

   When I tested this:
   - The SparseArray has fill_value=0 (the default for integer arrays)
   - The _null_fill_value property is False (because 0 is not considered a null value)
   - Calling cumsum() triggers infinite recursion and crashes with RecursionError

3. SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS:
   I examined the source code at pandas/core/arrays/sparse/array.py:1550.
   The bug is exactly as described in the report:

   ```python
   if not self._null_fill_value:
       return SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()  # Line 1550
   ```

   This creates infinite recursion because:
   - When _null_fill_value is False (e.g., fill_value=0)
   - It converts to dense array: self.to_dense() -> numpy.ndarray
   - Creates new SparseArray from dense: SparseArray(...)
   - The new SparseArray inherits fill_value=0, so _null_fill_value is still False
   - Calls cumsum() on the new SparseArray, which repeats the cycle infinitely

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   Testing with numpy arrays and pandas Series shows the expected cumsum result:
   Input: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3]
   Expected cumsum: [1, 1, 3, 3, 6]

   When SparseArray has fill_value=None (NaN), cumsum works correctly and produces
   the expected result because _null_fill_value is True in that case.

5. IMPACT:
   This bug makes cumsum() completely unusable for any SparseArray with a non-null
   fill value. This includes the common case of fill_value=0 (the default for integer
   sparse arrays), making it a high-impact bug affecting core functionality.

The bug report is accurate in all its claims about the problem, the cause, and the impact.
