Key Findings:

1. PRIVATE FUNCTION STATUS: The function name starts with an underscore (_split_line), indicating it is a private/internal function not intended for public API use.

2. NO PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION: Web searches revealed no public documentation for this function on pandas.pydata.org or in the official pandas documentation. This is expected for private functions.

3. DOCSTRING MENTIONS UNDERSCORE FILTERING: The docstring explicitly states "name '_' will be filtered from output" which indicates that the function is designed to filter out fields named '_'.

4. NO REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTATION: The docstring does NOT specify that the parts parameter MUST contain a '_' field. It only states that if present, it will be filtered out.

5. INTERNAL USAGE PATTERN: All three internal uses of this function within the same file include a '_' field in the parts parameter:
   - Line 306: fif includes ["_", 24]
   - Line 334-335: mem includes ["_", 32]
   - Line 337: mem includes ["_", 16]

6. IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL: Line 174 contains an unconditional `del out["_"]` statement that will raise KeyError if '_' is not in the dictionary.

7. XPORT FORMAT CONTEXT: This function is part of the SAS XPORT file format reader, which is a specialized format with fixed-width fields. The '_' fields appear to be padding/reserved fields in the XPORT format specification that need to be discarded.

Conclusion from Documentation:
The docstring states that '_' will be filtered from output but does not document that '_' is required to be present. This creates an ambiguity - the documentation suggests filtering is optional ("will be filtered") but the implementation makes it mandatory.
