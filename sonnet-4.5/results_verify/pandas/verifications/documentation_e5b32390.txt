## Documentation Analysis for _handle_truncated_float_vec

### Function Documentation:
- The function `_handle_truncated_float_vec` is a private/internal function (indicated by leading underscore)
- It has NO docstring or public documentation
- Not part of the public pandas API (returns 404 on pandas docs)

### Context from Code Comments:
The function includes comments explaining its purpose:
- "This feature is not well documented, but some SAS XPORT files have 2-7 byte 'truncated' floats"
- "To read these truncated floats, pad them with zeros on the right to make 8 byte floats"
- References GitHub PR and R "foreign" library for implementation details

### Critical Finding from Code Analysis:
In the same file (sas_xport.py), lines 369-371 show that field_length is ALREADY VALIDATED at the header parsing stage:
```python
if field["ntype"] == "numeric" and ((fl < 2) or (fl > 8)):
    msg = f"Floating field width {fl} is not between 2 and 8."
    raise TypeError(msg)
```

This means:
1. The function `_handle_truncated_float_vec` is ONLY called with nbytes values between 2 and 8
2. The validation happens at the data format parsing level, not in this helper function
3. The function is an internal implementation detail that relies on this precondition

### SAS XPORT Format:
- External documentation about XPORT format doesn't specify details about truncated floats
- The feature appears to be an undocumented or poorly documented aspect of some XPORT files
- The implementation is based on reverse engineering and compatibility with R's foreign library

### Conclusion on Documentation:
This is an internal helper function that operates under the precondition that nbytes is already validated to be between 2 and 8. The function itself has no documentation specifying valid input ranges because it's not meant to be called directly with arbitrary values - it's only called from within the XPORT reader after validation has already occurred.
