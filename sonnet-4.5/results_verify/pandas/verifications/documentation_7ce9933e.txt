## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **Method Documentation in Source Code**:
   The cumsum() method docstring in the source code (lines 1529-1543) states:
   - "Cumulative sum of non-NA/null values"
   - "When performing the cumulative summation, any non-NA/null values will be skipped"
   - "The resulting SparseArray will preserve the locations of NaN values, but the fill value will be `np.nan` regardless"
   - Returns: "cumsum : SparseArray"

2. **Expected Behavior Based on Documentation**:
   - The method should compute cumulative sums
   - It should handle NA/null values appropriately
   - It should return a SparseArray

3. **NumPy cumsum Standard Behavior**:
   - For `[1, 0, 0, 2]`, numpy.cumsum returns `[1, 1, 1, 3]`
   - This is the universally understood behavior of cumulative sum

### Documentation Assessment

**The documentation is incomplete and potentially misleading**:

1. The docstring talks about "non-NA/null values will be skipped" which is confusing wording. It seems to mean that NA/null values are preserved in their positions (not included in the sum), not that non-NA values are skipped.

2. The documentation does NOT mention any special behavior for non-null fill values that would justify infinite recursion.

3. The documentation claims the method returns a SparseArray with cumulative sums, but the current implementation crashes with RecursionError for most common use cases (any array with fill_value=0).

4. There is no documentation warning that the method only works for arrays with NaN as fill value.

### Comparison with Expected Functionality

Based on the method name "cumsum" and general numpy/pandas conventions:
- The method should perform cumulative summation just like numpy.cumsum
- It should work for all valid SparseArrays, not just those with NaN fill values
- A RecursionError is clearly not expected behavior for a cumsum operation

### Conclusion

The implementation does not match the documented behavior. The documentation promises cumulative sum functionality but the code fails with infinite recursion for the most common case (integer arrays with fill_value=0). There is no documentation that would suggest this failure is expected or acceptable behavior.
