## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The pandas documentation clearly states that primary_key accepts "bool or None" as valid types. The function is working exactly as documented from pandas' perspective - it accepts boolean values and passes them through to the output schema. If pandas never claimed to produce Table Schema compliant output for all input combinations, then this might not be a bug but rather a misunderstanding of the function's contract.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function is explicitly named build_table_schema and its purpose is to "Create a Table schema from data." The Table Schema is a well-defined specification from Frictionless Data, and the function clearly aims to produce output compliant with that specification. The fact that it produces valid Table Schema output for primary_key=None but invalid output for boolean values strongly suggests this is unintended behavior that violates the function's core purpose.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered an edge case where users are passing boolean values when they should be passing None or specific column names. The workaround is trivial - just use None instead of True/False. Since the default is None which works correctly, and the documentation examples only show the None case, this might be considered too minor to fix given potential backward compatibility concerns.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it fundamentally breaks interoperability with any tool expecting valid Table Schema JSON. The function's entire purpose is to create Table Schema compliant output, and failing to do so for documented parameter values is a significant failure. The bug makes the boolean parameter values completely unusable for their intended purpose.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to clarify that boolean values for primary_key will produce non-standard Table Schema output and should not be used if Table Schema compliance is required. The documentation could specify that only None should be used for Table Schema compliant output, and boolean values are a legacy feature that produces non-standard output.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function is specifically designed to build Table Schema compliant JSON, as evidenced by its name and the fact that it works correctly with primary_key=None. Simply documenting that boolean values produce invalid output doesn't fix the fundamental problem that the function fails at its core purpose when given certain documented parameter values. The code behavior is clearly wrong, not the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that proper handling of boolean primary_key values to produce valid Table Schema output is a new feature that was never implemented. The current behavior might be seen as a placeholder that was never fully developed, and adding proper conversion logic would be a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already accepts boolean values as documented parameters, so this isn't asking for new functionality but rather fixing existing functionality to work correctly. The parameter is already there and documented - it just produces incorrect output. This is clearly a bug in existing functionality rather than a request for new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a clear violation of the Table Schema specification that the function claims to implement. The function accepts documented parameter values (True/False) but produces invalid, non-compliant output that breaks interoperability with any Table Schema consuming tool. The fact that primary_key=None works correctly shows the function is intended to produce valid Table Schema, making the boolean case a clear bug. The issue is technically correct, well-documented, and represents a fundamental failure of the function's core purpose.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The pandas documentation doesn't explicitly promise Table Schema compliance for all parameter combinations. It's possible that boolean values were intended for some other use case or internal purpose, even though this seems unlikely given the function's name and purpose. Without explicit documentation stating that all parameter values must produce Table Schema compliant output, this could be seen as undefined behavior rather than a bug.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a valid BUG. The function pandas.io.json.build_table_schema has a clear and specific purpose: to build Table Schema compliant JSON from pandas DataFrames. The Table Schema specification is explicit that primaryKey must be either a string or an array of strings, never a boolean. When the function accepts documented parameter values (primary_key=True/False) but produces output that violates the specification it claims to implement, this is unquestionably a bug.

The bug report is technically accurate and well-documented. The hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue, and the manual reproduction confirms the problem. The suggested fix is reasonable and would align the function's behavior with both its documented purpose and the Table Schema specification. While one might argue for DOCUMENTATION_FIX to warn users about this behavior, the correct solution is to fix the code to produce valid output.

This is not a trivial edge case or a matter of interpretation - it's a clear failure to implement a well-defined specification correctly. The fact that 90% of bug reports from this user are invalid doesn't change the technical merits of this particular report, which is sound and identifies a genuine problem that breaks interoperability with the broader data ecosystem.
