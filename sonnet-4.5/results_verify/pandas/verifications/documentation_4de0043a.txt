# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation

The `convert_to_line_delimits` function has the following docstring:
```python
def convert_to_line_delimits(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Helper function that converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON.
    """
```

## Key Documentation Findings

### 1. Function Purpose
The docstring clearly states that this function should "convert JSON lists to line delimited JSON." This is an important specification because:
- JSON lists are defined in the JSON specification as values enclosed in `[` and `]`
- The function should only operate on valid JSON lists
- Non-JSON-list inputs should presumably be left unchanged

### 2. JSON List Definition
According to the JSON specification (RFC 7159):
- A JSON list (array) begins with `[` and ends with `]`
- Example: `[1, 2, 3]` or `["a", "b", "c"]`
- A string like `"[abc"` is NOT a valid JSON list because it lacks the closing `]`

### 3. JSON Lines Format
Based on research of the JSON Lines (JSONL) format:
- JSON Lines is a format where each line contains a valid JSON value
- It's commonly used for streaming and processing large datasets
- The format separates JSON objects/values with newline characters

### 4. Expected Behavior Analysis
Given the docstring and JSON standards:
1. **Valid JSON lists** (e.g., `"[1,2,3]"`) should be converted to line-delimited format
2. **Invalid JSON lists** (e.g., `"[abc"`, `"["`, `"abc]"`) should NOT be processed
3. The function should check that input both starts with `[` AND ends with `]`

### 5. Internal Implementation Details
The function uses `convert_json_to_lines` from `pandas._libs.writers`, which:
- "replaces comma separated json with line feeds"
- Pays special attention to quotes & brackets
- Expects the brackets to already be stripped from the input

### 6. Code Comment Analysis
Line 36-37 has a comment:
```python
# Determine we have a JSON list to turn to lines otherwise just return the
# json object, only lists can
```
This comment reinforces that:
- The function should determine if the input is a JSON list
- If it's not a JSON list, it should return the original string unchanged
- Only lists should be processed

## Documentation Conclusion

The documentation and code comments clearly indicate that:
1. The function should only process valid JSON lists (strings starting with `[` AND ending with `]`)
2. Non-JSON-list inputs should be returned unchanged
3. The current implementation has a bug that causes it to process malformed inputs like `"[abc"`

The bug report correctly identifies that the function violates its documented behavior by processing strings that are not valid JSON lists.
