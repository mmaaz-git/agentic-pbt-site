## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the key findings:

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is real and reproducible. The function `pandas.api.types.pandas_dtype()` behaves inconsistently when handling pandas Series objects:

1. **For Series with int64/float64 dtype**: Works correctly, returns the dtype
   - `pandas_dtype(pd.Series([1, 2, 3]))` returns `int64`
   - `pandas_dtype(pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))` returns `float64`

2. **For Series with object dtype**: Raises TypeError with confusing message
   - `pandas_dtype(pd.Series([None]))` raises: `TypeError: dtype '0    None\ndtype: object' not understood`
   - `pandas_dtype(pd.Series(['a', 1, None]))` raises similar error

### Root Cause
The issue occurs because:
1. Series is not an instance of `np.ndarray`, so it doesn't hit the first check
2. Series is not an instance of `np.dtype` or `ExtensionDtype`, so it doesn't hit the second check
3. The function then calls `np.dtype(series)` to try to convert it
4. For Series with int64/float64, `np.dtype()` returns the corresponding dtype
5. For Series with object dtype, `np.dtype()` returns object dtype
6. The function then checks if `npdtype.kind == "O"` and raises TypeError for object dtypes
7. The error message includes the string representation of the entire Series, making it confusing

### Inconsistency
The key inconsistency is that:
- `pandas_dtype(series.dtype)` works for ALL Series types (returns the dtype)
- `pandas_dtype(series)` only works for non-object Series types

This violates the principle of uniform handling - if the function accepts Series objects, it should handle them consistently regardless of their dtype.
