## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs when pandas.describe() is called with extremely small percentile values (e.g., 5e-324).

### Test Results:

1. **With percentiles=[5e-324]:**
   - Output index: ['count', 'mean', 'std', 'min', 'nan%', 'nan%', 'max']
   - The median '50%' is MISSING from the output
   - Invalid 'nan%' labels are produced instead of proper percentile labels
   - Multiple RuntimeWarnings about overflow and invalid values are generated

2. **With slightly larger but still small percentiles (1e-300, 1e-100, 1e-10):**
   - These work correctly and include '50%' in the output
   - The issue appears specific to extremely small values near the float64 minimum

3. **Hypothesis test results:**
   - The hypothesis test fails, confirming that the median is not always included
   - Various small percentile values trigger the bug (e.g., 2.225073858507203e-309)
   - The test produces 'inf%' and 'nan%' labels in some cases

### Root Cause:

The bug occurs due to numerical overflow in the precision calculation in pandas/io/formats/format.py. When calculating the precision for formatting extremely small percentiles:
- The log10 of tiny differences produces very large negative values
- This causes overflow when converting to int for precision
- The overflow leads to NaN values in the formatted percentile labels
- The median (50%) gets lost in the process

The bug report accurately identifies the issue and provides a valid reproduction case.
