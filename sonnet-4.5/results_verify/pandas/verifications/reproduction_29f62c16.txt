Bug Reproduction Results for pandas.arrays.SparseArray.cumsum()

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. CONFIRMED: Infinite Recursion with Non-Null Fill Values
   - Test case: SparseArray([0], fill_value=0) causes RecursionError
   - Test case: SparseArray([0, 1, 0, 2], fill_value=0) causes RecursionError
   - Any SparseArray with fill_value that is not NA/null (e.g., 0, -1, 1) triggers infinite recursion

2. CONFIRMED: Normal Operation with Null Fill Values
   - Test case: SparseArray([0, 1, np.nan, 2], fill_value=np.nan) works correctly
   - Returns expected cumsum result: [0, 1, nan, 3]
   - Fill value of result is np.nan as documented

3. CONFIRMED: Root Cause Analysis
   The bug occurs exactly as described in the report:
   - When _null_fill_value is False (non-null fill value), the code executes:
     return SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()
   - This creates a new SparseArray that still has the same non-null fill value
   - The new SparseArray calls cumsum() again, entering infinite recursion
   - Stack trace shows recursion at line 1550 of array.py

4. Property-Based Testing Results
   - The hypothesis test confirmed that any SparseArray with non-null fill values fails
   - Multiple RecursionError exceptions were raised during testing
   - The recursion limit of 100 was quickly exceeded

5. Expected vs Actual Behavior
   Expected (based on documentation and numpy behavior):
   - SparseArray([0, 1, 0, 2], fill_value=0).cumsum() should return [0, 1, 1, 3] with fill_value=np.nan
   Actual:
   - RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

The bug is 100% reproducible and matches the description in the bug report exactly. The proposed fix of calling cumsum() on the dense numpy array (rather than the SparseArray wrapper) appears to be correct.
