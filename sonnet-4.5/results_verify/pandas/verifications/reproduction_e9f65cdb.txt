BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. CONFIRMED: The bug exists as described
The function `_convert_datetimes` with unit='d' does indeed truncate fractional day values to whole days.

Test Results:
- Input: 0.5 days → Expected: 1960-01-01 12:00:00 → Actual: 1960-01-01 00:00:00 (lost 12 hours)
- Input: 1.5 days → Expected: 1960-01-02 12:00:00 → Actual: 1960-01-02 00:00:00 (lost 12 hours)
- Input: 0.25 days → Lost 21600 seconds (6 hours)
- Input: 0.75 days → Lost 64800 seconds (18 hours)

2. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
Line 107 in sas7bdat.py uses `dtype="M8[D]"` which converts to NumPy datetime64 with day precision.
This automatically truncates any fractional days to whole days.

3. INCONSISTENCY CONFIRMED:
The scalar function `_parse_datetime` correctly preserves fractional days:
- _parse_datetime(1.5, "d") → 1960-01-02 12:00:00 ✓ (correct)
- _convert_datetimes([1.5], "d") → 1960-01-02 00:00:00 ✗ (truncated)

4. DATA PATH ANALYSIS:
When reading SAS files:
- SAS stores date columns as float64 values
- These values can have fractional parts representing time of day
- The function receives these as a pandas Series of float64
- The conversion to "M8[D]" discards the fractional parts

5. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
The provided hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue:
- Test fails for any input with fractional days
- Test passes only for whole number days (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, etc.)

6. IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- Data Loss: Yes - fractional parts are silently discarded
- Silent Failure: Yes - no warning or error is raised
- Inconsistent Behavior: Yes - differs from _parse_datetime
- Real-world Impact: Potentially significant for SAS files that store precise timestamps as date values

7. PROPOSED FIX VERIFICATION:
The bug report's proposed fix would:
- Convert days to seconds (multiply by 86400)
- Create datetime64 with second precision
- This would preserve the fractional day information

TECHNICAL ACCURACY OF BUG REPORT: CORRECT
The bug report accurately describes the problem, identifies the root cause, and provides a valid fix.
