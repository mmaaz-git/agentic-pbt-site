DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Available Documentation

1. **Function Docstring**: The function has minimal documentation:
   ```python
   def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
       """
       Return the expected length of target[indexer]

       Returns
       -------
       int
       """
   ```

2. **Public Documentation**: The function `pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer` is NOT documented in the public pandas API documentation. It is part of the pandas.core module which is marked as PRIVATE.

## Documentation Findings

### What the Documentation Says
- The function should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- It returns an int
- No specific behavior is documented for edge cases

### What the Documentation Doesn't Say
- The documentation does NOT specify what happens with out-of-bounds slices
- The documentation does NOT state that the function can return negative values
- The documentation does NOT clarify behavior for empty results

## Interpretation

The phrase "expected length of target[indexer]" strongly implies that the function should return the same value as `len(target[indexer])`. This is the most natural interpretation because:

1. **Mathematical Definition**: Length is a non-negative quantity by definition
2. **Python Convention**: The len() function NEVER returns negative values
3. **Semantic Meaning**: "Length" universally means "count of elements", which cannot be negative
4. **User Expectation**: Any reasonable user would expect this function to match Python's slicing behavior

## Conclusion on Documentation

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state "must return non-negative values", this is implied by:
1. The use of the word "length" which has a well-established meaning
2. The stated purpose of returning "the expected length of target[indexer]"
3. The fact that `len(target[indexer])` would never return negative values

The current behavior (returning negative values) violates the reasonable interpretation of the documentation. The documentation doesn't need to explicitly state "non-negative" because that's inherent in the concept of "length".
