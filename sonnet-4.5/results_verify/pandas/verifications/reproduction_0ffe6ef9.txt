## Bug Reproduction Report

### Test Environment
- Pandas version: 2.3.2
- Python version: 3.13

### Reproduction Results

1. **Simple Test Case**: When running the code from the bug report:
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]})
rolling = df.rolling(window=2, step=0)
result = rolling.mean()
```

**Actual Error**: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
**Expected (per report)**: ValueError: slice step cannot be zero

The error occurs in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/indexers/objects.py:110` in `get_window_bounds` when calling:
```python
end = np.arange(1 + offset, num_values + 1 + offset, step, dtype="int64")
```

2. **Hypothesis Test**: The hypothesis test also fails with ZeroDivisionError when step=0.

### Key Findings

1. The bug report is fundamentally correct: `step=0` passes validation but causes a crash during computation.

2. The specific error differs from the bug report:
   - Report claims: ValueError with "slice step cannot be zero"
   - Actually get: ZeroDivisionError in np.arange()

3. The validation code (lines 212-213 in rolling.py) does indeed only check `if self.step < 0`, allowing `step=0` to pass through.

4. The code shows defensive programming in line 223: `(self.step or 1)` to avoid issues with step=0, but this doesn't catch all cases.

### Conclusion

The bug exists and is reproducible. The essence of the bug (step=0 passes validation but crashes during computation) is correct, though the specific error message differs from what was reported.
