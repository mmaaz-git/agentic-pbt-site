## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be INVALID:**
- These are internal functions (not public API) with specific implementation needs
- The functions may intentionally have asymmetric behavior for internal pandas operations
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise an inverse relationship
- A pandas developer previously stated these methods shouldn't return True for equal frequencies "for that internal usage"

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The docstrings clearly state "downsampling" and "upsampling" which are mathematical inverses
- The violation creates logical inconsistencies that could lead to bugs
- The asymmetry is not documented or justified anywhere
- Even internal functions should follow logical consistency

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- These are internal functions not meant for public use
- Fixing might break existing internal pandas functionality that depends on current behavior
- The impact is limited since these are not public API functions
- Previous issue #18553 shows similar inconsistencies weren't fixed

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The bug affects fundamental frequency conversion logic
- It could cause subtle bugs in resampling operations
- The fix is straightforward and improves logical consistency
- Internal code quality matters for maintainability

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The functions work as implemented but documentation is misleading
- Could clarify that these aren't true mathematical inverses
- Could document that B, C, and D have special relationships
- The docstrings could explain the asymmetric behavior is intentional

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is genuinely incorrect, not just poorly documented
- "Downsampling" and "upsampling" have clear mathematical meanings
- Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it correct
- The asymmetry appears to be a bug, not a feature

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Request for new behavior (inverse relationship) not originally intended
- Could be asking for enhanced functionality beyond current design
- Might require new public API functions with guaranteed inverse properties

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The inverse relationship is implicit in the function names and purposes
- The fix corrects an implementation error, doesn't add features

### Consideration for BUG

**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Logical inconsistency**: The functions violate the mathematical definition of inverse operations
2. **Clear asymmetry in code**: Lines show "D" and "C" are included in one direction but not the other
3. **Semantic violation**: "Downsampling from A to B" should imply "upsampling from B to A"
4. **Potential for errors**: This could cause incorrect resampling behavior in edge cases
5. **Simple fix available**: The bug report provides a clear, logical fix
6. **Multiple violations**: 7 frequency pairs violate the inverse relationship

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- Internal functions might have intentional quirks for specific use cases
- Not explicitly documented to be inverses

### Analysis Summary

This appears to be a legitimate BUG in the implementation. While these are internal functions, they have clear semantic meanings (downsampling/upsampling) that imply an inverse relationship. The asymmetric implementation for business day frequencies (B, C) and daily frequency (D) is not justified by any documentation or comments, and appears to be an oversight rather than intentional design.

The fact that `is_superperiod('B', 'D')` returns True (can upsample from business day to daily) while `is_subperiod('D', 'B')` returns False (cannot downsample from daily to business day) is logically inconsistent. If you can convert from business days to calendar days, you should be able to convert from calendar days to business days.

### Recommendation

This should be categorized as **BUG** - a valid bug report that should be filed and fixed.
