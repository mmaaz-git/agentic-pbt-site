# Reproduction Analysis

## Bug Report Validation

The bug report has been successfully reproduced using both the provided Hypothesis test and manual example.

## Hypothesis Test Results

The property-based test using Hypothesis confirmed the bug:
- Test failed with `num_values=2, window_size=-1`
- The assertion `np.all(start <= end)` failed, confirming that start positions exceed end positions
- This violates the fundamental invariant for window bounds

## Manual Test Results

The manual reproduction test confirmed the exact behavior described in the bug report:
- Input: `FixedForwardWindowIndexer(window_size=-1)` with `num_values=2`
- Output:
  - start array: [0, 1]
  - end array: [0, 0]
- At index 1: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0, which is invalid

## Effect of the Bug

When a negative window_size is provided to FixedForwardWindowIndexer:
1. The indexer accepts the negative value without validation
2. The get_window_bounds() method returns invalid bounds where start > end
3. These invalid bounds cannot be used for array slicing as they violate the basic contract that start <= end
4. Any downstream code using these bounds would fail or produce incorrect results

## Conclusion

The bug is real and reproducible. The FixedForwardWindowIndexer class does not validate that window_size is non-negative, leading to invalid window bounds when negative values are provided. This is a logic error that produces mathematically invalid results.
