## Documentation Analysis for CSSResolver.size_to_pt

### pandas documentation findings:
- CSSResolver appears to be an internal/private class in pandas.io.formats.css module
- No public API documentation exists for CSSResolver or the size_to_pt method
- The class is not documented in the official pandas API reference
- This appears to be an internal utility used by pandas for CSS parsing in table styling

### CSS specification findings (W3C):
According to the official W3C CSS specifications:

1. CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 (https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/):
   - CSS numbers can be written in scientific notation
   - Numbers can be "concluded by the letter 'e' or 'E' followed by an integer indicating the base-ten exponent"
   - Scientific notation is part of the valid CSS number syntax

2. CSS Syntax Module Level 3 (https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/):
   - The number-token parsing algorithm explicitly supports scientific notation
   - Valid formats include patterns like: 1e-5, 2.5e3, -3.14E+2
   - The spec includes specific steps for parsing E/e followed by optional +/- and digits

### Key observations:
- Scientific notation (e.g., "1e-5pt", "2.5e3px") is VALID CSS according to W3C specifications
- The pandas CSSResolver.size_to_pt method is an internal implementation detail
- Since this is CSS parsing code, it should follow CSS specifications for compatibility
- The lack of public documentation means users shouldn't directly rely on this API, but pandas internally uses it for CSS processing in styling operations
