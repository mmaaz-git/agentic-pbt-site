## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is working as designed - it trims zeros iteratively from all numbers until any number would lose a significant digit. The word "equally" in the docstring could reasonably be interpreted to mean "simultaneously" or "in the same iterative process" rather than "the same amount". The function is private (starts with underscore) and may have been designed for a specific internal use case where this behavior is desired. The docstring never explicitly states that all outputs should have the same decimal length.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies that the function produces unequal decimal lengths, and the word "equally" in the docstring does suggest some form of equality in the trimming process. The reproduction confirms the behavior described in the bug report is accurate.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a private internal function (indicated by the leading underscore) that is not part of the public API. Private functions often have specific behaviors tailored to internal use cases. The current behavior may be exactly what's needed for pandas' internal formatting purposes. Changing it could break existing internal functionality. The issue only affects edge cases where numbers have different amounts of trailing zeros, which may be rare in practice.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
If this function is used in any way that affects user-visible output, the inconsistent decimal lengths could be confusing. The docstring does use the word "equally" which suggests the current behavior might not be intentional.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The docstring's use of "equally" is ambiguous and doesn't accurately describe the function's actual behavior. The function does trim zeros from all numbers simultaneously in each iteration, but doesn't ensure equal amounts are trimmed or equal decimal lengths in output. A clearer docstring would be: "Iteratively trims trailing zeros from all decimal numbers until any number would lose a non-zero digit, leaving at least one decimal place." This is the most likely correct categorization since the code works consistently but the documentation is misleading.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the original intent was truly to trim the same number of zeros from each number (as the word "equally" suggests), then the implementation is wrong and this would be a bug rather than a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user might be requesting new functionality - a function that ensures all outputs have the same decimal length. This could be a valid enhancement request for a new parameter or a new function that provides this behavior. The current function works for its intended purpose, but a new feature could provide the equal-length behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report isn't asking for new functionality but claiming the existing function doesn't match its documentation. The report focuses on the discrepancy between documented and actual behavior rather than requesting a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The docstring explicitly states "equally from all numbers" which strongly suggests all numbers should be treated the same way, receiving the same amount of trimming. The current implementation clearly violates this by producing outputs with different decimal lengths when inputs have different amounts of trailing zeros. The word "equally" is not ambiguous in standard English - it means "in equal amounts" or "to the same degree".

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is a private internal function that may be working exactly as intended for its specific use case within pandas. The word "equally" could be interpreted as "simultaneously" rather than "same amount". The function has likely been in production for years without issues, suggesting the current behavior is acceptable for its actual use cases. Private functions have lower documentation standards and their behavior is often tailored to specific internal needs rather than general-purpose usage.

**Overall consideration**
This bug report hinges entirely on the interpretation of the word "equally" in the docstring. The function is private (starts with underscore), which indicates it's for internal use only and not part of the public API. Private functions typically have less rigorous documentation and their behavior is often tailored to specific internal requirements rather than general intuitive behavior.

The current implementation performs iterative trimming where all numbers are processed simultaneously in each iteration, stopping when any number would lose a significant digit. This could reasonably be described as trimming "equally" in the sense that all numbers are treated by the same algorithm simultaneously. However, the word "equally" more naturally suggests equal amounts or equal results.

Given that this is a private internal function, the most appropriate resolution would be a DOCUMENTATION_FIX to clarify what the function actually does, rather than changing long-standing behavior that may be relied upon internally. The docstring should be updated to accurately describe that the function "iteratively trims trailing zeros from all decimal numbers until any number would lose its last digit" rather than using the ambiguous term "equally".
