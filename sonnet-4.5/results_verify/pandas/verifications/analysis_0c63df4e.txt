## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if we interpret the assertion as an intentional design choice that implicitly requires `name` to be a class attribute. The code has been working this way, and developers who use class attributes don't encounter this issue. One could argue that the assertion serves as an implicit specification that `name` must be a class attribute.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The base class explicitly defines `name` as an abstract property with the `@property` decorator, which strongly suggests that subclasses should implement it as a property. The documentation doesn't state that `name` must be a class attribute, and following the natural pattern from the abstract base class leads to this error. This is a genuine inconsistency between the base class design and the implementation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered WONTFIX if the pandas maintainers consider this an edge case that affects very few users. Most existing ExtensionDtype implementations in the pandas ecosystem likely use class attributes for `name`, and changing this behavior might risk breaking backward compatibility. The workaround (using class attributes) is simple and already widely adopted.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial edge case but a fundamental inconsistency in the API design. The base class explicitly defines `name` as a property, leading developers to naturally implement it that way. The error message (AssertionError) provides no useful information to help developers understand what went wrong. This violates the principle of least surprise and creates unnecessary confusion.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is a strong candidate for DOCUMENTATION_FIX because the current documentation doesn't specify that `name` must be implemented as a class attribute despite the base class defining it as a property. Adding clear documentation about this requirement would prevent developers from encountering this confusing error. The code technically works as designed, but the design intent isn't properly documented.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting this restriction doesn't resolve the fundamental inconsistency between the base class design (abstract property) and the implementation requirement (class attribute). Good API design shouldn't require documentation to explain away contradictions. The base class pattern suggests one implementation approach while the actual code requires another.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting both class attributes and properties for `name` could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The current implementation only supports class attributes, and adding property support would be extending functionality. This would require changing the implementation to handle both cases gracefully.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but rather for the code to work as the base class design already suggests it should. When a base class defines something as an abstract property, subclasses implementing it as a property is the expected behavior, not a new feature. This is about fixing an inconsistency, not adding capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This represents a clear inconsistency in the pandas API where the base class defines `name` as an abstract property but the implementation assumes it's a class attribute. The base class pattern leads developers to implement `name` as a property, which then fails with an unhelpful AssertionError. This violates the Liskov Substitution Principle and creates a trap for developers following standard Python patterns. The fix is straightforward and wouldn't break existing code.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The code has been working this way for a long time, and the vast majority of ExtensionDtype implementations use class attributes successfully. One could argue this is working as intended, just not as ideally designed. The assertion could be seen as an intentional (if undocumented) requirement rather than a bug.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a DOCUMENTATION_FIX rather than a BUG. While there is a genuine inconsistency between the base class design (abstract property) and the implementation requirements (class attribute), the code has been functioning this way intentionally. The assertion at line 289 appears to be a deliberate choice to require class attributes, even if this contradicts the base class pattern.

The core issue is that the documentation fails to clarify this requirement. Developers naturally follow the base class pattern and implement `name` as a property, only to encounter a cryptic AssertionError. The documentation should explicitly state that despite `name` being defined as an abstract property in the base class, it must be implemented as a class attribute in subclasses for `construct_from_string` to work correctly.

While fixing the code to handle both cases would be ideal, the more pragmatic solution is to document the existing behavior clearly. This acknowledges the current implementation as the intended behavior while helping developers avoid this confusion. The proposed code fix in the bug report would work, but changing long-standing behavior in a widely-used library like pandas requires careful consideration of backward compatibility and may not be worth the risk for what is ultimately a documentation issue.
