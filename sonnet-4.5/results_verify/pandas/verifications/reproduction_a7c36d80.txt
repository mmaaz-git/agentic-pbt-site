## Reproduction of Bug Report

I successfully reproduced the reported bug in pandas.core.indexers.utils.length_of_indexer.

### Test Results:

1. **Simple reproduction case**: `range(0, 1, 2)`
   - `length_of_indexer(range(0, 1, 2))` returns: 0
   - `len(range(0, 1, 2))` returns: 1
   - The function incorrectly returns 0 when it should return 1

2. **Property-based testing with Hypothesis**:
   - The property test revealed numerous failing cases
   - Pattern observed: When step doesn't evenly divide (stop - start), the calculation fails
   - Examples of failures:
     - range(0, 1, 2): computed 0, expected 1
     - range(95, 130, 20): computed 1, expected 2
     - range(47, 138, 18): computed 5, expected 6

3. **Source code inspection** (line 326 of utils.py):
   ```python
   elif isinstance(indexer, range):
       return (indexer.stop - indexer.start) // indexer.step
   ```

   This formula uses floor division which truncates, losing the "remainder" elements.
   For range(0, 1, 2): (1 - 0) // 2 = 0, but there's actually 1 element (0).

### Bug Impact:

The bug is real and affects any code that relies on `length_of_indexer` to accurately determine the length of range objects, particularly when the step doesn't evenly divide the range span. This could impact:
- Rolling window operations
- Indexing operations
- Any pandas functionality that needs accurate indexer lengths

The bug report is accurate in both its diagnosis and the failing examples provided.
