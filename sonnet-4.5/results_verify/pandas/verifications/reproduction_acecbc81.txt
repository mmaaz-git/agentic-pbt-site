## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Reproduction Result
I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as reported. The code crashes with:
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\ud800' in position 0: surrogates not allowed
```

### Technical Details Confirmed

1. **The bug is real**: Running `hash_array(np.array(['\ud800'], dtype=object))` does indeed raise UnicodeEncodeError.

2. **The root cause is accurate**: The error occurs in the Cython function `hash_object_array` which tries to encode the string to UTF-8, but surrogate characters (U+D800 to U+DFFF) are invalid in UTF-8.

3. **The error handling gap is real**: The code at lines 325-331 in hashing.py has:
   ```python
   try:
       vals = hash_object_array(vals, hash_key, encoding)
   except TypeError:
       # we have mixed types
       vals = hash_object_array(vals.astype(str).astype(object), hash_key, encoding)
   ```
   This catches TypeError but NOT UnicodeEncodeError.

4. **Surrogate characters context**:
   - Surrogate characters ARE valid Python strings
   - They are used internally for UTF-16 encoding
   - They are INVALID in UTF-8 encoding
   - Python's `encode('utf-8')` rejects them by default
   - Python offers `errors='surrogatepass'` or `errors='replace'` to handle them

5. **The proposed fix would not fully work**: The bug report suggests catching UnicodeEncodeError alongside TypeError, but the fallback path (converting to str) would still fail because it calls the same `hash_object_array` function that will encounter the same UTF-8 encoding issue.

### Behavior Analysis

The function crashes on valid Python data (a numpy array containing valid Python strings). While surrogate characters are technically invalid UTF-8, they are valid Python strings that can exist in memory and be manipulated. The function accepts "object" dtype arrays which can contain any Python object, including strings with surrogates.

The crash is unhandled - there's no graceful degradation or informative error message. The function just raises an exception from deep in the Cython code.
