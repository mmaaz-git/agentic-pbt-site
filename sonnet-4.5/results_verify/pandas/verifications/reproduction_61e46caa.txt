## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Claims Verification

The bug report claims that `ensure_python_int` raises `OverflowError` instead of `TypeError` when called with infinity values. This claim has been verified as **100% accurate**.

### Test Results

1. **float('inf')**:
   - Expected: TypeError
   - Actual: OverflowError with message "cannot convert float infinity to integer"
   - **BUG CONFIRMED**

2. **float('-inf')**:
   - Expected: TypeError
   - Actual: OverflowError with message "cannot convert float infinity to integer"
   - **BUG CONFIRMED**

3. **float('nan')**:
   - Expected: TypeError
   - Actual: TypeError with message "Wrong type <class 'float'> for value nan"
   - **WORKS CORRECTLY** (ValueError from int() is caught and re-raised as TypeError)

4. **Valid float (5.0)**:
   - Expected: Successful conversion to int(5)
   - Actual: Returns int(5)
   - **WORKS CORRECTLY**

5. **Invalid float (5.5)**:
   - Expected: TypeError
   - Actual: TypeError with message "Wrong type <class 'float'> for value 5.5"
   - **WORKS CORRECTLY** (AssertionError from value check is caught and re-raised as TypeError)

### Root Cause Analysis

The source code shows the exception handling block:

```python
try:
    new_value = int(value)
    assert new_value == value
except (TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError) as err:
    raise TypeError(f"Wrong type {type(value)} for value {value}") from err
```

The code catches:
- `TypeError` - for truly incompatible types
- `ValueError` - for NaN conversions
- `AssertionError` - for floats that don't equal their int conversion

But it does NOT catch:
- `OverflowError` - raised by Python's int() for infinity values

### Technical Correctness of Bug Report

The bug report is technically correct in all aspects:
1. The reproduction code runs and demonstrates the issue
2. The root cause analysis is accurate
3. The proposed fix (adding OverflowError to the except clause) would resolve the issue
4. The docstring contract is clearly violated by the current behavior
