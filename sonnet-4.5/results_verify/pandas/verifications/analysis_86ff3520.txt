TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID (Not a bug):
Arguments AGAINST INVALID:
- The hash function violates the fundamental invariant: if a == b, then hash(a) == hash(b)
- 0.0 and -0.0 are equal according to IEEE 754, numpy, and Python
- Python's built-in hash() correctly handles this case
- This causes real bugs in groupby, deduplication, and joins

Arguments FOR INVALID:
- None. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
Arguments AGAINST WONTFIX:
- This is not an obscure edge case - signed zeros can occur naturally in calculations
- The bug causes incorrect results in core pandas operations (groupby, joins)
- The fix is straightforward and low-risk
- Other major systems (Python, Java, etc.) handle this correctly

Arguments FOR WONTFIX:
- Signed zeros are relatively uncommon in typical data analysis
- Some users might not encounter this issue
However, the potential for silent data corruption makes this non-trivial.

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality):
Arguments AGAINST FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is not requesting new functionality
- Hash functions maintaining the equality invariant is a fundamental requirement
- The current behavior is broken, not missing

Arguments FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
- None. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding features.

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation error):
Arguments AGAINST DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- Even without explicit documentation, hash invariants are universally expected
- Documenting that "equal values might have different hashes" would be absurd

Arguments FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise the hash invariant
However, this is such a fundamental expectation that it doesn't need documentation.

5. BUG (Valid bug report):
Arguments FOR BUG:
- Violates the fundamental hash invariant
- Causes incorrect results in groupby, deduplication, and joins
- Inconsistent with Python's hash(), numpy equality, and IEEE 754
- The bug is reproducible and well-documented
- The impact is real and can cause data corruption
- A clear fix is available

Arguments AGAINST BUG:
- None identified.

CONCLUSION:
This is unequivocally a BUG. The hash_array function violates the fundamental mathematical property that equal values must have equal hashes. This can cause silent data corruption in pandas operations, making it a serious issue that should be fixed.
