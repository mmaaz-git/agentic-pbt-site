## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Arguments For:**
- The function name "capitalize_first_letter" reasonably implies it will capitalize one letter, not expand it to multiple letters
- Length-changing behavior is surprising and could break downstream code that assumes string length is preserved
- The bug report correctly identifies the technical issue and its cause
- The behavior is inconsistent - works as expected for ASCII but not for certain Unicode characters

**Arguments Against:**
- The function has no documentation claiming it preserves length
- The behavior is correct according to Unicode standards (ß → SS is the correct uppercase mapping)
- Python's str.upper() is working as designed per Unicode specification

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The function has no documentation, so there's no specification being violated
- The implementation correctly uses Python's standard str.upper() which follows Unicode standards
- The Unicode standard explicitly defines these character expansions as correct behavior
- The function never promises to preserve string length

**Arguments Against:**
- The function name strongly suggests single-character operation
- Most users would reasonably expect length preservation when "capitalizing" a string
- The lack of documentation doesn't excuse counterintuitive behavior

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- The affected characters (ß, ﬁ, ﬂ) are relatively obscure and rarely used
- This is standard Unicode behavior that occurs throughout Python
- Fixing this would require deviating from standard Unicode case mapping
- The issue only affects a tiny subset of possible inputs

**Arguments Against:**
- German is a major language where ß is common
- The fix is simple (could use str.capitalize() or handle expansions specially)
- String length changes can cause real bugs in production code

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The function completely lacks documentation
- Adding a docstring warning about Unicode expansion would help users
- The code works correctly per Unicode standards; users just need to be warned
- The function name is ambiguous and needs clarification

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug report claims this is a logic bug, not a documentation issue
- Simply documenting bad behavior doesn't make it acceptable

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be reframed as requesting a new parameter like "preserve_length=True"
- The current behavior follows standards; different behavior would be a new feature

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug report presents this as a defect, not a missing feature
- Most users would expect length preservation by default

### Conclusion
This is a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** issue. The function behaves correctly according to Unicode standards, but its complete lack of documentation combined with an ambiguous name creates reasonable but incorrect user expectations. The function needs a docstring that:
1. Explains it uppercases the first character using Unicode rules
2. Warns that certain characters (ß, ﬁ, ﬂ, etc.) may expand to multiple characters
3. Clarifies that string length is not necessarily preserved
4. Suggests alternatives if length preservation is required

The code itself is working as intended per Unicode specifications, but users cannot know this without documentation.
