## Documentation Analysis for FixedForwardWindowIndexer

### Official Documentation Review:

1. **Class Purpose**:
   - Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row
   - Designed for forward-looking rolling calculations

2. **Window Size Parameter**:
   - Type annotation shows `window_size: int = 0`
   - No explicit documentation stating window_size must be non-negative
   - No validation in BaseIndexer.__init__ or FixedForwardWindowIndexer.__init__
   - Examples only show positive values (e.g., window_size=2)

3. **get_window_bounds Implementation**:
   - Source code reveals the logic: `end = start + self.window_size`
   - When window_size is negative, this produces end < start
   - The clipping operation `np.clip(end, 0, num_values)` doesn't fix the invalid bounds
   - No validation to prevent negative window sizes

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Documentation states it returns "A tuple of ndarray[int64]s, indicating the boundaries of each window"
   - No explicit documentation about the relationship between start and end bounds
   - However, the concept of "window boundaries" inherently implies valid ranges

5. **Similar Classes**:
   - Other indexer classes don't explicitly document window_size constraints
   - The general pandas rolling window documentation doesn't address negative window sizes

### Key Findings:

1. **No Explicit Constraint Documentation**: The documentation does not explicitly state that window_size must be non-negative.

2. **Implicit Expectations**:
   - All examples use positive window sizes
   - The concept of a "window" implies a valid range where start <= end
   - Forward-looking windows conceptually cannot have negative sizes

3. **Implementation Oversight**: The code doesn't validate input, allowing negative values that break the fundamental invariant of window boundaries.

### Conclusion:

While the documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit negative window sizes, the semantic meaning of "window boundaries" and "forward-looking windows" implies that:
1. Windows should have valid bounds (start <= end)
2. A forward-looking window with negative size is semantically nonsensical
3. The implementation should enforce these constraints even if not explicitly documented

The bug represents a case where the implementation allows input that violates the fundamental semantics of the operation, even though the documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit it.
