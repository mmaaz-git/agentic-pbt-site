BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

REPRODUCTION STATUS: CONFIRMED - The bug is reproducible and behaves exactly as reported.

TEST RESULTS SUMMARY:
All test cases from the bug report were successfully reproduced, confirming that length_of_indexer returns negative values for slices with negative steps.

DETAILED TEST RESULTS:

1. slice(None, None, -1) with target_len=1:
   - Function returns: -1
   - Expected/Actual: 1
   - The function returns a negative length for a valid reverse slice

2. slice(None, None, -1) with target_len=5:
   - Function returns: -5
   - Expected/Actual: 5
   - Returns negative of the actual length for full reverse slice

3. slice(None, None, -2) with target_len=4:
   - Function returns: -2
   - Expected/Actual: 2
   - Returns negative value for reverse slice with step -2

4. slice(5, None, -1) with target_len=7:
   - Function returns: -2
   - Expected/Actual: 6
   - Incorrect calculation, not even the negative of the actual length

5. slice(None, 2, -1) with target_len=6:
   - Function returns: -2
   - Expected/Actual: 3
   - Another incorrect negative value

HYPOTHESIS TEST:
The hypothesis test immediately failed on the first example, confirming systematic issues with negative step handling.

PYTHON STANDARD BEHAVIOR:
Testing Python's built-in slice.indices() method shows:
- It correctly handles all negative step cases
- len(range(*slice.indices(target_len))) always returns the correct non-negative length
- This is the standard, well-tested approach for computing slice lengths

ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION:
The bug occurs in the manual slice normalization logic at lines 313-316 of the source:
```python
elif step < 0:
    start, stop = stop + 1, start + 1
    step = -step
return (stop - start + step - 1) // step
```

This logic incorrectly handles negative steps by:
1. Swapping and adjusting start/stop values incorrectly
2. Negating the step but not properly adjusting the formula
3. Resulting in negative values when stop < start after the swap

PROPOSED FIX VALIDATION:
The proposed fix using `len(range(*indexer.indices(len(target))))`:
- Correctly returns non-negative lengths for all test cases
- Matches the actual behavior of Python slicing
- Replaces 18 lines of buggy code with 1 line of correct code
- Leverages Python's well-tested slice handling

CONCLUSION:
The bug is 100% reproducible and behaves exactly as described in the report. The function returns negative lengths for slices with negative steps, violating the fundamental invariant that lengths must be non-negative.
