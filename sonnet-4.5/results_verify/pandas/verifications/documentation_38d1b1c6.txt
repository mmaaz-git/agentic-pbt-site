## Documentation Analysis for PyperclipWindowsException

Based on my review of the official pandas documentation and source code, here are my findings:

### Official Documentation
The pandas documentation states that `PyperclipWindowsException` is:
- "Exception raised when clipboard functionality is unsupported by Windows."
- "Access to the clipboard handle would be denied due to some other window process is accessing it."

### Key Findings

1. **Class Purpose**: The exception is specifically designed for Windows-specific clipboard access issues, particularly when multiple applications compete for clipboard access.

2. **Parent Class**: Inherits from `PyperclipException`, which is itself described as "Exception raised when clipboard functionality is unsupported."

3. **Usage Context**: Raised by `to_clipboard()` and `read_clipboard()` methods when clipboard operations fail on Windows.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The source code at line 637 shows: `message += f" ({ctypes.WinError()})"`
   - There's a comment at line 636: "# attr only exists on Windows, so typing fails on other platforms"
   - The comment acknowledges that `WinError` only exists on Windows

5. **Platform Specificity**:
   - The name clearly indicates this is Windows-specific ("PyperclipWindowsException")
   - The docstring specifically mentions "Windows"
   - The implementation uses `ctypes.WinError()` which is Windows-only

### Critical Observation
The documentation does NOT specify:
- Whether this exception class should be instantiable on non-Windows platforms
- What the expected behavior should be when importing or instantiating this exception on Linux/macOS
- Whether the exception is meant to be caught or referenced in cross-platform code

The documentation focuses only on when the exception is raised (on Windows when clipboard access fails), not on the exception's instantiation behavior across platforms. There's no explicit statement that the exception should only be instantiated on Windows or that it should handle cross-platform instantiation gracefully.
