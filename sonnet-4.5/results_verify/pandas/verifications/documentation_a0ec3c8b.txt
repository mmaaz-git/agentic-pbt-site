## Documentation Analysis for hash_array

### Function Signature and Documentation
The `hash_array` function is defined in `pandas.core.util.hashing` with the following signature:
```python
def hash_array(vals: ArrayLike, encoding: str = "utf8", hash_key: str = _default_hash_key, categorize: bool = True) -> npt.NDArray[np.uint64]
```

### Documentation for the categorize Parameter
According to the docstring (line 249-251 in the source code):
> "categorize : bool, default True
>     Whether to first categorize object arrays before hashing. This is more
>     efficient when the array contains duplicate values."

The official pandas documentation at pandas.pydata.org states the same thing - that categorize is for efficiency when dealing with duplicate values.

### Key Observations from Documentation:
1. **No specification of behavior consistency**: The documentation does NOT specify that `categorize=True` and `categorize=False` should produce the same hash values. The parameter is only described as a performance optimization.

2. **Performance optimization claim**: The documentation only claims that using `categorize=True` is "more efficient" for arrays with duplicate values. It does not make any guarantees about the hash values themselves.

3. **No mention of string handling**: Neither the docstring nor the official documentation mentions any special handling of strings with null characters or how `factorize` might treat them.

4. **Implementation detail not documented**: The fact that `categorize=True` uses `pandas.factorize()` internally (line 318) is an implementation detail not mentioned in the public documentation.

5. **factorize behavior**: The pandas.factorize() documentation does not specify how it handles strings with null characters. The observed behavior where strings ending with null characters are treated identically to the same string without the null character appears to be undocumented behavior.

### Conclusion from Documentation
The documentation does not explicitly state that `categorize=True` and `categorize=False` should produce identical hash values. It only describes the parameter as a performance optimization. Therefore, the bug report's assumption that these should produce identical results is not supported by the documentation.
