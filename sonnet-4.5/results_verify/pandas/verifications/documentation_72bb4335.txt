## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **pandas.read_json Documentation**:
   - The `convert_axes` parameter is documented as: "Try to convert the axes to the proper dtypes"
   - Default value: "For all orient values except 'table', default is True"
   - This means by default, pandas WILL attempt to convert column names to what it considers "proper dtypes"

2. **pandas.DataFrame.to_json Documentation**:
   - In 'split' orient, the format is: `{'index': [index], 'columns': [columns], 'data': [values]}`
   - Columns are explicitly stored as an array
   - The documentation states that 'split' orient "allows for the preservation of metadata"

3. **Round-Trip Behavior Documentation**:
   - The user guide mentions: "If you wish to preserve label ordering use the split option as it uses ordered containers"
   - However, there is NO explicit documentation warning about type conversion of column names
   - The documentation does not state that numeric string columns will be converted to integers

4. **Key Documentation Gaps**:
   - No warning that string column names like '00' will lose leading zeros
   - No explicit statement that round-trip with default settings may not preserve column name types
   - No mention that all-numeric string columns are treated differently from mixed columns
   - The phrase "proper dtypes" for convert_axes is vague and doesn't specify the conversion rules

5. **Implicit Expectations**:
   - Users would reasonably expect DataFrame.to_json() followed by pd.read_json() to preserve their data
   - The documentation for 'split' orient suggests it preserves structure, but doesn't warn about type changes
   - The fact that convert_axes=False exists suggests this conversion is intentional, but it's not clearly documented

### Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly specify that numeric string column names will be converted to integers during JSON round-trips. While the convert_axes parameter's existence and default value (True) suggest some conversion will occur, the documentation fails to warn users about potential data loss (e.g., '00' â†’ 0) or the inconsistent behavior between all-numeric and mixed column sets. This creates a reasonable expectation that round-trip operations should preserve column names as-is.
