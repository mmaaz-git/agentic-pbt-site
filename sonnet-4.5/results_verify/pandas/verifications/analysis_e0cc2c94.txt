TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for Each Category

### 1. INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None. The function clearly violates its documented contract.

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The function name "is_re_compilable" is a boolean predicate that should return True/False
- The documentation explicitly promises a bool return type with no exceptions mentioned
- The function currently raises PatternError for invalid regex strings, contradicting the documentation
- The behavior is inconsistent: returns False for integers but raises for invalid regex strings

### 2. WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- One could argue that users should validate their regex patterns before calling this function
- The error provides more information than a simple False return

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - invalid regex patterns are common in user input
- The function's entire purpose is to check "if" something can be compiled, not to actually compile it
- The inconsistent behavior (returning False for some invalid inputs, raising for others) is problematic
- This affects the function's usability in try/except-free code paths

### 3. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue the current behavior is "working as intended" and adding support for invalid regex is a new feature

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The documentation already promises this behavior - it says it returns bool for whether obj "can be compiled"
- The function name strongly implies it should handle all cases without raising exceptions
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to mention that PatternError is raised for invalid patterns
- The examples could be expanded to show this behavior

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The function name "is_re_compilable" strongly implies a boolean predicate that shouldn't raise
- Changing the documentation would make the function less useful and inconsistent with Python conventions
- The current behavior defeats the purpose of having a separate validation function
- Users would need try/except blocks, making the function no better than calling re.compile directly

### 5. BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
- The function violates its documented contract of returning a bool in all cases
- The function name follows Python's is_XXX convention for boolean predicates
- The behavior is inconsistent: returns False for non-strings but raises for invalid regex strings
- The documentation says it checks "whether obj can be compiled" - invalid patterns cannot be compiled, so should return False
- The current implementation only catches TypeError but not PatternError, which appears to be an oversight
- The fix is simple and makes the function behavior consistent with its documented purpose
- This breaks user code that expects a boolean return value as documented

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function fails to fulfill its documented contract as a boolean predicate function. It should return False for any object that cannot be compiled as a regex pattern, whether that's because it's not a string (TypeError) or because it's an invalid regex pattern (PatternError). The current behavior of raising PatternError contradicts both the documentation and the expected behavior implied by the function's name.
