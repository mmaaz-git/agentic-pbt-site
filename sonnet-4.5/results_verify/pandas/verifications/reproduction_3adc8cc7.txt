## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
I successfully reproduced the reported bug about pandas DataFrame transpose losing dtype information on mixed-type DataFrames.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - Ran the provided property-based test
   - Test failed as expected with AssertionError on n_rows=1, n_cols=2
   - Confirmed that int64 columns become float64 after double transpose

2. **Simple Example Test**:
   - Created DataFrame with {'a': [1.5], 'b': [2]}
   - Original dtypes: a=float64, b=int64
   - After df.T.T: Both columns become float64
   - The int64 dtype is lost, converted to float64

3. **Additional Testing**:
   - Tested various mixed-type scenarios:
     * int + string → converts to object dtype (preserves as object)
     * int + float → converts to float64 (loses int64)
     * Multiple mixed int/float columns → all become float64

### Key Findings

The bug is CONFIRMED. The behavior is as follows:
- When transposing a DataFrame with mixed numeric types (int64 and float64), pandas coerces all values to float64
- The first transpose (df.T) converts mixed int/float columns to float64
- The second transpose (df.T.T) maintains float64, not restoring the original int64
- This violates the mathematical property that transpose should be self-inverse: (M^T)^T = M

### Impact
The bug causes silent data type conversion, which can lead to:
- Loss of integer precision for large integers
- Unexpected behavior in downstream operations expecting integer types
- Violation of the principle that df.T.T should equal df exactly
