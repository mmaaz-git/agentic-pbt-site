# Documentation Analysis

## Official pandas.api.interchange Documentation

The function `from_dataframe()` documentation states:
- Purpose: "Build a pd.DataFrame from any DataFrame supporting the interchange protocol"
- The example explicitly shows the pattern: `interchange.from_dataframe(df.__dataframe__())`
- The function should accept any DataFrame supporting the interchange protocol
- No specific limitations on string content are mentioned

## Dataframe Interchange Protocol Specification

From the official specification at data-apis.org:
1. Strings are defined as `DtypeKind.STRING = 21  # UTF-8`
2. The protocol specifies strings must be "UTF-8 encoded"
3. No additional details about Unicode handling or surrogate character restrictions

## UTF-8 Standard (RFC 3629)

According to the UTF-8 specification:
- Since RFC 3629 (November 2003), surrogate characters (U+D800-U+DFFF) are NOT valid in UTF-8
- These code points must be treated as invalid byte sequences
- The standard explicitly forbids encoding surrogates in UTF-8

## Key Documentation Findings

1. **Specification Conflict**: The interchange protocol requires UTF-8 encoding but doesn't specify how to handle invalid UTF-8 sequences like surrogates

2. **pandas Behavior**: pandas DataFrames can store surrogate characters in string columns without issue, creating a mismatch between what pandas allows and what UTF-8 encoding supports

3. **No Documented Restrictions**: Neither the pandas documentation nor the interchange protocol documentation mentions restrictions on string content or handling of problematic Unicode sequences

4. **Implementation Detail**: The code directly calls `str.encode('utf-8')` without error handling, which is correct per UTF-8 spec but incompatible with pandas' permissive string handling

## Conclusion

The documentation lacks clarity on edge cases. While the interchange protocol specifies UTF-8 encoding (which by standard excludes surrogates), it doesn't address how to handle data that violates this constraint. The pandas implementation allows surrogates in DataFrames but crashes when converting them through the interchange protocol, revealing an undocumented limitation.
