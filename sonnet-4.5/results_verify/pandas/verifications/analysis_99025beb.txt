## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considerations for BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong arguments:**
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: Empty string "" raises ValueError, but " " returns None - this is clearly inconsistent
2. **Violates documented contract**: The docstring for _check_expression says it should "Make sure an expression is not an empty string" - whitespace-only strings are semantically empty expressions
3. **Unexpected return value**: Returning None for invalid input is surprising - users expect either a valid result or an exception
4. **No valid use case**: There's no reasonable scenario where pd.eval(" ") should return None instead of raising an error
5. **Bug is reproducible**: All reproduction tests confirm the issue
6. **Clear fix available**: The proposed fix is simple and correct

**This appears to be a VALID BUG**

### Considerations for INVALID
**Weak arguments:**
1. The documentation literally says "empty string" not "whitespace string" - but this is overly pedantic
2. The current implementation checks truthiness (`if not expr`) which is a valid Python pattern - but doesn't match intent
3. No existing tests rely on the current behavior of returning None for whitespace

**Not INVALID - the behavior is clearly wrong**

### Considerations for WONTFIX
**Arguments:**
1. This is a low-severity issue that likely affects very few users
2. The current behavior has existed for a while without major complaints
3. Changing it could potentially break existing code that depends on this behavior

**Could be WONTFIX if considered too minor, but the inconsistency is problematic**

### Considerations for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments:**
1. The documentation could be updated to say "raises ValueError for empty strings but returns None for whitespace-only strings"
2. Could document that only truly empty strings raise errors

**Not appropriate - the current behavior is illogical and should be fixed, not documented**

### Considerations for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments:**
1. Could argue that checking for whitespace-only strings is a new feature
2. The original implementation never intended to handle this case

**Not a FEATURE_REQUEST - this is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality**

### Final Assessment
This is a **BUG** because:

1. **Clear inconsistency**: The function treats "" and " " differently when they're semantically equivalent for expression evaluation
2. **Violates stated purpose**: The docstring says the function ensures expressions aren't empty, and whitespace-only strings contain no expression
3. **Unexpected None return**: Silently returning None instead of raising an error violates the principle of failing fast and clearly
4. **Simple, obvious fix**: The proposed fix (`if not expr or not expr.strip()`) is straightforward and correct
5. **No valid use case**: There's no reasonable scenario where the current behavior is desirable

The only reason to consider WONTFIX would be if this is deemed too trivial, but the inconsistency in behavior and violation of the documented contract make it a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
