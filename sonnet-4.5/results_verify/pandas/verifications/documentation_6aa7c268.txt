## Documentation Analysis Report

### Function Documentation
The `maybe_infer_ndim` function has minimal documentation:
```python
def maybe_infer_ndim(values, placement: BlockPlacement, ndim: int | None) -> int:
    """
    If `ndim` is not provided, infer it from placement and values.
    """
```

The documentation does not specify:
- What valid values for ndim should be
- Any constraints on the return value
- The expected behavior for different input types

### Module-Level Documentation
The api.py module is described as:
```
This is a pseudo-public API for downstream libraries. We ask that downstream
authors
1) Try to avoid using internals directly altogether, and failing that,
2) Use only functions exposed here (or in core.internals)
```

This indicates that `maybe_infer_ndim` is part of a semi-public API intended for downstream library use.

### Architectural Constraints Found in Code
Through code inspection, the following constraints are clear:
1. `BlockManager` has `ndim = 2` (always for DataFrames)
2. `SingleBlockManager` has `ndim = 1` (always for Series)
3. The BlockManager constructor validates: "Number of Block dimensions must equal number of axes"
4. Blocks in pandas must be either 1D or 2D

### Related Function Documentation
The `make_block` function (which calls `maybe_infer_ndim`) states:
```
This is a pseudo-public analogue to blocks.new_block.
We ask that downstream libraries use this rather than any fully-internal APIs
```

### Pandas Architecture Documentation
From web search results and code inspection:
- pandas uses a BlockManager architecture where data is stored in blocks
- Each block contains homogeneous dtype data
- Blocks are either 1D (for Series) or 2D (for DataFrames)
- The BlockManager validates that block dimensions match the manager's dimensions

### Documentation Gap
The documentation for `maybe_infer_ndim` does not explicitly state that:
1. The function should only return 1 or 2
2. These are the only valid ndim values for pandas Blocks
3. Other values will cause failures downstream

However, the architectural constraint is clear from:
- The BlockManager implementation
- The check_ndim validation function
- The fact that pandas only has 1D (Series) and 2D (DataFrame) data structures

### Conclusion
While the `maybe_infer_ndim` function itself lacks explicit documentation about valid ndim values, the pandas architecture clearly requires blocks to be 1D or 2D. The function is part of a pseudo-public API and should validate its outputs to prevent downstream errors.
