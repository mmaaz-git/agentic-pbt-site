## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed as follows:

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis test**: The property-based test correctly identifies that `get_version()` returns non-string values when a module's `__version__` attribute is not a string. The test fails with `version_value=0` (integer) and other non-string types.

2. **Direct reproduction**: When creating a mock module with `__version__ = 0`, the function returns the integer `0` directly, not a string:
   - Result: 0
   - Type: <class 'int'>

3. **psycopg2 specific crash**: When testing with a module named "psycopg2" and a non-string `__version__`, the function crashes with `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'split'` at line 81, exactly as the bug report predicted.

### Impact:

The bug has two main impacts:
1. **Type contract violation**: The function signature declares `-> str` but returns non-string values, violating the type annotation contract.
2. **Runtime crashes**: For modules named "psycopg2", non-string versions cause an immediate AttributeError when trying to call `.split()` on line 81.

The bug report's description and reproduction steps are completely accurate.
