## Documentation Analysis for pandas diff() methods

Based on the official pandas documentation:

### DataFrame.diff() and Series.diff()
- The documentation explicitly states: "dtype of the result is always float64"
- This is done to ensure consistent handling across different input types and to prevent potential integer overflow
- The method calculates discrete differences between elements
- For numeric types, it uses subtraction
- The result is always converted to float64 regardless of input dtype

### DataFrameGroupBy.diff() and SeriesGroupBy.diff()
- Calculates differences within each group separately
- Returns NaN for the first element of each group
- No specific documentation about how it handles data type conversion differently from ungrouped diff()
- No explicit statement that grouped and ungrouped diff() should produce identical results for the same data

### Key Documentation Findings:
1. **Float64 conversion is documented**: The documentation clearly states that diff() always returns float64
2. **No consistency guarantee**: The documentation does NOT explicitly state that grouped and ungrouped diff() must produce identical results
3. **No precision loss warnings**: The documentation does not warn about potential precision loss for large integers beyond 2^53
4. **Implementation details not specified**: The documentation does not specify whether conversion to float64 happens before or after the subtraction

### What the documentation does NOT say:
- It does not guarantee that `df.groupby('group')['value'].diff()` will produce identical results to `df['value'].diff()` when there's only one group
- It does not specify the order of operations (convert then subtract vs. subtract then convert)
- It does not warn users about potential precision differences for large integers
- It does not document any expected behavior difference between grouped and ungrouped operations regarding numeric precision
