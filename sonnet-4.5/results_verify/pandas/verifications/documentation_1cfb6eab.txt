## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **PyPerclip Documentation (pyperclip.readthedocs.io):**
   - Mentions that waitForPaste() and waitForNewPaste() accept a timeout parameter
   - States that PyperclipTimeoutException is raised if timeout elapses
   - Only provides example with positive timeout (5 seconds)
   - **Does NOT specify behavior for timeout=0 or negative values**
   - **Does NOT specify timing precision or minimum wait times**

2. **Function Docstrings (from source code):**
   ```
   waitForPaste: "This function raises PyperclipTimeoutException if timeout was set to
   a number of seconds that has elapsed without non-empty text being put on
   the clipboard."

   waitForNewPaste: "This function raises PyperclipTimeoutException if timeout was set to
   a number of seconds that has elapsed without non-empty text being put on
   the clipboard."
   ```
   - Uses phrase "a number of seconds that has elapsed"
   - **Does NOT specify behavior for timeout=0 or negative values**
   - **Does NOT specify timing precision or polling interval**
   - **Does NOT mention the 0.01s sleep between checks**

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **Unspecified behavior for edge cases:**
   - What should happen with timeout=0?
   - What should happen with negative timeouts?
   - What is the expected timing precision?

2. **Hidden implementation details:**
   - The 10ms (0.01s) polling interval is not documented
   - The fact that timeout check happens AFTER the first sleep is not documented
   - Minimum effective timeout of ~0.01s is not documented

### Reasonable User Expectations

Based on common programming patterns and similar timeout implementations:

1. **timeout=0** typically means:
   - Check once and return immediately if condition not met
   - Or timeout immediately without any wait
   - Common in polling/async functions (e.g., select() with timeout=0)

2. **Negative timeouts** typically:
   - Are either invalid (should raise error)
   - Or treated as 0 (immediate timeout)
   - Or mean "wait forever" (though None is used for that here)

3. **Timing precision:**
   - Users expect timeouts to be respected within reasonable precision
   - A function that can't timeout faster than 10ms should document this limitation
   - Users setting timeout=0.001 (1ms) reasonably expect ~1ms timeout, not 10ms

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly define the expected behavior for timeoutâ‰¤0 or specify timing precision. However, the current implementation violates reasonable user expectations by:
1. Always waiting at least 10ms regardless of timeout value
2. Not documenting this minimum wait time
3. Accepting but ignoring the precision of small timeout values

This could be considered either:
- A BUG: The implementation doesn't match reasonable expectations
- A DOCUMENTATION_FIX: The limitations should be documented
