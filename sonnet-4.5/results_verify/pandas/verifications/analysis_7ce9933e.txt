## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
- The method crashes with RecursionError on valid input data
- The crash occurs on the simplest possible case: `SparseArray([1])`
- The method name "cumsum" clearly indicates it should compute cumulative sums
- NumPy's cumsum works fine on the same data: `np.cumsum([1, 0, 0, 2])` returns `[1, 1, 1, 3]`
- The documentation promises "Cumulative sum" functionality but delivers a crash
- The bug affects the most common use case (integer arrays with fill_value=0)
- The proposed fix is simple and correct: change `SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()` to `SparseArray(self.to_dense().cumsum())`
- The infinite recursion is clearly unintended - no reasonable implementation would intentionally recurse infinitely

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
- None. The bug report is accurate and verifiable.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug is reproducible
- The analysis is correct about the infinite recursion
- The proposed fix addresses the root cause

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
- None. This is not an obscure edge case.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This affects all SparseArrays with non-null fill values, which is the majority use case
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- cumsum is a fundamental operation that users expect to work
- The bug makes the method completely unusable for integer data

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be clearer about the wording "non-NA/null values will be skipped"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code doesn't work at all - it's not a documentation issue
- Even if documentation said "only works with NaN fill values", that would be a severe limitation that should be fixed
- The documentation promises cumsum functionality, the code should deliver it

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- None. cumsum is already supposed to be implemented.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The method exists and is documented
- It's supposed to work but has a bug
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new features

### Technical Analysis

The bug is in line 1550 of the implementation:
```python
if not self._null_fill_value:
    return SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()
```

This creates infinite recursion because:
1. `self.to_dense()` returns a numpy array
2. `SparseArray(numpy_array)` creates a new SparseArray with the same fill_value
3. The new SparseArray still has `_null_fill_value=False`
4. It calls cumsum() again, repeating the cycle

The correct implementation should be:
```python
if not self._null_fill_value:
    return SparseArray(self.to_dense().cumsum())
```

This calls cumsum() on the numpy array first, then wraps the result.

### Severity Assessment

- **Impact**: High - Complete failure of a documented method
- **Scope**: Wide - Affects all integer/float SparseArrays (the most common types)
- **Workaround**: Users must manually convert to dense, compute cumsum, then convert back
- **Fix Complexity**: Trivial - One line change

### Conclusion

This is unquestionably a **BUG**. The cumsum() method is documented, expected to work, and fails catastrophically on valid input due to a simple coding error. The infinite recursion is clearly unintended, and the fix is straightforward and correct.
