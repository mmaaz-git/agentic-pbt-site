Bug Reproduction Results
========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue manifests when DataFrames containing rows with all empty strings or None values are round-tripped through Excel using pandas.

Test Results:
-------------

1. Property-Based Test with data=[(0, 0.0, '')]:
   - Original DataFrame: 1 row with values [0, 0.0, '']
   - After round-trip: 1 row with values [0, 0, NaN]
   - Issue: Empty string converted to NaN, but row not lost in this case

2. Manual Test 1 - Single column with empty string:
   - Original DataFrame: 1 row with {'text': ''}
   - After round-trip with na_filter=False: 0 rows (Empty DataFrame)
   - **ROW COMPLETELY LOST**

3. Manual Test 2 - Single column with None:
   - Original DataFrame: 1 row with {'col': None}
   - After round-trip: 0 rows (Empty DataFrame)
   - **ROW COMPLETELY LOST**

4. Manual Test 3 - Multiple columns, all empty/None:
   - Original DataFrame: 1 row with {'col1': '', 'col2': None, 'col3': ''}
   - After round-trip: 0 rows (Empty DataFrame)
   - **ROW COMPLETELY LOST**

5. Manual Test 4 - Mixed data (one empty row, one with data):
   - Original DataFrame: 2 rows
   - After round-trip: 2 rows preserved
   - First row (all empty/None) preserved when other rows have data

Key Findings:
-------------
1. When a DataFrame has a single row with all cells containing empty strings or None values, that row disappears entirely after round-tripping through Excel.

2. When a DataFrame has multiple rows where at least one row has non-empty data, the empty rows are preserved (though empty strings become empty cells/NaN).

3. The behavior is inconsistent: empty rows are lost when they're the only rows, but preserved when mixed with non-empty rows.

4. Using na_filter=False during read_excel does not prevent the row loss.

This confirms the bug report's claim that rows with all empty/None values can disappear during Excel round-trips, violating data preservation expectations.
