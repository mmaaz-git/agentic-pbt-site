REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

1. BUG CONFIRMATION:
   When AbstractMethodError is created with methodtype="classmethod" and an instance object
   (rather than a class), calling str() on the error raises an AttributeError.

   Error: AttributeError: 'DummyClass' object has no attribute '__name__'

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
   The property-based test using Hypothesis confirmed that:
   - methodtype="method" works fine with an instance
   - methodtype="staticmethod" works fine with an instance
   - methodtype="property" works fine with an instance
   - methodtype="classmethod" FAILS with an instance (AttributeError)

3. ROOT CAUSE:
   The __str__ method in pandas/errors/__init__.py:304-305 assumes that when
   methodtype == "classmethod", the class_instance will be a class object (which has __name__).
   However, the __init__ method accepts any object as class_instance without validation.

4. EXPECTED VS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
   - Expected: AbstractMethodError should either accept an instance and handle it gracefully,
     or validate that classmethods must receive a class
   - Actual: Code crashes with AttributeError when an instance is passed with methodtype="classmethod"

5. VERIFICATION WITH CORRECT USAGE:
   When passing a class (not instance) with methodtype="classmethod", it works correctly:
   - pd_errors.AbstractMethodError(DummyClass, methodtype="classmethod") works
   - pd_errors.AbstractMethodError(DummyClass(), methodtype="classmethod") fails

The bug is real and reproducible.
