## Bug Report Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The behavior is inconsistent: complex128 uses the formula `hash(real) + 23 * hash(imag)` while complex64 does not
- This violates the principle of consistency - the same logical data type (complex numbers) should be hashed using the same algorithm regardless of precision
- The proposed fix is simple and logical: change the check from `np.complex128` to `np.complexfloating` to handle all complex types consistently
- This is likely an oversight rather than intentional design, given the comment suggests the special handling was added for size reasons (128-bit) rather than type reasons

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The comment explicitly states the special handling is for 128-bit values, suggesting the current behavior might be intentional
- Complex64 fits in 64 bits and can be hashed directly without splitting

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't specify that complex numbers of different precisions should hash the same way
- The code comment suggests the behavior is intentional for handling different bit sizes
- Complex numbers aren't mentioned in documentation as needing special consistency

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- There's a reasonable expectation of consistency for the same logical data type
- The inconsistency could cause issues in applications that mix complex64 and complex128
- The fix is straightforward and improves consistency

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- This is a relatively obscure edge case that may not affect many users
- Changing hash behavior could break existing code that depends on current hashes
- Complex64 and complex128 are different types, so different hashes might be acceptable

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The issue affects a fundamental operation (hashing) on a standard numeric type
- The inconsistency is surprising and could lead to subtle bugs
- Pandas generally aims for consistency across numeric types

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current behavior could be considered correct if properly documented
- Documentation could clarify that different complex precisions hash differently
- This preserves backward compatibility while making behavior explicit

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The behavior seems more like an implementation oversight than intentional design
- Documenting inconsistent behavior doesn't make it correct
- Users would reasonably expect consistency without needing documentation

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Consistent hashing across complex types could be seen as a new feature
- The current behavior technically works, just differently

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior rather than adding new functionality
- The hash_array function already handles complex numbers, just inconsistently

### Final Assessment
This is most appropriately categorized as a **BUG**. The key reasons:

1. **Logical inconsistency**: Complex numbers are a single logical data type that should be handled consistently regardless of precision
2. **Likely oversight**: The comment about "128-bit values" suggests the check was added for size reasons, but complex64 can and should use the same formula
3. **Simple fix with clear benefits**: Using `np.complexfloating` instead of `np.complex128` provides consistency without downsides
4. **Pandas philosophy**: Pandas generally aims for consistent behavior across numeric types and precisions
5. **Potential for subtle bugs**: Applications mixing complex64 and complex128 could experience unexpected behavior due to this inconsistency
