# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### deregister_matplotlib_converters() Documentation

The official docstring states:

> "Removes the custom converters added by :func:`register`. This attempts to set the state of the registry back to the state before pandas registered its own units."

Key promises made by the documentation:
1. It will remove custom converters added by register()
2. It will "attempt to set the state of the registry back to the state before pandas registered its own units"
3. Pandas-specific types (Timestamp, Period) are removed completely
4. Types that pandas overwrites (like datetime.datetime) are "restored to their original value"

### Critical Analysis

The documentation explicitly states that the function should:
- Restore the registry to the state BEFORE pandas registered its units
- Restore overwritten types to their "original value"

This is a clear contract that the function should act as an inverse operation to register(), at least in terms of restoring the previous state.

### Documentation vs. Implementation

The bug report demonstrates that this documented behavior is violated:
1. After multiple register/deregister cycles, the registry is NOT restored to its original state
2. datetime.datetime converters are NOT restored to their original value correctly
3. The function fails to be a true inverse of register() as promised

## Conclusion

The documentation clearly establishes that deregister() should restore the matplotlib registry to its pre-registration state. The bug report shows this promise is broken when multiple register/deregister cycles occur. This is not a case of undefined behavior or missing documentation - the documentation explicitly promises restoration behavior that the implementation fails to deliver.
