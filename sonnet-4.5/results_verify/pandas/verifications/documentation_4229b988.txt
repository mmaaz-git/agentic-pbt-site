## Documentation Analysis for ensure_python_int

### Function Documentation (Docstring)
The function `ensure_python_int` has a clear docstring that specifies its contract:

**Purpose**: "Ensure that a value is a python int."

**Parameters**:
- `value: int or numpy.integer`

**Returns**:
- `int`

**Raises**:
- `TypeError: if the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one.`

The critical part is the Raises section which explicitly states that the function should raise `TypeError` for values that aren't integers or can't be converted to integers.

### Code Analysis
Looking at the source code (lines 109-120):

1. Line 109: The function checks `if not (is_integer(value) or is_float(value))` - this means it accepts both integer and float types
2. Lines 110-114: If the value is neither integer nor float, it raises TypeError
3. Lines 115-120: The function attempts conversion with `int(value)` and catches `(TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError)` to re-raise as TypeError

### The Contract Gap
The documentation clearly states that the function should raise `TypeError` for any value that "isn't an int or can't be converted to one."

Key observations:
- `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` are valid float values that `is_float()` returns True for
- These infinity values cannot be converted to integers
- When Python's `int()` function receives infinity, it raises `OverflowError`
- The current exception handling only catches `(TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError)` but not `OverflowError`

### Documentation Interpretation
The documentation is unambiguous: ANY failure to convert to int should result in a `TypeError`. The phrase "can't be converted to one" covers all conversion failures, including:
- Type mismatches (TypeError from int())
- Invalid string formats (ValueError from int())
- Assertion failures for precision loss (AssertionError)
- **Overflow conditions (OverflowError from int())**

The documentation does not make any exception for overflow conditions or specify that OverflowError should be allowed to propagate. Users reading the documentation would reasonably expect that ALL conversion failures would result in TypeError.

### External Documentation
I searched for any external pandas documentation but the function appears to be an internal utility function not exposed in the public API documentation. The docstring is the authoritative documentation for this function.

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly specifies that `TypeError` should be raised for any value that can't be converted to an integer. The current implementation violates this contract by allowing `OverflowError` to escape when infinity values are passed. This is a clear discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual implementation.
