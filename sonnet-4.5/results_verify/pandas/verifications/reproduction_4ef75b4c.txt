## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. Here are the findings:

1. **Confirmed Bug Behavior**:
   - The function `make_flex_doc('div', 'series')` raises `KeyError: 'div'`
   - The function `make_flex_doc('div', 'dataframe')` also raises `KeyError: 'div'`
   - All other operations listed ('add', 'sub', 'mul', 'truediv', 'floordiv', 'mod', 'pow') work correctly

2. **Hypothesis Test Results**:
   - The hypothesis test fails as expected when it encounters `op_name='div'`
   - The test passes for all other operation names in the list

3. **Method Existence Verification**:
   - `Series.div` exists: True
   - `DataFrame.div` exists: True
   - The string 'div' appears in the DataFrame.div docstring as one of the flexible wrappers

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - In the source code, `div` is defined as an alias: `div = truediv` in both series.py and frame.py
   - However, `div` and `truediv` are not the same object (`s.div is s.truediv` returns False), likely due to how the methods are bound
   - The docstring for `div` methods actually refers to them as performing "truediv" operation

5. **Root Cause**:
   - The `_op_descriptions` dictionary in docstrings.py contains an entry for 'truediv' but not for 'div'
   - When `make_flex_doc('div', typ)` is called, it attempts to access `_op_descriptions['div']` which doesn't exist
   - The function does not have logic to handle aliases or fall back to the aliased operation

The bug report's technical details are accurate: the function raises a KeyError for 'div' despite 'div' being a documented and existing method on both Series and DataFrame.
