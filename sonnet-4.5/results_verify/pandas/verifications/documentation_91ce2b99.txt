DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS REPORT
==============================

1. PANDAS DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:

pandas.read_clipboard():
- The official documentation does NOT explicitly mention an encoding parameter
- It states that **kwargs are passed to read_csv()
- No specific encoding restrictions are documented

pandas.DataFrame.to_clipboard():
- The official documentation does NOT explicitly mention an encoding parameter
- It states that **kwargs are passed to to_csv()
- No specific encoding restrictions are documented

2. PYTHON ENCODING DOCUMENTATION:

According to Python's official documentation (codecs module):
- UTF-8 has multiple valid aliases: 'utf_8', 'U8', 'UTF', 'utf8', 'cp65001'
- Encoding names are case-insensitive
- Python normalizes these names internally

3. CODE COMMENTS VS DOCUMENTATION:

The code contains inline comments that state:
- Line 76-77: "only utf-8 is valid for passed value because that's what clipboard supports"
- Line 159: "testing if an invalid encoding is passed to clipboard"

However, these restrictions are NOT mentioned in the public API documentation.

4. ERROR MESSAGES:

The error messages say:
- "reading from clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding"
- "clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding"

These messages imply that ANY valid UTF-8 encoding name should work, not just specific variations.

CONCLUSION:
There is no documentation that specifies that only certain UTF-8 name variations are accepted. The error messages and code comments suggest UTF-8 is supported, but don't specify that only hyphenated versions work. This creates an inconsistency where valid Python UTF-8 encoding names are rejected.
