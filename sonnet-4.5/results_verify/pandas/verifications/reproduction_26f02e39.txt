Bug Reproduction Results

Test Execution Summary:
The bug report is technically correct. The code does count total whitespace characters instead of tabs.

Test Results:

1. Basic Reproduction Case with " \ta\tb\tc" (1 space + 1 tab):
   - Expected columns: ['a', 'b', 'c'] with shape (2, 3)
   - Actual columns: ['b', 'c'] with shape (2, 2)
   - Column 'a' was incorrectly treated as an index column

2. Property-Based Test Results:
   - 1 space + 1 tab: Expected 3 columns, got 2 ❌
   - 2 spaces + 1 tab: Expected 3 columns, got 1 ❌
   - 3 spaces + 1 tab: Expected 3 columns, got 0 ❌
   - 4 spaces + 1 tab: Test crashed with error (too many index columns)
   - 5 spaces + 1 tab: Test crashed with error (too many index columns)

3. Manual Test Cases:
   - " \ta\tb\tc" (1 space + 1 tab): Leading WS length=2, tabs in WS=1, columns=['b','c']
   - "  \ta\tb\tc" (2 spaces + 1 tab): Leading WS length=3, tabs in WS=1, columns=['c']
   - "\ta\tb\tc" (1 tab only): Leading WS length=1, tabs in WS=1, columns=['a','b','c'] ✓
   - "\t\ta\tb\tc" (2 tabs only): Leading WS length=2, tabs in WS=2, columns=['a','b','c'] ✓
   - "   \ta\tb\tc" (3 spaces + 1 tab): Leading WS length=4, tabs in WS=1, columns=[]

4. Code Analysis:
   Line 111: index_length = len(lines[0]) - len(lines[0].lstrip(" \t"))

   This calculates the total length of leading whitespace characters (spaces + tabs),
   not the count of tab characters. The comment at line 109-110 says "check the number
   of leading tabs" but the implementation counts all whitespace characters.

5. Bug Impact:
   - With spaces before tabs, the wrong number of columns become index columns
   - This breaks data parsing when clipboard content has spaces before tabs
   - The behavior contradicts the code comment's stated intent

Technical Verification:
The bug report's assertion is CORRECT. The code does count whitespace character length
instead of tab count, causing incorrect index column detection when spaces precede tabs.
