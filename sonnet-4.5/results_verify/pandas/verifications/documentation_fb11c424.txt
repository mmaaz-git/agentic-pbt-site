## Documentation Analysis for putmask_without_repeat

### Function Documentation (from source code)

The function's docstring at lines 65-74 clearly states:
```
np.putmask will truncate or repeat if `new` is a listlike with
len(new) != len(values).  We require an exact match.
```

This documentation is unambiguous: the function is designed to prevent repetition/truncation and requires an exact match between the number of values to be placed and the number of masked positions.

### Key Observations

1. **Clear Contract**: The documentation explicitly states "We require an exact match" - this means the function should NOT allow repetition of values when there's a length mismatch.

2. **Internal Function**: This is an internal pandas function (not part of the public API), used by pandas.core.internals.blocks. While it's internal, the documentation still establishes a clear contract.

3. **Misleading Code Comment**: The comment at lines 86-89 claims np.place behaves differently from np.putmask regarding repetition, but testing shows both functions actually repeat values. This misleading comment doesn't change the documented contract.

4. **Implementation vs Documentation**: The implementation at line 93 has a special case `shape[-1] == 1` that allows single-element arrays to be passed through to np.putmask, which will repeat the value. This directly contradicts the documented requirement for "an exact match."

### Conclusion

The documentation is clear and consistent about requiring an exact match and not allowing repetition. The bug is in the implementation, not the documentation. The special case for `shape[-1] == 1` violates the documented contract by allowing numpy's repetition behavior for single-element arrays.
