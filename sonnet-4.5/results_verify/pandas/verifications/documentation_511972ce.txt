DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. DOCSTRING EXAMINATION:
   The docstring in pandas/errors/__init__.py (lines 273-292) shows:

   Example usage:
   ```python
   class Foo:
       @classmethod
       def classmethod(cls):
           raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(cls, methodtype="classmethod")
       def method(self):
           raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(self)
   ```

   Key observation: The example shows that classmethods should pass 'cls' (the class itself),
   not 'self' (an instance).

2. PARAMETER DOCUMENTATION:
   The __init__ method signature shows:
   - class_instance: No type hint or explicit documentation about whether this should be
     a class or instance for different methodtypes
   - methodtype: str = "method" - Can be one of {"method", "classmethod", "staticmethod", "property"}

3. PANDAS OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
   The online documentation confirms the same pattern - classmethods are expected to pass
   the class (cls), not an instance (self).

4. IMPLICIT EXPECTATIONS:
   - The docstring examples clearly show that for @classmethod decorators, the cls parameter
     should be passed to AbstractMethodError
   - For regular methods, self (the instance) should be passed
   - The parameter name "class_instance" is ambiguous - it could mean either a class or
     an instance of a class

5. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
   - No explicit statement that class_instance MUST be a class when methodtype="classmethod"
   - No validation or type checking in the __init__ method
   - The parameter name "class_instance" is misleading as it accepts both classes and instances

CONCLUSION:
The documentation strongly implies through examples that classmethods should pass a class,
but this is not explicitly stated as a requirement, nor is it enforced by the code.
