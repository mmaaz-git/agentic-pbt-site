# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### pandas.api.extensions.register_extension_dtype
The official pandas documentation states:
- Purpose: "Register an ExtensionType with pandas as class decorator"
- Function: "This enables operations like `.astype(name)` for the name of the ExtensionDtype"
- Returns: "A class decorator"

**Key Finding**: The documentation does NOT specify:
- Whether duplicate registrations are allowed or prevented
- Whether the registration should be idempotent
- What happens when the same dtype is registered multiple times
- Any expected behavior regarding re-registration

### pandas.core.dtypes.base.Registry
The docstring for the Registry class states:
- "Registry for dtype inference"
- "Multiple extension types can be registered. These are tried in order."
- The registry maps string repr to extension dtype

**Key Finding**: While it mentions "multiple extension types can be registered," this refers to different types, not duplicate registrations of the same type.

### Extending pandas documentation
The extending guide mentions that "ExtensionDtype can be registered to pandas to allow creation via a string dtype name" but provides no guidance on:
- Duplicate registration handling
- Idempotency expectations
- Best practices for re-registration scenarios

## Documentation Gaps
1. No documentation explicitly states that duplicate registrations should be prevented
2. No documentation states that duplicate registrations are expected or supported
3. No guidance on what users should expect when registering the same dtype multiple times
4. No warning about potential memory implications of duplicate registrations

## Reasonable Expectations
Given the nature of registration systems in general programming practice:
1. Most registration systems are idempotent (registering the same thing twice has no additional effect)
2. Registry patterns typically prevent duplicates to avoid confusion and waste
3. The name "register" implies a one-time action for each unique item

## Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly define the expected behavior for duplicate registrations. However, the current behavior (unbounded growth) appears unintentional and inconsistent with common registration patterns. This could be considered either a BUG (the code doesn't implement reasonable expected behavior) or a DOCUMENTATION_FIX (the documentation should clarify this unexpected behavior).
