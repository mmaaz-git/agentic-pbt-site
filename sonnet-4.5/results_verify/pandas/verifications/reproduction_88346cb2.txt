## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. The technical details in the bug report are accurate.

**Confirmed behavior:**
1. `Infinity == Infinity` returns `True` (as expected)
2. `Infinity > Infinity` returns `True` (UNEXPECTED)
3. `Infinity < Infinity` returns `False` (as expected)
4. `Infinity <= Infinity` returns `False` (UNEXPECTED - should be True since == is True)
5. `Infinity >= Infinity` returns `True` (as expected)

**Trichotomy law violation confirmed:**
The trichotomy law states that for any two values a and b, exactly one of the following must be true:
- a < b
- a == b
- a > b

In this case, when comparing Infinity with itself:
- `Infinity < Infinity` = False
- `Infinity == Infinity` = True
- `Infinity > Infinity` = True

Two of these comparisons return True, violating the trichotomy law.

**Mathematical consistency issues:**
1. When a == b is True, both a < b and a > b should be False
2. When a == b is True, both a <= b and a >= b should be True
3. The current implementation violates both of these principles

**Root cause:**
The __gt__ method in InfinityType unconditionally returns True:
```python
def __gt__(self, other: object) -> bool:
    return True
```

This means Infinity > Infinity returns True, even though Infinity == Infinity also returns True.

Similarly, __le__ unconditionally returns False, causing Infinity <= Infinity to return False even when they are equal.

**Proposed fix verification:**
The bug report suggests changing __gt__ to:
```python
def __gt__(self, other: object) -> bool:
    return not isinstance(other, type(self))
```
This would make Infinity > Infinity return False while maintaining Infinity > (any other value) returns True.
