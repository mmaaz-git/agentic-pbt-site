Bug Reproduction Report
=======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.compat.is_platform_power function.

Reproduction Steps:
-------------------

1. Ran the Hypothesis test provided in the bug report:
   - The test checks that "ppc64" exists in the source code (PASSED)
   - The test checks that either "ARM" is not in the docstring OR "Power" is in the docstring (PASSED)
   - However, detailed inspection shows both "ARM" and "Power" are present in the docstring

2. Ran the inspection code to view the function source:
   ```python
   from pandas.compat import is_platform_power
   import inspect
   print(inspect.getsource(is_platform_power))
   ```

   Output confirms the bug:
   ```python
   def is_platform_power() -> bool:
       """
       Checking if the running platform use Power architecture.

       Returns
       -------
       bool
           True if the running platform uses ARM architecture.
       """
       return platform.machine() in ("ppc64", "ppc64le")
   ```

3. Verified the actual source code location:
   - Located at: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/compat/__init__.py
   - Line 125 contains the incorrect text: "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture."

Bug Confirmed:
--------------
The function correctly checks for Power architecture platforms (ppc64, ppc64le) in its implementation, and the summary line of the docstring correctly states "Checking if the running platform use Power architecture." However, the Returns section incorrectly states "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture."

This appears to be a copy-paste error from the is_platform_arm() function that appears just above this function in the same file (lines 104-115).

Impact:
-------
This is a documentation inconsistency that could confuse developers reading the API documentation. The code itself functions correctly - it properly detects Power architecture platforms. Only the docstring's Returns section is incorrect.
