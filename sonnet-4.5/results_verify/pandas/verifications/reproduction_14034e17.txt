## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Test Results:

1. **Main Bug Reproduction**:
   - When calling `import_optional_dependency("numpy", min_version="999.0.0", errors="ignore")`, the function returns `None` instead of the numpy module.
   - Numpy is installed (version 2.3.0) and can be imported successfully.
   - When no version requirement is specified, the function correctly returns the numpy module.

2. **Code Behavior Analysis**:
   The implementation at lines 163-166 shows:
   ```python
   elif errors == "raise":
       raise ImportError(msg)
   else:
       return None  # This is the errors='ignore' case
   ```

   This code is executed when the version check fails (line 151 condition is true). The `else` branch handles the `errors='ignore'` case and returns `None`.

3. **Comparison with Other Error Modes**:
   - With `errors='warn'`: Also returns `None` but emits a warning (consistent behavior)
   - With `errors='raise'`: Would raise an ImportError (not tested but evident from code)

4. **Property-Based Test**:
   The hypothesis test from the bug report fails immediately, confirming that the function returns `None` when a high version requirement is specified with `errors='ignore'`.

### Technical Accuracy of the Bug Report:

The bug report is technically accurate in its observations:
1. The function does return `None` when `errors='ignore'` and version is too old
2. The code location (lines 163-166) is correctly identified
3. The proposed fix would indeed make the function return the module

### Behavior vs. Documentation:

The key issue is that the documentation contains a contradiction:
- Line 111 of the docstring says the function should "return the module, even if the version is too old"
- Lines 122-123 say "None is returned... when the package's version is too old and errors is... 'ignore'"
- The actual implementation follows the second interpretation (returns None)
