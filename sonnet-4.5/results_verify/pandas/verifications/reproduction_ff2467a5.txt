Bug Reproduction Results
========================

I successfully reproduced the issue described in the bug report. Here are the findings:

1. NATTYPE CONSTRUCTOR BEHAVIOR:
   - NaTType() creates new instances each time it's called
   - nat1 = pandas.api.typing.NaTType() creates instance 1
   - nat2 = pandas.api.typing.NaTType() creates instance 2
   - nat1 is nat2: False (they are different objects)
   - nat1 is pd.NaT: False (neither is the singleton)
   - nat2 is pd.NaT: False (neither is the singleton)

2. NATYPE CONSTRUCTOR BEHAVIOR:
   - NAType() returns the singleton pd.NA every time
   - na1 = pandas.api.typing.NAType() returns pd.NA
   - na2 = pandas.api.typing.NAType() returns pd.NA
   - na1 is na2: True (same object)
   - na1 is pd.NA: True (is the singleton)
   - na2 is pd.NA: True (is the singleton)

3. COMPARISON BEHAVIOR:
   - nat1 == nat2: False (instances are not equal)
   - nat1 == pd.NaT: False (instances don't equal the singleton)
   - This is particularly problematic because two NaT values should be considered equal

4. SINGLETON STATUS OF pd.NaT:
   - pd.NaT itself IS a singleton (pd.NaT is pd.NaT: True)
   - pd.NaT is of type pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype.NaTType
   - The singleton exists and works correctly when accessed via pd.NaT

5. PROPERTY-BASED TEST:
   - The hypothesis test fails with n=2
   - Two NaTType() calls produce two different objects
   - This violates the expectation of singleton behavior

TECHNICAL IMPACT:
The bug is REAL and REPRODUCIBLE. The issue is that:
1. NaTType() creates new instances instead of returning pd.NaT singleton
2. NAType() correctly returns pd.NA singleton
3. This inconsistency means code relying on identity checks (x is pd.NaT) will fail
4. Even equality checks fail (nat1 == pd.NaT returns False)

The behavior is inconsistent within the same module (pandas.api.typing), where NAType behaves as a singleton constructor but NaTType does not.
