## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is an internal pandas utility that is not part of the public API. Users should not be calling this function directly. The docstring doesn't specify the exact behavior for empty iterators or the contract for num_items. Since there's no documentation specifying what should happen with empty iterators and mismatched num_items, one could argue this is undefined behavior rather than a bug.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function contains an explicit assertion `assert last_i + 1 == num_items, "Fed in wrong num_items"` that clearly indicates the developer's intent to validate that num_items matches the actual number of arrays. The assertion message "Fed in wrong num_items" shows this is meant to catch programming errors. The bug allows this validation to be bypassed, which violates the clear intent expressed in the code.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal function that external users shouldn't be calling. All internal pandas usage of this function correctly passes matching num_items values. The bug only manifests with empty iterators, which is an edge case that doesn't occur in pandas' actual usage. The function works correctly for all real-world scenarios within pandas. Additionally, the impact is minimal - it just returns an empty array instead of raising an assertion for a case that never happens in practice.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Assertions are meant to catch programming errors and ensure code correctness. Even if this is an internal function, having inconsistent validation behavior (works for non-empty, fails for empty) is a code quality issue. Future pandas developers might rely on this validation and be surprised when it doesn't work for empty iterators. The fix is trivial (changing one line) and makes the function's behavior consistent.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function's docstring doesn't specify what happens with empty iterators or document the num_items validation requirement. One could argue that the code works as designed (returns empty array for empty iterator) and the documentation should be updated to clarify this behavior. The assertion could be considered an implementation detail rather than a contract.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The assertion in the code clearly shows the intent to validate num_items in all cases. The bug is not about unclear documentation but about code that doesn't implement its own validation consistently. The assertion message "Fed in wrong num_items" indicates this is meant to be enforced, not just documented as optional.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that adding validation for empty iterators is a new feature - extending the existing validation to cover an edge case. The current behavior (returning empty array) could be considered acceptable, and adding stricter validation would be an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The assertion already exists in the code with the clear intent to validate num_items. This isn't adding new functionality but fixing existing validation that doesn't work in all cases. The validation is already there; it just has a bug that prevents it from running with empty iterators.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function contains an assertion specifically to validate that num_items matches the iterator length, but this validation is bypassed for empty iterators due to an early return. This is clearly unintended behavior - the assertion should apply to all inputs, not just non-empty ones. The fix is straightforward and makes the validation consistent. The assertion's purpose is to catch programming errors, and the bug prevents it from doing so in certain cases.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an internal function that isn't part of pandas' public API. The bug only affects edge cases that don't occur in actual pandas usage. No real user code is affected since users shouldn't be calling this function directly. The severity is extremely low, and it could be considered pedantic to file this as a bug.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at all the considerations, this case presents a technically valid but practically insignificant issue. The bug report is technically correct: the function does fail to validate num_items for empty iterators, bypassing an assertion that's clearly meant to validate all inputs. The code shows clear intent through the assertion, and the bug prevents this intent from being realized consistently.

However, several factors diminish the importance of this bug. First, combine_hash_arrays is an internal pandas function not exposed in the public API, meaning users should never be calling it directly. Second, all actual usage within pandas correctly provides matching num_items values, so this bug never manifests in real scenarios. Third, the impact is minimal - it just returns an empty array instead of raising an assertion error.

While the technical analysis in the bug report is accurate and the proposed fix would make the code more correct, this falls into the category of an extremely low-priority issue that most maintainers would likely close as WONTFIX. It's the type of pedantic correctness that, while technically valid, provides no practical value since the buggy code path is never executed in actual usage. The function works correctly for all cases that matter in pandas' implementation, and fixing this would be purely academic.
