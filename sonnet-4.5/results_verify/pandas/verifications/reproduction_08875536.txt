## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug as reported. Here are the findings:

### 1. Main Bug Behavior
- **Confirmed**: `pandas_dtype(None)` returns `float64` (does NOT raise TypeError)
- **Confirmed**: `_get_dtype(None)` raises TypeError with message "Cannot deduce dtype from null object"
- This creates an inconsistency between the public API and the internal function

### 2. Test Results
Running the reproduction code yielded:
```
pandas_dtype(None) = float64
Type: <class 'numpy.dtypes.Float64DType'>
_get_dtype(None) raised TypeError: Cannot deduce dtype from null object
```

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The behavior stems from line 1663 in pandas_dtype:
```python
npdtype = np.dtype(dtype)
```
NumPy's `np.dtype(None)` returns `float64` by default, and pandas_dtype doesn't check for None before passing to numpy.

### 4. Related Function Behavior
- `is_dtype_equal(None, None)` returns False (treats None as invalid)
- `is_dtype_equal(None, 'float64')` returns False (does not consider None equivalent to float64)
- This shows that other dtype-related functions in pandas treat None as an invalid/special case

### 5. Hypothesis Test
The property-based test correctly identifies the issue. The test expects TypeError but gets float64 instead.

### 6. Technical Accuracy
The bug report is technically accurate in all its claims:
- The inconsistency between pandas_dtype and _get_dtype exists
- The documentation says TypeError should be raised "if not a dtype"
- None is silently converted to float64 through numpy's behavior
- The proposed fix would align pandas_dtype with _get_dtype behavior

The reproduction confirms that the bug report accurately describes the actual behavior of the code.
