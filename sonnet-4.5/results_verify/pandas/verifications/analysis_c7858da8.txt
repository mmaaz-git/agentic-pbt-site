## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is real and reproducible - ujson_dumps/loads DO lose precision
- The round-trip property failure is not a user error or misunderstanding
- IEEE 754 standard requires 17 digits for full double precision, but ujson limits to 15
- Standard json module handles this correctly, setting reasonable expectations

**Conclusion:** NOT INVALID - This is a legitimate precision loss issue

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- ujson is explicitly designed to prioritize speed over precision
- The 15-digit limit might be considered an acceptable trade-off
- Users who need full precision could use standard json module instead

**Arguments Against:**
- This affects data integrity in scientific/financial applications
- Silent data loss is a serious issue
- pandas already acknowledged this as a bug (Issue #38437)
- The issue was actually fixed in PR #54100, showing pandas team considers it worth fixing

**Conclusion:** NOT WONTFIX - The pandas team has already acknowledged and addressed similar issues

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The precision loss behavior exists by design in ujson
- The code technically "works" within its 15-digit limitation
- Adding documentation warnings would help users understand the limitation
- The double_precision parameter IS documented, just not its implications

**Arguments Against:**
- This isn't just a documentation issue - it's actual data loss
- The pandas team has already classified this as a BUG (not documentation issue)
- Users reasonably expect JSON serialization to preserve float precision
- The behavior violates basic round-trip expectations

**Conclusion:** While documentation should be improved, this is MORE than just a documentation issue

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Full 17-digit precision could be seen as a "new feature" for ujson integration
- The current behavior might be considered "working as designed"

**Arguments Against:**
- Preserving float precision is a basic expectation, not a new feature
- The standard json module already does this correctly
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- pandas team classified this as a BUG, not a feature request

**Conclusion:** NOT a FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing existing broken behavior

### Considering BUG
**Arguments For:**
- Silent precision loss violates user expectations
- Round-trip property failure (ujson_loads(ujson_dumps(x)) != x)
- Inconsistent with standard json module behavior
- No documentation warns about this limitation
- IEEE 754 requires 17 digits, but ujson artificially limits to 15
- pandas team officially acknowledged this as a BUG in Issue #38437
- The issue causes actual data corruption in scientific/financial contexts
- A fix was already implemented (PR #54100), confirming it's a bug worth fixing

**Arguments Against:**
- ujson is known to prioritize speed over precision (but this isn't documented in pandas)

**Conclusion:** This IS a BUG

### Final Analysis

This is clearly a BUG for the following reasons:

1. **Data Integrity**: Silent precision loss corrupts data without warning
2. **Violated Expectations**: Users expect JSON serialization to preserve float values
3. **Standard Compliance**: Fails to meet IEEE 754 double precision requirements
4. **Undocumented Behavior**: No warnings about precision limitations in pandas docs
5. **Official Recognition**: pandas team has already acknowledged this as a bug
6. **Practical Impact**: Affects real-world scientific and financial applications

The bug report is well-written, provides clear reproduction steps, demonstrates the issue with both property-based and manual tests, and correctly identifies the root cause. The suggested fixes are reasonable and actionable.
