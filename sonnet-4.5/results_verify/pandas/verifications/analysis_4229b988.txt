## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function's docstring explicitly states it raises `TypeError` for values that "can't be converted to one"
- The function already has error-handling logic that converts other exceptions (ValueError, AssertionError) to TypeError
- The pattern of catching multiple exceptions and re-raising as TypeError shows clear intent to provide a uniform exception interface
- Users of this function would reasonably expect TypeError based on the documentation
- The fix is trivial and consistent with the existing error handling pattern
- This affects real usage in `pandas.core.indexes.range.RangeIndex.__new__` where consistent error types matter

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None significant - the documentation is clear and the implementation doesn't match it

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could argue that OverflowError is a more specific/descriptive error than TypeError
- Python's int() naturally raises OverflowError for infinity, which is semantically correct

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation explicitly promises TypeError for ALL conversion failures
- The function already converts other valid exceptions (ValueError) to TypeError, showing intent to normalize errors
- The function name and purpose is to "ensure" a python int, not to provide detailed error diagnostics
- Exception type consistency is more important than specificity for a utility function

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Infinity values are edge cases that might rarely occur in practice
- The current OverflowError is technically correct from Python's perspective

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - infinity is a standard float value
- The bug breaks the documented contract which users may depend on
- The fix is trivial (adding OverflowError to the caught exceptions)
- This is not about internal implementation details but a public contract

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could update the documentation to say "Raises TypeError or OverflowError"
- The current behavior (raising OverflowError) is reasonable for infinity values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The existing pattern of catching and re-raising as TypeError shows the intent was to normalize all errors
- Changing documentation would be inconsistent with how ValueError is already handled
- The function's purpose is to provide a consistent interface, not expose implementation details
- Users may already have code that catches TypeError based on the current documentation

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - this is clearly about existing documented behavior not matching implementation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation already specifies the expected behavior
- This is a bug where implementation doesn't match specification, not a request for new functionality

### Final Assessment
This is a clear **BUG**. The function has explicit documentation stating it raises `TypeError` for any value that can't be converted to an integer. The implementation violates this contract by allowing `OverflowError` to propagate for infinity values. The function already demonstrates intent to normalize exceptions (converting ValueError and AssertionError to TypeError), so failing to handle OverflowError is an oversight.

The bug is:
1. Well-defined (clear contract violation)
2. Reproducible (consistent behavior with infinity)
3. Fixable (trivial one-line change)
4. Impactful (affects error handling in calling code)
5. Not a matter of interpretation (documentation is explicit)
