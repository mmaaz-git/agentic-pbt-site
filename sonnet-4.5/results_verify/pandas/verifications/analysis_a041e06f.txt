## Triage Analysis for pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable Bug Report

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The function's documented purpose is to return a boolean indicating whether an object can be compiled as a regex. Raising an exception violates this contract.

2. **Function Name Semantics**: The "is_" prefix convention in Python indicates a predicate function that returns a boolean without side effects or exceptions.

3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: The function catches `TypeError` for non-string inputs (returning `False`) but not `re.error` for invalid regex strings (raising exception). This inconsistency is clearly a bug.

4. **Defeats Function Purpose**: Users need to wrap the function in try-except to use it safely, which defeats the entire purpose of having a safe checking function.

5. **Simple Fix Available**: The bug report provides a straightforward fix that aligns the implementation with the documentation.

**Arguments Against:**
- None. This is clearly a bug based on documented behavior.

### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- None. The documentation clearly states the function should return a boolean.

**Arguments Against:**
- The function explicitly documents that it returns a `bool` type
- The examples show it returning `False` for invalid inputs (like integers)
- The behavior contradicts the documented contract

### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- None. This is not an obscure edge case - invalid regex patterns are common in real-world data processing.

**Arguments Against:**
- This affects basic functionality of a public API function
- Invalid regex patterns are common enough to warrant proper handling
- The function's entire purpose is to safely check compilability

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- None. The documentation is correct; the implementation is wrong.

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation clearly and correctly describes what the function should do
- The current implementation is the problem, not the documentation
- Changing documentation to say "may raise PatternError" would make the function useless

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- None. This is not requesting new functionality.

**Arguments Against:**
- The function already claims to provide this functionality in its documentation
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The expected behavior is already documented

### Conclusion
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The function `is_re_compilable` has a clear, documented contract to return a boolean value indicating whether an object can be compiled as a regex pattern. The current implementation violates this contract by raising `PatternError` for invalid regex strings instead of returning `False`. The bug is reproducible, affects a public API, and has a straightforward fix that aligns the implementation with its documented behavior.
