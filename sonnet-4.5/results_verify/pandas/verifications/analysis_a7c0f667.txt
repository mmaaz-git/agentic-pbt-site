## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments for BUG:**
1. The function has an explicit type annotation `-> str` declaring it returns a string
2. The function's own code assumes the version is a string (line 81: `version.split()[0]`)
3. When `__version__` is non-string, the function violates its type contract by returning non-string values
4. This causes AttributeError crashes for psycopg2 modules with non-string versions
5. The type annotation creates a contract that callers can rely on receiving a string

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The function is in a private module (_optional) not meant for external use
- Python conventions suggest but don't enforce that __version__ should be a string

### INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
1. The module is private (pandas.compat._optional) and not part of the public API
2. Users shouldn't be using this function directly
3. Real Python packages should follow convention and have string __version__ attributes

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The function has a clear type contract that it violates
- The function itself crashes on psycopg2 modules with non-string versions
- Even internal functions should handle edge cases gracefully

### WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
1. This is an obscure edge case - real Python packages follow convention with string versions
2. The function is internal/private and not meant for external use
3. The issue would never occur in practice with properly packaged modules

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The fix is trivial (one line: `version = str(version)`)
- The function already handles None case explicitly
- Type safety violations should be fixed

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Handling non-string __version__ attributes could be seen as a new feature
2. The function was never designed to handle non-string versions

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing a type contract violation, not adding new functionality
- The function already claims to return str but doesn't always do so

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation could specify that modules must have string __version__ attributes
2. The type annotation could be changed to return `Any` instead of `str`

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code crashes with AttributeError for psycopg2, which is a real bug
- Changing the return type would break type checking for callers
- The fix should be in the code, not documentation

### Conclusion:
This is a **BUG**. The function violates its own type contract by returning non-string values when it explicitly declares `-> str`. The function's implementation also assumes the version is a string (line 81), leading to AttributeError crashes. While the module is private and real packages should use string versions, the type safety violation and potential for crashes make this a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
