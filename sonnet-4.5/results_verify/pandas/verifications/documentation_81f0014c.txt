## Documentation Analysis for DeepChainMap.__delitem__

### Source Code Documentation
The DeepChainMap class is defined in pandas/core/computation/scope.py with the following docstring:
- Class-level: "Variant of ChainMap that allows direct updates to inner scopes. Only works when all passed mapping are mutable."
- __delitem__ method: "Raises KeyError If `key` doesn't exist."

The docstring for __delitem__ is minimal and only documents the exception case. It does NOT specify:
1. What happens when a key exists in multiple maps
2. Whether deletion removes the key from all maps or just the first one
3. The expected behavior after deletion (whether the key should remain accessible)

### Python Standard Library ChainMap Behavior
Testing reveals that Python's standard ChainMap exhibits the same behavior:
- ChainMap only deletes from the first map where the key is found
- If the key exists in multiple maps, it remains accessible from subsequent maps after deletion
- This is consistent with the Python documentation stating "writes, updates, and deletions only operate on the first mapping"

### DeepChainMap Design Intent
The DeepChainMap class is explicitly designed as a "Variant of ChainMap that allows direct updates to inner scopes." Looking at the implementation:
- __setitem__ updates the key in the FIRST map where it exists (not all maps)
- __delitem__ deletes the key from the FIRST map where it exists (not all maps)
- Both methods maintain consistency in their "first-found" approach

### Key Observation
The class name "DeepChainMap" and its docstring about "direct updates to inner scopes" might suggest it would handle nested updates differently than ChainMap, but the actual implementation shows it maintains ChainMap's first-found semantics for both set and delete operations. The "deep" aspect appears to refer to allowing mutation of inner maps, not to operating on all occurrences of a key.

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not explicitly state:
1. The deletion semantics when keys exist in multiple maps
2. That the behavior mirrors standard ChainMap behavior
3. That after deletion, a key may still be accessible if it exists in other maps
