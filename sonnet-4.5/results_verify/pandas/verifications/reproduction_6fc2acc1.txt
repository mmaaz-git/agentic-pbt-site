## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Summary
The bug report claims that `FixedForwardWindowIndexer.get_window_bounds()` produces invalid window bounds where start > end when initialized with negative `window_size` values.

### Reproduction Results

#### 1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The Hypothesis property-based test successfully identified the bug with the exact failing input specified in the report:
- Test input: `num_values=2, window_size=-1`
- Result: AssertionError at index 1 where `start[1]=1 > end[1]=0`

This confirms the bug report's claim that the invariant `start[i] <= end[i]` is violated.

#### 2. Manual Reproduction
Running the manual reproduction code confirmed the bug exactly as described:
- With `window_size=-1` and `num_values=2`:
  - start: [0, 1]
  - end: [0, 0]
  - Violation: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0

#### 3. Extended Testing
Additional tests with various negative window sizes showed consistent violations:
- `window_size=-2`: Multiple violations where start > end
- `window_size=-5`: All indices except 0 showed violations
- `window_size=-10`: All indices except 0 showed violations

The pattern shows that when `window_size` is negative:
1. The end values are computed as `start + window_size`
2. Negative end values are clipped to 0
3. This causes start values to exceed end values for indices > 0

### Effect of the Bug
The bug produces mathematically invalid window boundaries that violate the fundamental invariant of window indexers. This would lead to:
1. Invalid slice operations (trying to slice from a higher index to a lower index)
2. Empty windows where data was expected
3. Incorrect results in rolling window operations (likely producing NaN values)

### Conclusion
The bug is successfully reproduced and behaves exactly as described in the bug report. The issue occurs consistently when negative `window_size` values are provided to `FixedForwardWindowIndexer`.
