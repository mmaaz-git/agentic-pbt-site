TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Analyzing the bug report for possible categorizations:

1. CONSIDERATION AS BUG:
   REASONS TO CLASSIFY AS BUG:
   - Clear inconsistency between C and Python engines for identical input
   - Data loss occurs (Python engine silently drops valid rows)
   - The C engine's behavior is more logically consistent with CSV semantics
   - A quoted empty string ("") is structurally different from a blank line
   - Users reasonably expect both engines to produce identical output
   - The workaround (skip_blank_lines=False) shouldn't be necessary for valid data

   EVIDENCE:
   - Reproducible with simple test case
   - Affects real-world use cases where CSVs may contain empty strings
   - Inconsistent engine behavior violates principle of least surprise

2. CONSIDERATION AS INVALID:
   REASONS AGAINST:
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly promise engine consistency
   - Documentation doesn't define what constitutes a "blank line"
   - RFC 4180 doesn't explicitly address this scenario

   COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
   - Engine consistency is a reasonable implicit expectation
   - The semantic difference between "" and blank line is clear from CSV grammar

3. CONSIDERATION AS WONTFIX:
   REASONS TO MARK AS WONTFIX:
   - Workaround exists (skip_blank_lines=False)
   - Only affects single-column CSVs with quoted empty strings (edge case)

   COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
   - Data loss is never trivial
   - The edge case is still valid CSV data
   - Silent data loss without warning is serious

4. CONSIDERATION AS DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   REASONS TO MARK AS DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - Could argue documentation should specify engine differences
   - Documentation should define "blank line" more clearly

   COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
   - The inconsistent behavior itself is the problem, not just documentation
   - Documenting a bug doesn't make it not a bug

5. CONSIDERATION AS FEATURE_REQUEST:
   REASONS TO MARK AS FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could argue consistency between engines is a new feature

   COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
   - This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
   - Engine consistency should be baseline expectation

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- Medium severity is appropriate:
  * Not a crash or security issue (would be High)
  * But causes silent data loss (more than Low)
  * Has a workaround but requires knowing about the issue

CONCLUSION:
This is a valid BUG. The Python engine incorrectly interprets quoted empty strings as blank lines, causing:
1. Inconsistent behavior between parsing engines
2. Silent data loss
3. Violation of CSV semantic rules (quoted empty field â‰  blank line)

The fact that a workaround exists doesn't negate that this is incorrect behavior that should be fixed.
