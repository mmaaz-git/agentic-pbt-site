## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report correctly identifies an issue with `pandas.core.arrays.sparse.SparseArray.density` when called on an empty array. However, the bug report states it returns NaN, but in reality it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Direct reproduction test**:
   - Created empty SparseArray: `SparseArray([])`
   - Verified len = 0 and npoints = 0
   - Attempted to access `.density` property
   - **Result**: `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero` (NOT NaN as claimed in bug report)

2. **Hypothesis property-based test**:
   - Ran the provided test with arrays of various sizes including empty arrays
   - Empty arrays (e.g., `array([], dtype=int8)`) consistently triggered `ZeroDivisionError`
   - Non-empty arrays correctly calculated density as `npoints / length`
   - Test correctly identified the bug but with different error type than claimed

### Source Code Analysis
From `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/arrays/sparse/array.py`:
```python
@property
def density(self) -> float:
    """
    The percent of non- ``fill_value`` points, as decimal.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pandas.arrays import SparseArray
    >>> s = SparseArray([0, 0, 1, 1, 1], fill_value=0)
    >>> s.density
    0.6
    """
    return self.sp_index.npoints / self.sp_index.length
```

The implementation directly performs `npoints / length` without checking for empty arrays, causing `0 / 0` which raises `ZeroDivisionError` in Python 3.

### Test Coverage Analysis
- Found minimal test coverage: only one simple test in `test_array.py` that tests `density == 0.5` for `SparseArray([0, 1])`
- No tests found for empty SparseArray cases
- No tests found for edge cases or boundary conditions

### Conclusion
The bug is **CONFIRMED** - there is indeed an issue with the density property on empty arrays. However, the bug manifests as a `ZeroDivisionError` rather than returning NaN as claimed. The lack of handling for empty arrays is a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
