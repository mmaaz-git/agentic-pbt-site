## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation

The `_check_for_default_values` function is an internal pandas function (indicated by the leading underscore). The docstring states:

```
Check that the keys in `arg_val_dict` are mapped to their
default values as specified in `compat_args`.

Note that this function is to be called only when it has been
checked that arg_val_dict.keys() is a subset of compat_args
```

### Code Comments

The most relevant documentation is in the code comments:

1. Lines 58-60: "try checking equality directly with '=' operator, as comparison may have been overridden for the left hand object"

2. Lines 75-76: "could not compare them directly, so try comparison using the 'is' operator"

These comments clearly indicate the INTENT of the code:
- First, try equality comparison using ==
- If comparison fails, fall back to identity comparison using 'is'

### Key Observations

1. **No public API documentation exists** - This is an internal function not exposed in pandas' public API.

2. **The comments show clear intent** - The comments at lines 75-76 state "could not compare them directly" (implying ANY failure in comparison), not "could not compare due to ValueError".

3. **The fallback mechanism is intentional** - The code structure with try-except and the comment "so try comparison using the 'is' operator" shows that the fallback to identity comparison is a deliberate design choice.

4. **No specification of which exceptions to catch** - Neither the docstring nor comments specify that ONLY ValueError should trigger the fallback. The comment says "could not compare them directly" which is generic.

### Conclusion

Based on the documentation (comments) in the code, the intent is clearly to fall back to 'is' comparison when the equality comparison fails for ANY reason. The current implementation only catching ValueError appears to be an oversight that doesn't match the documented intent in the comments. The bug report correctly identifies that the implementation doesn't match the intended behavior described in the comments.
