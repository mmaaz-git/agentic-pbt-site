## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the hypothesis test and manual reproduction code confirmed the issue.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test failed immediately with the first example (n=0). The test correctly identified that when two InfinityType instances are equal, the comparison `inf1 > inf2` incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Manual Test Results
The manual test output shows the inconsistent behavior clearly:

For InfinityType:
- `inf1 == inf2: True` (two instances are equal)
- `inf1 > inf2: True` (INCORRECT - should be False when equal)
- `inf1 < inf2: False` (correct)
- `inf1 <= inf2: False` (INCORRECT - should be True when equal)
- `inf1 >= inf2: True` (correct)

For NegativeInfinityType:
- `ninf1 == ninf2: True` (two instances are equal)
- `ninf1 < ninf2: True` (INCORRECT - should be False when equal)
- `ninf1 <= ninf2: True` (correct)

### Source Code Verification
I examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/util/version/__init__.py`.

The InfinityType class (lines 25-51) has hardcoded comparison methods:
- `__lt__`: always returns `False`
- `__le__`: always returns `False`
- `__gt__`: always returns `True`
- `__ge__`: always returns `True`
- `__eq__`: checks if `other` is an instance of the same type

The NegativeInfinityType class (lines 57-83) has similar issues:
- `__lt__`: always returns `True`
- `__le__`: always returns `True`
- `__gt__`: always returns `False`
- `__ge__`: always returns `False`
- `__eq__`: checks if `other` is an instance of the same type

### The Problem
The bug is real and exactly as described. When comparing two equal InfinityType or NegativeInfinityType instances:
1. The equality check correctly returns `True`
2. But the comparison operators don't check if they're comparing with another instance of the same type
3. This violates the fundamental principle of comparison operators: if `a == b`, then `a > b` and `a < b` must be `False`

The bug affects logical consistency in comparison operations and could lead to incorrect sorting or comparison behavior when these infinity types are used in version comparisons.
