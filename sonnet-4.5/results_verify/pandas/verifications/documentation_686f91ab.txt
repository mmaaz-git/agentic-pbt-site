## Documentation Analysis for pandas.qcut

### Official Documentation Review

The pandas.qcut function documentation states:
- **Purpose**: "Discretize variable into equal-sized buckets based on rank or based on sample quantiles"
- **Input**: Accepts "1d ndarray or Series"
- **Parameters**: Has a `precision` parameter (default=3) for "The precision at which to store and display the bins labels"

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **No Restrictions on Input Values**:
   - Documentation does NOT specify any restrictions on the magnitude of input values
   - No mention of limitations for very small or very large floating-point numbers
   - No warning about potential issues with values near floating-point limits

2. **Valid Input Expectations**:
   - The documentation only states the input should be "1d ndarray or Series"
   - It mentions "Out of bounds values will be NA" but doesn't define what constitutes "out of bounds"
   - No indication that finite, non-NaN floats could cause failures

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Documentation mentions ValueError for non-unique bin edges (with duplicates='raise')
   - No mention of potential errors from precision/rounding issues
   - The confusing error message "missing values must be missing in the same location" is not documented

4. **Precision Parameter**:
   - Described as controlling "precision at which to store and display the bins labels"
   - No warning that high precision calculations could fail for extreme values
   - No documented maximum effective precision or edge cases

5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Function should discretize ANY valid numeric data into quantile-based bins
   - The test input contains all valid, finite floats (including 2.2250738585072014e-308)
   - Based on documentation, this should either:
     a) Successfully create 4 quantile bins, OR
     b) Raise a documented, meaningful error

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation fails to mention:
1. Limitations when handling values near floating-point limits (e.g., near 1e-308)
2. Potential NaN generation during internal rounding operations
3. Maximum effective precision for the precision parameter
4. The misleading error message that can occur with valid input

### Conclusion

The documentation provides no indication that valid finite floating-point numbers could cause the function to fail. The input values in the bug report are completely within the documented specifications. The function's failure with a confusing error message on valid input represents undocumented behavior that violates the reasonable expectations set by the documentation.
