## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This is an internal, private function that's not part of pandas' public API. There's no documentation specifying how it should handle edge cases. A psycopg2 module with a whitespace-only version string is an artificial test case that would never occur in real-world usage, as actual psycopg2 installations always have proper version strings. The function works correctly for all legitimate use cases.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug causes a real crash with an unhelpful error message. Even though it's an edge case, the function already has error handling for missing versions (raising ImportError), so it's inconsistent to crash with IndexError in this specific case. The code has a clear bug where it doesn't check if the split() result is empty before accessing index [0].

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an extremely obscure edge case that will never happen in practice. Real psycopg2 installations always have valid version strings like "2.9.6" or "2.9.6 (dt dec pq3 ext lo64)". The scenario of a psycopg2 module with whitespace-only version is purely theoretical and created by property-based testing. The effort to fix this is not justified by any real-world benefit.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial (3 lines of code) and follows the existing error-handling pattern. Even if the case is rare, crashes should be avoided when possible. The proposed fix makes the code more robust without any downsides or performance impact.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There's no documentation for this internal function, so one could argue that documentation should be added to specify how edge cases are handled. However, since this is a private function not meant for public use, adding documentation would be inappropriate.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue. The function crashes with IndexError when it should handle the error gracefully. The lack of documentation doesn't change the fact that the code has a bug. Documentation fixes are for when the code works as designed but the documentation is wrong or unclear.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that handling whitespace-only version strings is a new feature since the function was never designed to handle this case. The current implementation assumes psycopg2 will always have at least one non-whitespace token in its version string.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality. The function already has error handling for invalid versions (raising ImportError when __version__ is None). This is extending existing error handling to cover another error case, not adding a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code has a clear programming error: it accesses index [0] of a list without checking if the list is empty. This violates basic defensive programming practices. The function already has a pattern for handling invalid versions (raising ImportError), but fails to apply it consistently. The crash with IndexError provides no useful information to developers about what went wrong.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an artificial edge case created by property-based testing that would never occur in real usage. The function is private/internal and not documented. psycopg2 modules in the wild always have valid version strings. The bug has no real-world impact and fixing it adds complexity for no practical benefit.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report presents an edge case discovered through property-based testing where the internal `get_version` function crashes with an IndexError when processing a psycopg2 module with a whitespace-only version string. While the scenario is artificial and would never occur with real psycopg2 installations, the code does contain a technical error where it accesses a list element without checking if the list is empty.

The key factors to consider are: (1) This is a private, internal function not part of the public API, (2) The scenario is completely artificial and has no real-world impact, (3) The fix is trivial but adds code for a case that will never happen in practice, and (4) The function already has error handling for other invalid version cases.

Given that this is an internal function handling an impossible real-world scenario, and considering the extremely low impact and artificial nature of the issue, this should be classified as WONTFIX. While there is technically a programming error, the cost-benefit analysis strongly favors not fixing this issue. The bug will never affect any real users, and adding code to handle this case provides no practical value while slightly increasing code complexity.
