TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID
----------
Arguments FOR INVALID:
- The example in the docstring shows passing cls for classmethods, implying this is the intended usage
- One could argue that "classmethod" inherently means it should receive a class, not an instance

Arguments AGAINST INVALID:
- The API accepts the invalid input without error at initialization
- The documentation doesn't explicitly forbid passing instances for classmethods
- The parameter name "class_instance" is ambiguous and suggests both classes and instances are acceptable
- The crash happens in an unexpected place (__str__) rather than at initialization

Verdict: NOT INVALID - The API design allows the problematic input and fails ungracefully

2. WONTFIX
----------
Arguments FOR WONTFIX:
- This is an edge case that likely doesn't occur often in practice
- Users following the documented examples won't encounter this issue
- The workaround is simple: pass a class for classmethods

Arguments AGAINST WONTFIX:
- The crash is ungraceful and produces a confusing error message
- The API violates the principle of "fail early" - it accepts invalid input then crashes later
- This is a legitimate API inconsistency, not just a minor edge case
- The fix is straightforward and improves API robustness

Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - This is a real API design flaw that causes crashes

3. FEATURE_REQUEST
------------------
Arguments FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
- One could argue that supporting instances for classmethods is a new feature
- The current code was never designed to handle this case

Arguments AGAINST FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This isn't adding new functionality, it's fixing broken existing functionality
- The API already accepts the input; it just doesn't handle it correctly
- The issue is about making the existing API consistent, not adding features

Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new capabilities

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
--------------------
Arguments FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation could be clearer about the requirement for classmethods
- Adding explicit documentation about this restriction would prevent the issue

Arguments AGAINST DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code actually crashes - this is not just a documentation issue
- Even with better documentation, the API would still be inconsistent
- The crash produces an unhelpful error message that doesn't guide users
- Proper API design would validate inputs at initialization, not rely on documentation

Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - While docs could be better, the core issue is the crash

5. BUG
------
Arguments FOR BUG:
- The code crashes with AttributeError when given certain inputs
- The API accepts inputs it cannot handle correctly
- The error violates the principle of failing fast and with clear messages
- The __init__ method accepts any object but __str__ only works with specific types
- This is an API consistency issue where one method makes assumptions the other doesn't validate
- The fix is straightforward: add validation in __init__ to ensure correct usage
- Property-based testing reveals this as a systematic issue, not a one-off problem

Arguments AGAINST BUG:
- None significant - this is clearly a bug

Verdict: THIS IS A BUG

FINAL ASSESSMENT
----------------
This is a clear BUG. The AbstractMethodError class has an API design flaw where:

1. The __init__ method accepts any object as class_instance regardless of methodtype
2. The __str__ method assumes specific types based on methodtype without validation
3. This inconsistency causes crashes with unhelpful error messages

The proposed fix (adding validation in __init__) is appropriate and would:
- Make the API fail fast with clear error messages
- Ensure consistency between __init__ and __str__
- Prevent confusing AttributeError crashes
- Maintain backward compatibility for correct usage

This bug should be fixed to improve API robustness and user experience.
