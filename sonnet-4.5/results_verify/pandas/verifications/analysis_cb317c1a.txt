## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation explicitly guarantees symmetry when sym=True with no exceptions
- The parameter alpha=1e-300 is within the valid range [0, 1] specified in the documentation
- The symmetry property is fundamental to the window's purpose in filter design
- The bug has a clear, well-understood root cause (catastrophic cancellation in floating-point arithmetic)
- The fix is simple and preserves correct behavior for all cases
- This affects the correctness of signal processing calculations that depend on window symmetry

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Alpha values like 1e-300 are extremely small and might be considered impractical
- Could be viewed as a floating-point precision limitation

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Alpha values near 1e-300 are extremely small and unlikely in practical applications
- The issue only occurs with denormalized or near-zero alpha values
- Could be considered an edge case of floating-point arithmetic limitations

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation makes no mention of precision limitations
- The fix is trivial (just reordering arithmetic operations)
- There's no performance cost to fixing this
- The parameter is within the documented valid range

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug clearly violates documented behavior.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function explicitly promises symmetry
- The input parameters are valid according to the documentation
- The behavior is objectively wrong (asymmetric when it should be symmetric)

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is not requesting new functionality.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The symmetry property is already documented and promised
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that extreme alpha values may have numerical issues
- Could add a warning about floating-point precision limits

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is genuinely broken and can be easily fixed
- Documenting the bug doesn't solve the underlying correctness issue
- The fix is trivial and doesn't require changing the API or expected behavior

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function violates its explicit, documented guarantee of producing symmetric windows when sym=True. The issue occurs with valid input parameters (alpha is within [0,1]), has a well-understood cause (catastrophic cancellation), and has a simple fix that preserves correct behavior in all cases.

While the alpha values that trigger this bug are extremely small, they are still valid according to the API specification, and the symmetry guarantee is unconditional in the documentation. The fact that the fix is trivial (reordering arithmetic operations) and has no downsides makes this a clear bug that should be fixed rather than documented or dismissed.
