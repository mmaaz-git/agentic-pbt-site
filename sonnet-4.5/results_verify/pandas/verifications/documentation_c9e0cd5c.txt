DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR pandas.DataFrame.to_dict

Official Documentation Findings:
- The pandas documentation describes the 'split' and 'tight' orient options for to_dict()
- 'split' returns: {'index': [...], 'columns': [...], 'data': [[...]]}
- 'tight' returns: {'index': [...], 'columns': [...], 'data': [[...]], 'index_names': [...], 'column_names': [...]}
- The only documented difference between 'split' and 'tight' is that 'tight' includes additional metadata (index_names and column_names)
- NO performance differences are mentioned in the documentation
- NO implementation details are specified about how the data should be computed
- The documentation does not specify whether the 'data' field should be computed identically for both orientations

Code Documentation (from source comments):
- In pandas/core/frame.py, there is a helper function `_create_data_for_split_and_tight_to_dict`
- The docstring explicitly states: "Simple helper method to create data for to_dict(orient='split') and to_dict(orient='tight') to create the main output data"
- This indicates the INTENTION is for both orientations to use the same helper method for data creation
- The helper includes a performance optimization comment: "If we have object_dtype_cols, apply maybe_box_naive after list comprehension for perf"

Key Finding:
The existence of a shared helper function with "split_and_tight" in its name, along with its docstring, strongly suggests that both orientations were intended to use the same optimized data creation path. The documentation does not contradict this - it only describes the output format differences, not implementation differences.
