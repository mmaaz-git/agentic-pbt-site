## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for each category:

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The error message is objectively incorrect - the variables are swapped in the f-string
- The message says "methodtype must be one of invalid_type" which is logically wrong
- This creates confusion for users trying to debug their code
- The fix is straightforward and unambiguous
- The issue affects user experience and clarity of error communication

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- No strong reason against this being a bug

#### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- It's not invalid - the code demonstrably has swapped variables in the error message

**Why it might NOT be INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The error message is objectively backwards

#### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The error only occurs when users pass invalid parameters
- Users shouldn't be passing invalid methodtype values in normal usage
- The ValueError is still raised, so the code fails as expected

**Why it might NOT be WONTFIX:**
- Error messages are important for user experience
- When users make mistakes, clear error messages help them fix issues quickly
- This is not an obscure edge case - any invalid methodtype triggers this
- The fix is trivial (swap two variables)

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly list valid methodtype values

**Why it might NOT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The bug is in the code, not the documentation
- The error message formatting is wrong regardless of documentation
- Adding documentation wouldn't fix the backwards error message

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Better error messages could be considered a feature enhancement

**Why it might NOT be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The error message already exists, it's just malformed
- This is a bug fix, not a new feature

### Final Assessment:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The error message has swapped variables, making it say the opposite of what it should. The message tells users that the invalid value they provided is what's expected, and that the actual valid values are what they provided. This is objectively incorrect and misleading.

The bug:
1. Is reproducible
2. Has a clear, unambiguous fix
3. Affects user experience when debugging
4. Is not a trivial or obscure edge case
5. Has incorrect behavior that contradicts logical expectations

While the error only appears when users provide invalid input, error messages are a critical part of the user experience, especially for debugging. Clear, accurate error messages are essential for good software.
