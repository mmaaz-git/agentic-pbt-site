## Documentation Analysis

### Available Documentation:

1. **Public API Documentation**: The _Options class is not documented in the public pandas API documentation. Only `plot_params` is briefly mentioned as "Stores pandas plotting options" without detailed explanation.

2. **Source Code Documentation**: The class has a docstring that states:
   - "Stores pandas plotting options"
   - "Allows for parameter aliasing so you can just use parameter names that are the same as the plot function parameters, but is stored in a canonical format that makes it easy to breakdown into groups later."
   - Provides an example using the context manager `use()` method

3. **Method Documentation**: Only the `reset()` and `use()` methods have docstrings. The overridden methods like `__delitem__` do not have individual docstrings explaining their behavior.

### Key Observations:

1. **No explicit documentation about default key protection**: The documentation does not explicitly state that default keys cannot be removed. This behavior is only evident from reading the source code implementation.

2. **Class invariant is implicit**: The protection of default keys (stored in `_DEFAULT_KEYS = ["xaxis.compat"]`) is an implementation detail that creates an implicit class invariant. The `__delitem__` method enforces this by raising ValueError when attempting to delete a default key.

3. **Incomplete override coverage**: While `__delitem__` is overridden to protect default keys, other dict methods that can remove keys (`pop()`, `popitem()`, `clear()`) are not overridden and inherit the base dict behavior.

### Documentation vs Implementation:

The lack of explicit documentation about default key protection doesn't make this less of a bug. The implementation clearly shows an intent to protect default keys:
- The `_DEFAULT_KEYS` constant defines protected keys
- The `__delitem__` implementation explicitly checks and raises an error
- The error message "Cannot remove default parameter {key}" clearly indicates the intent

The fact that some removal methods bypass this protection while others enforce it represents an inconsistent implementation of the class's implicit contract. Users would reasonably expect all removal operations to behave consistently.

### Conclusion:

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that default keys must be protected, the implementation clearly shows this intent through the `__delitem__` override. The bug is a genuine implementation inconsistency rather than a documentation issue.
