# Bug Triage Analysis

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The function returns negative values for length, which violates the fundamental mathematical property that length is non-negative
- The docstring states it should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- When you actually perform `len(target[indexer])` in NumPy, you always get non-negative values
- The function is clearly intended to predict the length of an indexing operation
- Multiple test cases demonstrate the mismatch between computed and actual lengths
- The behavior is inconsistent with user expectations and the semantic meaning of "length"

**Evidence:**
- `slice(1, 0, None)` returns -1 but `len(array[slice(1, 0, None)])` returns 0
- `slice(None, None, -1)` returns negative values but should return positive length of reversed array
- No documentation suggests negative values have special meaning

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue the function works as designed internally for pandas' purposes
- Maybe negative values have some internal meaning not exposed in public API

**Counter-evidence:**
- The function is documented and its docstring makes clear promises
- No documentation suggests negative values are intentional
- The fix is straightforward (add `max(0, ...)`)

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The function might be internal-only and not meant for public use
- Could be legacy code that pandas maintains for backward compatibility

**Counter-evidence:**
- The function is actively used within pandas codebase
- Returning incorrect lengths could cause array allocation issues or other bugs
- The bug affects correctness, not just performance or style

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Perhaps the documentation should clarify that negative values can be returned
- Maybe "expected length" has a different meaning than actual length

**Counter-evidence:**
- The documentation clearly states it returns "the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Changing documentation to allow negative lengths would be nonsensical
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that handling edge cases properly is a new feature

**Counter-evidence:**
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The function already exists and has documented behavior
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding features

## Analysis Summary

The strongest case is for **BUG**. The function `length_of_indexer` is documented to return "the expected length of target[indexer]", but it returns negative values in several cases where the actual length (from `len(target[indexer])`) is non-negative.

Key points:
1. **Length is inherently non-negative** - This is a fundamental property in mathematics and programming
2. **Documentation mismatch** - The function claims to return expected length but doesn't match actual length
3. **Clear reproducible cases** - Multiple test cases show the discrepancy
4. **Simple fix available** - The proposed fix (`max(0, ...)`) is minimal and correct
5. **Potential for downstream bugs** - Incorrect length calculations could cause issues in code that uses this function

This is not a documentation issue (the docs are clear), not a missing feature (the function exists), and not trivial (length calculation is fundamental to array operations).
