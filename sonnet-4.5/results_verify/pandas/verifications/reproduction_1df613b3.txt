## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report has been successfully reproduced. The `pandas.plotting.autocorrelation_plot` function does indeed trigger a RuntimeWarning for division by zero when processing a constant series.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Property-Based Test**:
   - The test failed as expected with the message "autocorrelation_plot should not raise warnings for constant=0.0"
   - This confirms that the function generates warnings for any constant value

2. **Simple Reproduction Test**:
   - Testing with `pd.Series([5.0] * 20)`: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in scalar divide
   - Testing with `pd.Series([0.0] * 20)`: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in scalar divide
   - Both constant series trigger the same division by zero warning

### Code Analysis
Examining the source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/misc.py`:

- Line 454: `c0 = np.sum((data - mean) ** 2) / n` calculates the variance
- Line 457: `return ((data[: n - h] - mean) * (data[h:] - mean)).sum() / n / c0` divides by c0

For a constant series:
1. All values are identical
2. The mean equals the constant value
3. `(data - mean)` produces an array of zeros
4. `c0` (variance) becomes 0
5. Division by `c0` in the `r(h)` function causes division by zero
6. This produces NaN values and triggers a RuntimeWarning

### Effect
The bug manifests as:
1. A RuntimeWarning is raised during execution
2. The resulting autocorrelation values are NaN (not a number)
3. The plot still generates but contains invalid data points
4. No clear error message explains what went wrong to the user

The behavior is consistent and reproducible for any constant series regardless of the constant value used.
