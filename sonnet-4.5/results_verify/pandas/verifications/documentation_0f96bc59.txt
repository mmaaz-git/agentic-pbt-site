DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

After reviewing the documentation and source code for FixedForwardWindowIndexer:

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
   - The pandas documentation shows that FixedForwardWindowIndexer creates "window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
   - The parameter window_size is described as defining "the fixed-length forward window"
   - Example shows window_size=2 creates a forward-looking window

2. PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS:
   - The window_size parameter type is specified as 'int' in the signature
   - No explicit documentation states that negative values are prohibited
   - No documentation specifies what should happen with negative window_size values
   - The BaseIndexer class (parent class) also just specifies window_size: int = 0

3. CODE BEHAVIOR:
   - The implementation in lines 340-345 shows:
     * start = np.arange(0, num_values, step, dtype="int64")
     * end = start + self.window_size
     * If window_size is non-zero, end is clipped to [0, num_values]
   - The clipping only happens when window_size is non-zero (line 342-343)
   - The code does not validate that window_size should be non-negative

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   - Based on the name "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" and the description, it's clear this is meant for forward-looking windows
   - Negative window sizes would mean looking backward, which contradicts the "Forward" in the name
   - The example and documentation imply window_size should be positive

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly state that negative window_size values are invalid, but:
- The semantic meaning of "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" strongly implies non-negative values
- The current implementation doesn't handle negative values correctly
- The lack of input validation is a gap in the implementation
