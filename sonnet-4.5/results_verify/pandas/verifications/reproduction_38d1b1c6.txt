## Reproduction Results

### Test Environment
- Platform: Linux
- Python version: 3.13.2
- pandas location: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/

### Bug Reproduction Confirmed

The bug report is technically accurate. When attempting to instantiate `PyperclipWindowsException` on Linux (or any non-Windows platform), an `AttributeError` is raised:

```
AttributeError: module 'ctypes' has no attribute 'WinError'
```

This occurs at line 637 in `/pandas/errors/__init__.py`:
```python
message += f" ({ctypes.WinError()})"  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
```

### Key Findings

1. **The bug exists**: `ctypes.WinError()` is indeed Windows-only and does not exist on Linux/macOS.

2. **The code acknowledges this**: The comment on line 636 states "# attr only exists on Windows, so typing fails on other platforms"

3. **Type ignore is used**: The code uses `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` to suppress type checking errors.

4. **Instantiation fails**: Any attempt to create a `PyperclipWindowsException` instance on non-Windows platforms will crash.

### Important Context

However, there are several important considerations:

1. **Exception Purpose**: This exception is specifically designed for Windows clipboard errors. The name itself indicates Windows-specificity.

2. **Typical Usage Pattern**: This exception would typically be:
   - Raised by pandas internally when Windows clipboard operations fail
   - Caught in exception handlers
   - Not manually instantiated by users

3. **Cross-platform Code**: While the exception class can be imported on all platforms (for use in except clauses), instantiation only happens when the exception is raised, which would only occur on Windows.

The bug is real from a technical perspective - the code does crash when instantiated on non-Windows platforms. However, the practical impact depends on whether this exception is ever meant to be instantiated on non-Windows systems.
