## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Failure
The hypothesis test failed as expected with the exact input mentioned in the bug report:
- Input: strings=['0'], start=None, stop=None, repl=''
- The test expected: '0' + '' + '0' = '00'
- But got: ''

### Manual Reproduction Results
I created additional test cases to understand the behavior:

1. With string '0' and empty replacement:
   - Result: '' (empty string)
   - Expected: '00' (based on Python's None slicing behavior)

2. With string 'hello' and empty replacement:
   - Result: '' (empty string)
   - Expected: 'hellohello'

3. With string 'hello' and replacement 'REPLACEMENT':
   - Result: 'REPLACEMENT'
   - Expected: 'helloREPLACEMENThello'

### Python's None Slicing Behavior
I verified that Python's built-in slicing with None boundaries works as described:
- '0'[:None] returns '0' (the full string)
- '0'[None:] returns '0' (the full string)
- '0'[:None] + '' + '0'[None:] equals '00'

### Code Analysis
Looking at the implementation in lines 347-364 of object_array.py, the issue is clear:

```python
def _str_slice_replace(self, start=None, stop=None, repl=None):
    # ...
    def f(x):
        # ...
        y = ""
        if start is not None:  # This check is the problem
            y += x[:start]
        y += repl
        if stop is not None:  # This check is also the problem
            y += x[local_stop:]
        return y
```

The code only includes the portions of the string outside the slice boundaries when start/stop are not None. However, in Python, None is a valid slice boundary that means "use the default" (beginning or end of the string).

The bug is confirmed and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
