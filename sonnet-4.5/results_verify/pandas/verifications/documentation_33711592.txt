DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Function Documentation Review

The function `pandas.core.dtypes.inference.is_re_compilable` has the following documentation:

### Docstring (from source code):
- **Purpose**: "Check if the object can be compiled into a regex pattern instance."
- **Parameters**: obj - The object to check
- **Returns**: bool - Whether `obj` can be compiled as a regex pattern
- **Examples**: Shows returning True for valid regex ".*" and False for integer 1

### Official Pandas Documentation:
The online documentation confirms the same behavior - the function should check if an object "can be compiled" into a regex pattern and return a boolean value.

## Key Documentation Points:

1. **Clear Return Type**: The documentation explicitly states the function returns a `bool` value.

2. **Purpose is Clear**: The function should check if something CAN BE compiled, implying it should handle cases where compilation fails gracefully.

3. **No Exception Documentation**: Neither the docstring nor the online documentation mentions that this function might raise exceptions. Functions that are checkers/validators typically don't raise exceptions - they return True/False.

4. **Semantic Intent**: The function name "is_re_compilable" and its documentation strongly suggest a boolean predicate function that answers "can this be compiled?" not "try to compile this and crash if it fails."

5. **Examples Don't Cover Edge Cases**: The provided examples only show a valid regex pattern and a non-string type. They don't demonstrate behavior with invalid regex patterns.

## Conclusion:

Based on the documentation, the function should return `False` for ANY object that cannot be compiled into a regex pattern, including:
- Non-string objects (currently handled via TypeError)
- Invalid regex patterns (NOT currently handled - causes crash)

The current implementation violates the documented contract by raising exceptions instead of returning False for invalid regex patterns.
