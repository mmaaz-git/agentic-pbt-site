BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

Test Case Results:

1. German ß Character Test:
   - Input: 'ß' (length 1)
   - Output: 'SS' (length 2)
   - The bug report is CORRECT that the function changes string length
   - Python's 'ß'.upper() returns 'SS' (this is standard Unicode behavior)
   - The implementation s[:1].upper() + s[1:] produces 'SS' + '' = 'SS'

2. Property Tests from Bug Report:
   a) test_rest_unchanged: FAILS for 'ß'
      - Expects result[1:] == s[1:]
      - For 'ß': result[1:] = 'S' but s[1:] = ''
      - This property violation is CONFIRMED

   b) test_first_char_uppercase: FAILS for 'ß'
      - Expects result[0] == s[0].upper()
      - For 'ß': result[0] = 'S' but s[0].upper() = 'SS'
      - This test expectation is INCORRECT - it should be testing the whole first character transformation

3. Normal ASCII Text:
   - 'hello' -> 'Hello' (works correctly)
   - 'Test' -> 'Test' (works correctly)
   - '123' -> '123' (works correctly)
   - Empty string '' -> '' (works correctly)

4. Mixed Unicode Test:
   - 'ßtest' -> 'SStest'
   - Length changes from 5 to 6
   - result[1:] = 'Stest' != s[1:] = 'test'

Technical Analysis:
- The issue is real: German ß uppercases to SS in Unicode
- This is standard Unicode case mapping (not a Python bug)
- Other affected characters exist (e.g., certain ligatures)
- The function works perfectly for ASCII characters
- The actual internal usage (PeriodDtype) only uses ASCII strings

Bug Report Accuracy:
- The technical details in the bug report are ACCURATE
- The reproduction code works as described
- The length change for ß is confirmed
- The property violations are real for Unicode edge cases
