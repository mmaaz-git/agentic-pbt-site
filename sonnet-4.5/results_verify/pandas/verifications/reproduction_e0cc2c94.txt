REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Bug Report Verification

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is real and behaves exactly as described.

## Test Results

### 1. Testing with invalid regex patterns (strings that cannot compile):

- `is_re_compilable('[')` raises `PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0`
- `is_re_compilable('?')` raises `PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0`
- `is_re_compilable('(unclosed')` raises `PatternError: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0`

All of these raise `re.PatternError` exceptions instead of returning `False`.

### 2. Testing with valid inputs:

- `is_re_compilable('abc')` returns `True` (valid regex pattern)
- `is_re_compilable(123)` returns `False` (integer, not a string)

These work as expected according to the documentation.

## Source Code Analysis

The current implementation of `is_re_compilable` in pandas/core/dtypes/inference.py is:

```python
def is_re_compilable(obj) -> bool:
    try:
        re.compile(obj)
    except TypeError:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

The function only catches `TypeError` (which handles non-string types like integers), but does not catch `re.PatternError` (or more generally `re.error`), which is raised when a string is not a valid regex pattern.

## Conclusion

The bug is confirmed. The function raises exceptions for invalid regex pattern strings instead of returning `False` as its documentation and signature promise. The function name "is_re_compilable" strongly suggests it should return a boolean indicating whether the object can be compiled as a regex, not raise an exception for invalid patterns.
