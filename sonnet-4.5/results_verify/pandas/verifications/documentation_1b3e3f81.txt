DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer

FUNCTION PURPOSE:
The function `length_of_indexer` is documented with a concise docstring that states it should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]". The return type is specified as `int` in the type annotation.

KEY DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:

1. FUNCTION LOCATION AND STATUS:
   - The function is located in pandas.core.indexers.utils module
   - This is part of pandas' PRIVATE internal modules (pandas.core.*)
   - According to pandas documentation, stable functionality in private modules is not guaranteed
   - The function is not part of the public API and has no official public documentation

2. DOCUMENTED CONTRACT:
   - The function's docstring explicitly states it returns "the expected length of target[indexer]"
   - The return type annotation specifies -> int
   - No documentation mentions that negative values are acceptable return values
   - The fundamental mathematical concept of "length" implies non-negative values

3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   - For any valid indexer, the function should return the count of elements that would be selected
   - A length is inherently a non-negative quantity representing a count
   - The function should behave consistently with Python's len() function behavior on sliced sequences

4. SLICE HANDLING:
   - No documentation specifies special handling for negative step slices
   - Python's standard slice behavior with negative steps is well-established
   - slice(None, None, -1) reverses a sequence, yielding the same number of elements

5. COMPARISON WITH PYTHON STANDARD:
   - Python's built-in slice.indices() method properly handles all slice edge cases
   - The len(range(*slice.indices(len))) pattern is the standard way to compute slice lengths
   - This pattern always returns non-negative values for valid slices

CONCLUSION:
The documentation clearly indicates the function should return "the expected length" as an integer. While sparse, this documentation combined with the fundamental mathematical definition of "length" as a non-negative quantity establishes that returning negative values violates the documented contract. The function's behavior should match what Python developers would expect from standard slice operations.
