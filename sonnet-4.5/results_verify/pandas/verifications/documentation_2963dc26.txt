## Documentation Analysis

I have reviewed the relevant documentation for pandas categorical data handling and the dataframe interchange protocol.

### Pandas Categorical Documentation
The pandas documentation clearly establishes that:
1. Missing values in categorical data are represented by the sentinel value -1 in the codes array
2. The `from_codes` constructor explicitly states that -1 represents NaN/missing data
3. This is the standard and documented behavior across pandas: codes of -1 always mean missing values

### Dataframe Interchange Protocol
The interchange protocol specification defines:
1. Columns can describe their null representation via `describe_null()`
2. One supported null type is `USE_SENTINEL` where a specific value indicates missing data
3. For pandas categoricals with missing values, the protocol correctly reports USE_SENTINEL with value -1

### Expected Behavior
Based on the documentation:
1. Categorical columns with -1 codes should preserve missing values when converted through the interchange protocol
2. The -1 sentinel values should be converted to NaN/missing values in the resulting DataFrame
3. Data integrity should be maintained - missing values should remain missing

### Actual Behavior
The current implementation violates the documented behavior:
1. Missing values (code -1) are converted to actual category values
2. The interchange protocol's null handling mechanism is bypassed
3. Data is silently corrupted without any warning or error

The bug report correctly identifies a violation of documented pandas behavior and the interchange protocol specification. The conversion should preserve missing values as defined by both pandas categorical documentation and the interchange protocol's USE_SENTINEL mechanism.
