## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Strong Arguments For:**
1. The Scanner enters a genuine infinite loop that hangs the program
2. Rep() and Opt() are documented, supported patterns that should work
3. The behavior is inconsistent - Rep1() handles non-matching input correctly by raising UnrecognizedInput
4. Other lexer generators handle nullable patterns without infinite loops
5. The bug makes fundamental regex operations unusable in practice
6. Resource exhaustion (CPU and memory) is a serious production issue
7. The fix is straightforward - detect zero-width matches and ensure forward progress

**Arguments Against:**
- None found; this is clearly broken behavior

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that nullable patterns in a lexicon are inherently problematic
- User might be misusing the library by putting Rep() directly in a lexicon

**Strong Arguments Against:**
1. Rep() and Opt() are explicitly documented as valid patterns
2. The documentation shows no warnings against using them in lexicons
3. The patterns are part of the public API
4. No documentation says these patterns shouldn't be used with Scanner
5. The infinite loop is clearly unintended behavior

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments For:**
- Could be considered an edge case if nullable patterns are rarely used at the top level

**Strong Arguments Against:**
1. This affects core functionality - Rep() and Opt() are fundamental regex operations
2. The bug causes programs to hang completely, not just perform poorly
3. It's not an obscure edge case - any non-matching input triggers it
4. The impact is severe (infinite loop, resource exhaustion)

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that proper handling of nullable patterns is a "new feature"
- The Scanner never claimed to handle zero-width matches correctly

**Strong Arguments Against:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. Rep() and Opt() are already part of the API - they should work correctly
3. An infinite loop is a bug, not a missing feature
4. Other parts of the system (Rep1) handle similar situations correctly

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation doesn't specify how zero-width matches should be handled
- Could document that nullable patterns shouldn't be used in lexicons

**Strong Arguments Against:**
1. The code behavior (infinite loop) is clearly wrong regardless of documentation
2. Documenting "don't use Rep() or Opt()" would be removing advertised functionality
3. The issue is with the implementation, not the documentation
4. Even if documented as a limitation, the infinite loop is still a bug

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The Scanner enters an infinite loop when using documented, public API patterns (Rep and Opt) with non-matching input. The behavior is:
1. Reproducible and consistent
2. Causes program hangs and resource exhaustion
3. Inconsistent with how non-nullable patterns (Rep1) behave
4. Not warned against in documentation
5. Affects core regex functionality

The fact that the documentation doesn't explicitly specify how zero-width matches should be handled doesn't make this behavior acceptable. An infinite loop is never the correct behavior for a lexer, especially when the patterns causing it are part of the public API.
