## Documentation Analysis

### Official Pandas Documentation

1. **read_json Documentation**:
   - States that "Compatible JSON strings can be produced by to_json() with a corresponding orient value"
   - Does NOT explicitly guarantee perfect round-trip compatibility
   - Does NOT mention int64 limitations or integer overflow issues
   - Lists known limitations only for specific orient formats (e.g., index name issues with orient='table')

2. **to_json Documentation**:
   - Does NOT mention any limitations on integer value ranges
   - Does NOT warn about potential round-trip failures with large integers
   - Focuses on format options, date handling, and floating-point precision
   - No mention of ujson's int64 limitations

3. **Round-Trip Compatibility**:
   - The documentation suggests compatibility but does NOT guarantee it
   - Multiple GitHub issues (found via search) show known round-trip problems:
     * Issue #22525: Round trip json serialization issues
     * Issue #32037: JSON table orient not roundtripping extension types
     * Issue #44705: Date/time objects not roundtripping
     * Issue #50456: MultiIndex round-trip failures
   - There is no formal round-trip guarantee in the documentation

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **Missing Integer Range Warning**: Neither function documents the int64 limitation, despite ujson being the underlying implementation

2. **Incomplete Compatibility Statement**: The phrase "Compatible JSON strings can be produced" is misleading as it implies full compatibility without stating limitations

3. **No Data Type Limitations Section**: The documentation lacks a clear section on data type limitations for JSON serialization

### External References
- No external standards (like JSON RFC) are violated, as JSON itself supports arbitrary precision numbers
- The limitation is specific to pandas' implementation choice (ujson)

### Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly guarantee round-trip compatibility and has multiple known issues. However, the documentation's wording strongly suggests compatibility ("Compatible JSON strings can be produced by to_json()"), which creates a reasonable expectation that data written with to_json() should be readable with read_json(). The complete absence of warnings about integer range limitations is a documentation gap.
