## Documentation Analysis for convert_to_line_delimits

### Function Location and Nature
- The function `convert_to_line_delimits` is located in `pandas.io.json._normalize` module
- It appears to be an internal/private helper function (in the _normalize module with underscore prefix)
- The function is not publicly documented in pandas' official API documentation

### Function Documentation
The only documentation found is the docstring in the source code:
```
Helper function that converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON.
```

### Key Observations
1. **Minimal Documentation**: The docstring is extremely brief - only stating it "converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON"
2. **No Parameter Documentation**: The docstring doesn't describe what the input parameter `s` should be
3. **No Return Value Documentation**: The docstring doesn't describe what is returned
4. **No Behavior Specification**: The docstring doesn't specify:
   - What happens with non-JSON input
   - What happens with malformed JSON
   - What happens with JSON objects (not arrays)
   - What the expected format of input strings should be

### Code Comment Analysis
The inline comment in the code states:
```python
# Determine we have a JSON list to turn to lines otherwise just return the
# json object, only lists can
```
This comment suggests the function should:
- Check if input is a JSON list (array)
- If it's a list, convert it to line-delimited format
- If it's not a list, return it unchanged

### Intended Behavior (Based on Code Structure)
Looking at the function implementation, it appears the intent is:
1. Check if the string represents a JSON array (starts with '[' and ends with ']')
2. If yes, strip the brackets and convert to line-delimited format
3. If no, return the original string unchanged

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not specify:
- Whether the input must be valid JSON
- How the function should handle strings that look like JSON arrays but aren't valid JSON
- Whether partial JSON arrays (like "[abc" or "abc]") should be processed or returned unchanged
- The exact criteria for determining if something is a "JSON list"
