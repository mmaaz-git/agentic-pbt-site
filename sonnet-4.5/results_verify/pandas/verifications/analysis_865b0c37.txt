## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**

1. **Undocumented behavior**: The documentation never mentions that `remove_categories` will sort remaining categories for unordered categoricals.

2. **Counterintuitive logic**: The code treats ordered and unordered categoricals oppositely:
   - Ordered (where order matters): Preserves order (sort=False)
   - Unordered (where order "doesn't matter"): Sorts alphabetically (sort=True)
   This is backwards - if anything, one would expect consistent behavior or the reverse.

3. **Violates principle of least surprise**: Method named "remove_categories" should only remove, not reorder.

4. **Breaks round-trip property**: `add_categories(x).remove_categories(x)` doesn't return to original state.

5. **Inconsistent with other operations**: Other pandas operations generally preserve insertion order since Python 3.7+ guarantees dict ordering.

6. **Source code comment confirms it's unintentional**: The comment "# sort=True by default!" suggests the developer knew this was happening by default, not by design.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Weak arguments against:**

1. Could argue that "unordered" means order doesn't matter, so sorting is acceptable.
   - Counter: "unordered" refers to comparison operations, not list structure
   - Counter: Even unordered sets in pandas maintain insertion order

2. The behavior is consistent (always sorts unordered).
   - Counter: Consistently wrong is still wrong

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**

1. Existing code may depend on this behavior.
   - Counter: This is a breaking change worth fixing for correctness

2. Performance might be better with sorting.
   - Counter: Actually worse - sorting adds unnecessary O(n log n) operation

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**

1. If this were intentional design, documentation should clarify it.
   - Counter: The behavior makes no logical sense to be intentional

2. Documentation could be updated to warn about this.
   - Counter: Better to fix the bug than document broken behavior

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it's not a feature request:**

1. This is not asking for new functionality.
2. The expected behavior (preserving order) is the natural behavior.
3. The current behavior appears to be a bug, not a missing feature.

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**:

1. The behavior is undocumented and unexpected
2. It violates the principle that a "remove" operation should only remove
3. The logic is backwards (sorts when unordered, preserves when ordered)
4. It breaks reasonable invariants like round-trip properties
5. The source code suggests this is an oversight (default parameter behavior)
6. The fix is trivial and makes the code more consistent

The fact that ordered categoricals preserve order while unordered ones don't strongly suggests this is unintended behavior rather than deliberate design. The documentation gives no hint that this should happen, and the method name itself ("remove_categories") implies only removal, not reordering.
