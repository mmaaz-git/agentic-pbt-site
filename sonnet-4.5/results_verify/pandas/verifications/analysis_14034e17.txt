## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The pandas test suite itself (test_optional_dependency.py, lines 62-65) explicitly tests that import_optional_dependency returns None when errors='ignore' and the version is too old. This is an intentional, tested behavior, not a bug. The implementation is working exactly as designed and tested. The usage pattern in the codebase (e.g., frame.py line 1443-1445) relies on checking if the return value is None to determine whether to proceed, which is consistent with returning None for old versions. The bug reporter is misinterpreting one line of the docstring while ignoring the contradictory line and the actual intended behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The docstring does contain the phrase "return the module, even if the version is too old" at line 111, which could reasonably be interpreted to mean the module should be returned. If a user reads only this part of the documentation, they would expect the module to be returned.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Even if there's some confusion in the documentation, the current behavior is deeply embedded in the codebase and test suite. Changing it would break existing code that relies on None being returned. The issue is primarily about documentation clarity rather than incorrect functionality. The behavior has been this way for a long time and users have adapted to it.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Documentation clarity is important, and if there's genuine confusion about the expected behavior, it should be addressed rather than ignored. The function is part of the public API (even if in a compat module) and its behavior should be clearly specified.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The docstring contains an internal contradiction - line 111 says "return the module, even if the version is too old" while lines 122-123 say "None is returned when the package's version is too old and errors is 'ignore'". This contradiction needs to be resolved. The actual behavior (returning None) is what's implemented, tested, and used throughout the codebase, so the documentation at line 111 should be corrected to match reality. This would resolve all confusion without breaking any existing code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The bug reporter might argue that the documentation at line 111 represents the original intent and the implementation is wrong. However, given that the tests explicitly verify the current behavior, it's clear the implementation is intentional.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The behavior requested by the bug reporter (returning the module even with an old version when errors='ignore') could be seen as a new feature. It would allow users to access modules with old versions and handle version checking themselves. This could be useful in some scenarios where users want more control over version validation.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug reporter isn't asking for new functionality but claiming the existing functionality is broken. They believe this is how it should already work based on their interpretation of the documentation. Additionally, changing this behavior would be a breaking change, not a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation explicitly states at line 111 that when errors='ignore', the function should "return the module, even if the version is too old." The current implementation violates this documented contract by returning None instead. The proposed fix is simple and would make the code match this part of the documentation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The test suite explicitly verifies that None should be returned when errors='ignore' and version is too old (test_optional_dependency.py lines 62-65). The existing codebase depends on this behavior (e.g., frame.py checks for None). The documentation itself is contradictory, with lines 122-123 stating None should be returned. The implementation, tests, and usage all agree that None should be returned - only one line of documentation disagrees.

## Overall Consideration

After thorough investigation, this bug report should be classified as DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The core issue is an internal contradiction in the docstring, not a bug in the implementation. The evidence overwhelmingly supports that the current behavior (returning None) is intentional:

1. The test suite explicitly tests for and expects None to be returned when errors='ignore' and version is too old
2. Multiple places in the pandas codebase rely on this behavior
3. The documentation itself is contradictory, with one part saying return the module and another saying return None

The line stating "return the module, even if the version is too old" appears to be an error in the documentation that contradicts both the implementation and the rest of the documentation. The correct behavior is to return None, as stated in lines 122-123 of the docstring, implemented in the code, verified by tests, and relied upon by other parts of pandas. The documentation should be fixed to remove this contradiction and clearly state that None is returned when the version is too old, regardless of the errors parameter value.
