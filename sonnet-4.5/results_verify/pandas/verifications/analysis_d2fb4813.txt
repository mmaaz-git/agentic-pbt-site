## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- Violates Python's fundamental hash-equality contract: if a == b, then hash(a) must equal hash(b)
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects all ExtensionDtype subclasses
- Can cause real bugs in production code when using dtypes in dictionaries or sets
- The violation is in core functionality, not some rarely-used feature
- Python's data model documentation explicitly requires this invariant
- The bug affects pandas' built-in dtypes (CategoricalDtype, PeriodDtype, IntervalDtype, etc.)

**Arguments Against:**
- The string equality feature is documented and intentional
- Could be considered a design choice rather than a bug

#### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The __eq__ behavior with strings is explicitly documented
- The feature works as documented (strings do compare equal to dtypes)

**Arguments Against:**
- Violating Python's hash-equality contract is never "working as intended"
- This is not about undocumented behavior - it's about violating Python's core requirements
- Even if string comparison is intentional, the hash implementation is objectively incorrect

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Fixing this might break backward compatibility
- Users may rely on the current string comparison behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental contract violation
- The bug can cause silent failures in real applications
- This affects core functionality, not some trivial feature

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that proper hash-equality support is a "new feature"

**Arguments Against:**
- Hash-equality contract is a Python requirement, not an optional feature
- The current implementation is broken, not merely missing functionality

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation could be updated to warn about this limitation
- Could document that dtypes and strings shouldn't be used interchangeably as dict keys

**Arguments Against:**
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
- Python's hash-equality contract is non-negotiable

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation violates Python's fundamental hash-equality contract, which states that equal objects must have equal hash values. This is not a matter of opinion or design choice - it's a core Python requirement that ensures correct behavior of hash-based collections.

The fact that string comparison is documented doesn't excuse the hash violation. If pandas wants to support `dtype == string`, then it must also ensure `hash(dtype) == hash(string)` when they are equal, or remove the string comparison feature entirely.

The bug is:
1. **Correctness issue**: Violates Python's data model
2. **Not trivial**: Affects all ExtensionDtype subclasses
3. **Has real impact**: Can cause dictionary/set lookup failures
4. **Has clear fix**: Either update __hash__ or remove string comparison from __eq__
