BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
===================================

## Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)

**Strong Evidence:**
1. The function explicitly guarantees uniqueness preservation in its docstring
2. The bug violates this documented guarantee with concrete examples
3. The function produces invalid output ('inf%', 'nan%') for valid inputs in [0,1]
4. The inputs causing the issue are within the documented valid range [0,1]
5. The failure is deterministic and reproducible
6. The bug causes runtime warnings indicating numerical instability
7. The proposed fix is reasonable and addresses the root cause

**Assessment:** This is a clear BUG. The function fails to meet its explicitly documented contract.

## Consideration for WONTFIX

**Potential Arguments:**
1. The failing values (2.225e-309, 5e-324) are denormalized floating-point numbers near the limits of float64 precision
2. Such extreme values might never occur in practical use cases
3. The uniqueness guarantee might be considered "best effort" within reasonable precision limits

**Assessment:** While the values are extreme, they are still valid floats in [0,1]. The docstring makes no exception for extreme values. This is NOT a WONTFIX case because the function should handle all valid inputs gracefully.

## Consideration for INVALID

**Potential Arguments:**
1. Could argue that denormalized numbers near zero are edge cases outside normal use
2. Might claim the uniqueness guarantee has implicit precision limitations

**Assessment:** The documentation explicitly states the guarantee without exceptions. The inputs are valid according to the documented constraints. This is NOT INVALID.

## Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Potential Arguments:**
1. The documentation could be updated to acknowledge precision limitations
2. Could add a note that extremely small differences may not be preserved
3. The implementation works correctly for "normal" percentile values

**Assessment:** While updating documentation is an option, the current behavior produces completely invalid outputs ('inf%', 'nan%') which is unacceptable regardless of documentation. This is more than a documentation issue.

## Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Potential Arguments:**
1. Supporting extreme precision for denormalized numbers could be seen as a new feature
2. Better handling of edge cases might be considered an enhancement

**Assessment:** This is NOT a feature request. The function already claims to handle all values in [0,1] and preserve uniqueness. This is about fixing existing broken functionality.

## FINAL DECISION

This is unequivocally a **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Contract Violation**: The function explicitly guarantees uniqueness preservation, which it fails to deliver
2. **Invalid Output**: Producing 'inf%' and 'nan%' strings is objectively incorrect behavior
3. **Valid Input Range**: All test inputs are within the documented valid range [0,1]
4. **Deterministic Failure**: The bug is reproducible and not random
5. **Reasonable Fix Available**: The proposed solution (capping precision) is sensible and maintains functionality

The bug report is well-documented, includes reproducible test cases, identifies the root cause correctly, and proposes a reasonable fix. This is a textbook example of a valid bug that should be fixed.
