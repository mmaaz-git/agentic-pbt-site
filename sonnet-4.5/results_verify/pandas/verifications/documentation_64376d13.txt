## Documentation Analysis for import_optional_dependency

Based on examining the source code and documentation, here's what I found:

### Function Signature and Documentation
The function `import_optional_dependency` is defined in pandas/compat/_optional.py with the following docstring:

```
Import an optional dependency.

By default, if a dependency is missing an ImportError with a nice
message will be raised. If a dependency is present, but too old,
we raise.

Parameters
----------
name : str
    The module name.
extra : str
    Additional text to include in the ImportError message.
errors : str {'raise', 'warn', 'ignore'}
    What to do when a dependency is not found or its version is too old.

    * raise : Raise an ImportError
    * warn : Only applicable when a module's version is to old.
      Warns that the version is too old and returns None
    * ignore: If the module is not installed, return None, otherwise,
      return the module, even if the version is too old.
      It's expected that users validate the version locally when
      using ``errors="ignore"`` (see. ``io/html.py``)
min_version : str, default None
    Specify a minimum version that is different from the global pandas
    minimum version required.
Returns
-------
maybe_module : Optional[ModuleType]
    The imported module, when found and the version is correct.
    None is returned when the package is not found and `errors`
    is False, or when the package's version is too old and `errors`
    is ``'warn'`` or ``'ignore'``.
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **For `errors='ignore'` behavior**:
   - Documentation states: "If the module is not installed, return None, otherwise, return the module, even if the version is too old."
   - This clearly specifies that when `errors='ignore'`, the function should return the module even if version checking fails or the version is too old.
   - It explicitly notes that users are expected to validate versions locally when using `errors='ignore'`.

2. **For `errors='warn'` behavior**:
   - Documentation states: "Only applicable when a module's version is to old. Warns that the version is too old and returns None"
   - This indicates that `errors='warn'` should warn and return None, not raise an exception.

3. **The get_version helper function**:
   - Looking at line 74-82, the `get_version` function raises an `ImportError` with message "Can't determine version for {module.__name__}" if it cannot find a `__version__` attribute.
   - This is an internal helper function not exposed in the public API.

### Documentation vs Implementation Issue

The bug report claims that when `errors='ignore'` or `errors='warn'` is used with a module that doesn't have a determinable version (like 'sys'), the function raises an ImportError instead of handling it gracefully as documented.

Looking at the implementation (lines 149-150), when a minimum_version is specified, the code calls `get_version(module_to_get)` directly without any exception handling. The `get_version` function can raise an ImportError at line 78 if the module doesn't have a `__version__` attribute.

The documentation clearly states that:
- With `errors='ignore'`: should return the module even if version is too old (or in this case, undeterminable)
- With `errors='warn'`: should warn and return None, not raise

The current implementation doesn't handle the case where `get_version` raises an ImportError before the `errors` parameter can be evaluated. This appears to be a violation of the documented contract.
