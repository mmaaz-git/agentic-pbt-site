Documentation Analysis for pandas.io.sas.sas7bdat._convert_datetimes

From reviewing the source code and documentation:

1. The function _convert_datetimes is an internal function (indicated by the leading underscore) in the pandas library.

2. The function's docstring states:
   - It converts SAS datetimes to Timestamp if possible, otherwise to datetime.datetime
   - It accepts a Series or Sequence[float] as sas_datetimes
   - The unit parameter can be 'd' for dates or 's' for datetimes
   - It returns a Series of datetime64 dtype or datetime.datetime

3. The docstring explicitly mentions "SAS float64 lacks precision for more than ms resolution so the fit to datetime.datetime is ok."

4. There is NO documentation about:
   - What constitutes valid input ranges
   - How the function should handle values that exceed datetime limits
   - What exceptions might be raised
   - Whether extremely large values are expected or should be handled

5. The public pandas.read_sas() documentation (which would call this internal function) does not document any limitations on datetime values that can be read from SAS files.

6. This is an internal function (starts with underscore), so it's not part of the public API. Users would not directly call this function - it's called internally when reading SAS files.

7. The function uses pandas' cast_from_unit_vectorized which has its own datetime limits (roughly -9223372036 to 9223372036 seconds from Unix epoch for proper datetime64 conversion).

8. Pandas timestamps have well-defined min/max values (1677-09-21 to 2262-04-11), but this is not mentioned in the _convert_datetimes documentation.

The documentation does not specify behavior for out-of-range values, making this somewhat ambiguous territory for bug classification.
