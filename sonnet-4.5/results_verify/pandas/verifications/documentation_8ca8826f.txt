DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing the pandas documentation, I found the following relevant information:

1. PANDAS ROLLING.MEAN() DOCUMENTATION:
   The official documentation for pandas.core.window.rolling.Rolling.mean() describes it as calculating the rolling mean over a specified window. The documentation states that it returns values with np.float64 dtype.

2. CRITICAL FINDING - NUMERICAL PRECISION WARNING:
   The pandas user guide for windowing operations (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/window.html) contains an explicit warning about numerical precision issues:

   "Some windowing aggregation, mean, sum, var and std methods may suffer from numerical imprecision due to the underlying windowing algorithms accumulating sums."

   The documentation specifically states:
   - "Kahan summation is used to compute the rolling sums to preserve accuracy as much as possible."
   - "When values differ with magnitude 1/np.finfo(np.double).eps this results in truncation."

3. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION PROMISES:
   - The rolling mean should calculate the arithmetic mean of values in each window
   - It uses Kahan summation for improved accuracy
   - It acknowledges potential numerical imprecision issues

4. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT SPECIFY:
   - No explicit guarantee about maintaining mathematical invariants (e.g., mean within min/max bounds)
   - No specific behavior documented for subnormal numbers
   - No accuracy requirements or error bounds specified
   - No warning about 100% relative errors being possible

5. MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATION:
   While not explicitly stated in the documentation, the mathematical definition of "mean" implies that it should be the arithmetic average of the window values. A mean that falls outside the [min, max] bounds of its inputs violates the fundamental mathematical definition of mean, regardless of whether the documentation explicitly states this.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation acknowledges that numerical imprecision can occur, but the severity observed (100% relative error, violation of mathematical bounds) goes beyond what would be considered acceptable "numerical imprecision." The function is not computing a mean in any meaningful mathematical sense for these inputs.
