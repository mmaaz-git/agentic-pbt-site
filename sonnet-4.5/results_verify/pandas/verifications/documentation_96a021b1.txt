DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Official Documentation Review:

   Both `hash_pandas_object` and `hash_array` have similar documentation:

   - Parameter description: "hash_key : str, default _default_hash_key. Hash_key for string key to encode."
   - No mention of 16-byte requirement
   - Default value shown as '0123456789123456' (which is 16 bytes)
   - No warnings, notes, or constraints mentioned about hash_key length

2. Source Code Comments:

   - Line 43 in hashing.py has comment: "# 16 byte long hashing key"
   - Default key defined as: _default_hash_key = "0123456789123456"
   - This comment suggests the developers knew about the 16-byte requirement
   - But this requirement was never added to the public-facing documentation

3. Implementation Details:

   - The actual validation happens in the Cython code (pandas/_libs/hashing.pyx)
   - Error message: "key should be a 16-byte string encoded, got b'{key}' (len {actual_len})"
   - This error only triggers for object dtype data
   - Other dtypes (int64, float64, bool, datetime64) don't enforce this requirement

4. Documentation vs Implementation Mismatch:

   - Documentation says: "hash_key : str" - implies any string is acceptable
   - Implementation requires: exactly 16 bytes when encoded (but only for object dtypes)
   - No documentation explains why object dtypes have different requirements
   - Users cannot know this requirement without hitting the error

5. User Expectations:

   - Users would reasonably expect to pass any string as hash_key
   - The parameter name and type hint suggest flexibility
   - The default value being 16 bytes is not explained as a requirement
   - The inconsistent behavior across dtypes is confusing and undocumented

CONCLUSION: The documentation is incomplete and misleading. It fails to document a critical requirement that the hash_key must be exactly 16 bytes when encoded, especially for object dtype data. This is a clear documentation deficiency that leads to runtime errors.
