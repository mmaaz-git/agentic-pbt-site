BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. Test Environment:
   - pandas version: Current (from miniconda installation)
   - Python version: 3.13
   - Test data: Array with 19 zeros and one value of 5e-324 (smallest positive denormalized float)

2. Reproduction of the Bug Report:
   ✓ Successfully reproduced the exact error described in the bug report

   Without duplicates='drop':
   - Error: "Bin edges must be unique: Index([0.0, 0.0, 5e-324], dtype='float64')"
   - Message suggests: "You can drop duplicate edges by setting the 'duplicates' kwarg"

   With duplicates='drop':
   - Error: "missing values must be missing in the same location both left and right sides"
   - This is the confusing error mentioned in the bug report

3. Root Cause Investigation:
   ✓ Confirmed the root cause analysis in the bug report:

   - _round_frac(5e-324, 3) returns NaN
   - The function calculates digits = 323 for 5e-324 (due to log10 calculation)
   - np.around(5e-324, 323) returns NaN (confirmed with direct testing)
   - np.around starts returning NaN when digits >= 323 for this value

4. Technical Details Verified:
   - The _round_frac function in tile.py line 615 does indeed calculate extremely large digit values for tiny floats
   - When whole == 0, it calculates: digits = -int(np.floor(np.log10(abs(frac)))) - 1 + precision
   - For 5e-324: log10(5e-324) ≈ -323.3, so digits becomes 323
   - NumPy's around() function returns NaN when given such large digits values
   - This causes one bin edge to become NaN while another remains 0.0
   - IntervalIndex.from_breaks() then fails with the "missing values" error

5. Hypothesis Test Results:
   ✓ The hypothesis test failed as expected with the given input
   ✓ Multiple other similar failures were found during hypothesis testing
   ✓ The failures are consistent with the NaN issue in _round_frac

6. Catch-22 Situation Confirmed:
   The bug report correctly identifies a catch-22:
   - Without duplicates='drop': Error tells user to use duplicates='drop'
   - With duplicates='drop': Different error that doesn't explain the real issue
   - User has no clear path to resolve the problem

The bug report's technical analysis is accurate and the issue is reproducible.
