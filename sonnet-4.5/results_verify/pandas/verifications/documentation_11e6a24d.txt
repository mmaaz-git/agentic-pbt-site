DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR pandas.api.extensions.take
======================================================

Based on the official pandas documentation retrieved via help(pandas.api.extensions.take), the function has the following documented behavior:

EXCEPTIONS DOCUMENTED:
----------------------
The documentation explicitly states two exceptions that can be raised:

1. **IndexError**: "When `indices` is out of bounds for the array."
2. **ValueError**: "When the indexer contains negative values other than ``-1`` and `allow_fill` is True."

There is NO mention of OverflowError in the documentation.

KEY POINTS FROM DOCUMENTATION:
------------------------------
1. The function accepts indices as "sequence of int or one-dimensional np.ndarray of int"
2. With allow_fill=False (the default), negative values indicate positional indices from the right (similar to numpy.take)
3. The documentation explicitly promises IndexError when indices are out of bounds

DOCUMENTATION CLARITY:
---------------------
The documentation is clear and unambiguous about what exception should be raised for out-of-bounds indices. It states definitively: "Raises IndexError When `indices` is out of bounds for the array."

This is not a case where the documentation is vague or leaves room for interpretation. The contract is explicit - ANY out of bounds index should raise IndexError, regardless of the reason it's out of bounds (whether it's simply beyond array size or beyond representable integer range).

COMPARISON WITH NUMPY:
---------------------
The documentation mentions that the behavior is "similar to numpy.take" for negative indices when allow_fill=False. This suggests the function should maintain consistency with numpy's error handling patterns.

CONCLUSION:
----------
The documentation provides a clear contract that IndexError should be raised for out-of-bounds indices, with no exceptions or caveats mentioned for integer overflow scenarios. The current behavior of raising OverflowError for indices that overflow C long representation violates this documented contract.
