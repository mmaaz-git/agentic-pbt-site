## Documentation Analysis

### FrozenList Class Documentation
FrozenList is an internal pandas class defined in `pandas/core/indexes/frozen.py`. It is described as:
- "Container that doesn't allow setting item *but* because it's technically hashable, will be used for lookups, appropriately, etc."
- It inherits from both PandasObject and list
- Used internally for MultiIndex names and levels

### Union Method Documentation
The union method's docstring states two contradictory things:
1. Line 36 (summary): "Returns a FrozenList with other concatenated to the end of self."
2. Line 46 (Returns section): "The collection difference between self and other."

### What "Union" Should Mean
In standard set theory and programming contexts:
- **Union**: Combines all elements from both sets/collections (A âˆª B contains all elements in A or B)
- **Difference**: Elements in the first set but not in the second (A - B contains elements in A but not in B)

### Implementation Analysis
The actual implementation at line 50:
```python
return type(self)(super().__add__(other))
```
This uses list's `__add__` method, which concatenates lists. This is consistent with a union operation for lists (though not a set union which would remove duplicates).

### Comparison with Similar Methods
1. The `difference` method (lines 52-68) correctly implements set difference and has consistent documentation
2. Line 74 shows that `__add__` and `__iadd__` are aliased to `union`, confirming concatenation is the intended behavior

### Public vs Internal API
- FrozenList appears to be primarily an internal API used by pandas
- It's imported within pandas modules but not exposed in the main public API documentation
- The class is used for MultiIndex internals (names, levels, codes)

### Conclusion
The documentation error is clear: The Returns section of the union method's docstring incorrectly describes the return value. The method name "union" and its implementation (concatenation) are consistent with each other, but the Returns section appears to be copied from the difference method's docstring.
