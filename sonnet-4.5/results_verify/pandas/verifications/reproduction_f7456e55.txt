## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Verification
I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The key findings are:

1. **Source Code Inspection**:
   - Confirmed that `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/_util.py` contains the duplicate dictionary key
   - Line 41: `pa.string(): pd.StringDtype(),`
   - Line 44: `pa.string(): pd.StringDtype(),`
   - Both lines are identical, mapping the same key to the same value

2. **Hypothesis Test Results**:
   - The test passes (returns 1 occurrence of pa.string() in the final dictionary)
   - This confirms Python's standard behavior: duplicate keys in dictionary literals result in later values overwriting earlier ones
   - The test correctly identifies that only one entry exists in the runtime dictionary

3. **Reproduction Code Results**:
   - Successfully ran the reproduction code
   - Confirmed that the resulting dictionary has only 1 entry for pa.string()
   - Both duplicate entries map to pd.StringDtype(), so the functional behavior is unchanged
   - Line 44 is indeed dead code that never takes effect

4. **Python Behavior Verification**:
   - Created additional test to demonstrate Python's behavior with duplicate dictionary keys
   - Confirmed that in Python, when a dictionary literal has duplicate keys, only the last value is retained
   - This is silent behavior - no warning or error is raised

### Effect of the Bug
The bug has minimal functional impact because:
- Both duplicate entries map to the same value (pd.StringDtype())
- The resulting dictionary behaves correctly at runtime
- However, it represents dead code and likely a copy-paste error
- This violates code quality principles and could confuse developers

### Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. There is indeed a duplicate dictionary key in the `_arrow_dtype_mapping()` function, and line 44 is dead code that should be removed for code cleanliness and maintainability.
