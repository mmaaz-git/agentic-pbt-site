# Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is confirmed to exist.

## Test Results

### 1. Minimal Example Test
The minimal reproduction case from the bug report works exactly as described:
- Input: `slice(1, 0, 1)` on target `[0]`
- Expected (actual Python slice): length 0 (empty list)
- Calculated by length_of_indexer: -1
- This confirms the bug: the function returns -1 instead of 0

### 2. Additional Test Cases
All additional failing examples mentioned in the report were confirmed:
- `slice(2, 1, 1)` returns -1 instead of 0
- `slice(4, 2, 1)` returns -2 instead of 0
- `slice(None, None, -1)` on target of length 5 returns -5 instead of 5
- `slice(2, 4, -1)` returns -2 instead of 0

### 3. Root Cause Verification
The bug occurs in the formula at line 316 of utils.py:
```python
return (stop - start + step - 1) // step
```

When `start > stop` with `step > 0`, or after normalization for negative steps, this formula can produce negative results. For example:
- slice(1, 0, 1): (0 - 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 = -1 // 1 = -1
- slice(4, 2, 1): (2 - 4 + 1 - 1) // 1 = -2 // 1 = -2

### 4. Impact
The function `length_of_indexer` is used internally by pandas in check_setitem_lengths (line 175) to validate array lengths during assignment operations. Returning negative lengths violates the fundamental invariant that lengths must be non-negative and can cause incorrect validation or downstream errors.

The bug report is accurate and the reproduction steps work exactly as described.
