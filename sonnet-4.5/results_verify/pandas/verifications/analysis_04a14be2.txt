## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is private (underscore-prefixed) and is never called anywhere in the codebase. There's no documentation promising this function exists or works in any particular way. Private functions can be broken, incomplete, or experimental without constituting a bug. The pandas API makes no guarantees about private functions.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function does exist in the codebase and if someone were to call it (despite it being private), it would fail with an OverflowError. The error is real and reproducible.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is dead code that has zero impact on any actual pandas functionality. No user can encounter this bug through normal pandas usage since the function is never called. The function appears to be leftover code from an earlier implementation that was replaced by _convert_datetimes. Fixing dead code that will never execute is not a priority. The effort to fix it provides no value to users.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Dead code should generally be removed rather than left to rot in the codebase. If the maintainers care about code cleanliness, they might want to address this by removing the function entirely.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There is no documentation issue here. The function is undocumented (as private functions often are) and the lack of documentation is appropriate for dead code. The public API documentation correctly documents only the public read_sas function.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is clearly a code issue (dead code with a latent bug), not a documentation issue. The documentation correctly omits this private function.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that if users want a scalar datetime parsing function for SAS dates, this could be turned into a feature request to properly implement and expose such functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report is not asking for new functionality. It's reporting dead code with a bug. The functionality already exists in the vectorized _convert_datetimes function which works correctly.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code does contain a genuine overflow bug that would manifest if the function were ever called. Dead code in a codebase is itself a form of bug (code smell). The function fails to handle valid inputs that the replacement function handles correctly.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function is never called, so the bug can never manifest in practice. It's a private function with no documentation or API guarantees. The issue has zero impact on any pandas user. This is more of a code quality issue than a functional bug.

## Overall consideration
This bug report identifies real issues: the function is indeed dead code and does contain an OverflowError bug. However, the critical factor is that this is a private, undocumented function that is never called anywhere in the pandas codebase. No user can encounter this bug through any normal or even abnormal use of pandas. The function appears to be leftover code from an earlier implementation that was replaced by the superior _convert_datetimes function.

While technically accurate, this is the type of issue that most maintainers would close as WONTFIX because it has zero practical impact. The dead code could be removed for cleanliness, but fixing a bug in dead code that will never execute is not a valuable use of development time. The report even acknowledges this is "Low" severity and suggests removing the dead code entirely, which is the appropriate resolution.

Given that this is dead code with zero user impact, and the reporter themselves suggests removal rather than fixing, this should be classified as WONTFIX. The appropriate action would be to remove the dead function in a future cleanup, but this doesn't rise to the level of a bug that needs fixing.
