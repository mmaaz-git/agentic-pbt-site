## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Summary
The bug report claims that null values in categorical columns are lost when round-tripping through the DataFrame interchange protocol. The `from_dataframe` function incorrectly maps null sentinel values to valid category values due to a modulo operation.

### Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

### Hypothesis Test
- Ran the provided property-based test with hypothesis
- Test FAILS as reported with input: cat_values=['a', 'a'], null_mask=[False, True]
- Error: DataFrame.iloc[:, 0] values differ - expected NaN but got 'a' at position 1

### Minimal Reproduction
- Created DataFrame with categorical column containing ['a', None]
- After round-trip through interchange protocol:
  - Original: ['a', NaN]
  - Result: ['a', 'a']
- Null value at position 1 was incorrectly converted to 'a'

### Code Analysis
Located the bug in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/interchange/from_dataframe.py` at line 254:
```python
values = categories[codes % len(categories)]
```

The issue is confirmed:
- Categorical data uses codes where -1 represents null values
- The modulo operation: -1 % 1 = 0, which maps the null to the first category
- This happens before set_nulls() is called on line 263, causing data corruption

### Cross-Type Comparison
Tested round-tripping with different data types:
- Numeric columns: Nulls preserved correctly
- String columns: Nulls preserved correctly
- Categorical columns: Nulls NOT preserved (bug confirmed)

### Conclusion
The bug is real and causes silent data corruption where missing values in categorical columns are replaced with valid category values during round-trip conversion through the interchange protocol.
