## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs when creating an `AbstractMethodError` with `methodtype='classmethod'` while passing an instance object instead of a class object.

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test failed exactly as described, with `methodtype='classmethod'` causing an AttributeError when an instance is passed.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: The specific example provided in the bug report:
   ```python
   instance = MyClass()
   error = pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(instance, methodtype='classmethod')
   print(str(error))
   ```
   Failed with: `AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__name__'`

3. **Additional Testing**:
   - When a CLASS is passed with `methodtype='classmethod'`: Works correctly
   - When an INSTANCE is passed with other methodtypes ('method', 'staticmethod', 'property'): Works correctly
   - Only the combination of INSTANCE + 'classmethod' fails

### Root Cause:

Looking at the source code in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/errors/__init__.py`:

```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    if self.methodtype == "classmethod":
        name = self.class_instance.__name__  # Line 305 - assumes class_instance is a class
    else:
        name = type(self.class_instance).__name__  # Gets class name from instance
    return f"This {self.methodtype} must be defined in the concrete class {name}"
```

The issue is on line 305: when `methodtype=='classmethod'`, the code assumes `class_instance` is a class object (with `__name__` attribute). However, the constructor accepts any object, and when an instance is passed, it lacks the `__name__` attribute, causing the crash.

The bug is real and reproducible. Exception objects should always be convertible to strings without crashing.
