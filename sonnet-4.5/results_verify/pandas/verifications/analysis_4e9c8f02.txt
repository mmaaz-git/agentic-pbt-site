## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation explicitly states "file format is inferred from file extension"
- The term "file extension" has a universally understood meaning in computing (the suffix after the last dot)
- The current implementation uses substring matching which is fundamentally different from extension checking
- This causes real-world problems: backup files, temporary files, and archived files are misidentified
- The bug is easily reproducible and the fix is straightforward
- The behavior violates user expectations based on the documentation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None identified

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug is clearly valid and reproducible

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation is clear about extension-based detection
- The test cases are valid and demonstrate the issue
- The current behavior contradicts documented behavior

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that files named like "data.xpt.backup" are uncommon

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Backup files with double extensions are common in many workflows
- The fix is trivial (change `in` to `endswith()`)
- The bug causes confusion and unexpected errors
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects any file with these substrings

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could change documentation to say "inferred from presence of '.xpt' or '.sas7bdat' in filename"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This would be counterintuitive and non-standard behavior
- Every other file format detection system uses actual extensions
- The intent is clearly extension-based detection
- Changing documentation to match buggy behavior is backwards

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - this is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The functionality already exists and is documented
- This is a bug in implementation, not a missing feature

### Analysis Summary

This is a clear case of a **BUG**. The implementation does not match the documented behavior. The documentation promises extension-based format detection, but the code performs substring-based detection. This causes legitimate files with compound extensions (like backup files) to be misidentified.

The fix is simple and correct: replace substring checking with proper extension checking using `endswith()`. This aligns the implementation with both the documentation and standard file handling practices across the industry.
