## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The zsqrt function is an internal, undocumented function in pandas.core.window.common. It's not part of the public API, has no docstring, and is not listed in pandas' official documentation. Users should not be directly importing and using internal functions from pandas.core modules. The function was never designed or documented to handle scalar inputs - all internal usage passes Series/DataFrame/array objects. Since there's no documentation claiming it should work with scalars, and it's an internal function, the bug report complains about undefined behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
Even though it's internal, the function is importable without underscore prefixes, and the crash is a real technical issue. The function name "zsqrt" (zero-safe square root) suggests a general mathematical operation that could logically work on scalars. The implementation already handles multiple input types (DataFrame vs other), so scalar support could be seen as a natural extension.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal utility function that no end user should be calling directly. All legitimate uses within pandas pass appropriate array-like objects. Adding scalar support would add complexity for a use case that should never occur in practice. The function works perfectly for its intended internal purpose. Fixing this would be addressing a misuse of an internal API, which is typically not a maintainer priority.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is relatively simple (checking np.ndim or using hasattr), and having internal functions that crash on unexpected inputs could be seen as poor defensive programming. If someone is debugging pandas internals, having robust internal functions could be helpful.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function lacks any documentation about expected input types. Adding a docstring clarifying that it expects Series/DataFrame/array inputs would prevent misuse. This would document the existing, working behavior rather than changing code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Internal functions typically don't need extensive documentation since they're not meant for external use. The lack of documentation for an internal function is normal, not a documentation bug. The real issue is that someone is trying to use an internal function, not that the internal function lacks docs.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting scalar inputs would be a new feature, not a bug fix, since the function never claimed to support them. The user is essentially requesting that an internal function be enhanced to handle a broader range of inputs. This would extend functionality beyond the original design scope.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Feature requests should be for user-facing functionality. Requesting features for internal, undocumented functions doesn't make sense - if scalar sqrt is needed, users should use numpy.sqrt or math.sqrt, not internal pandas functions.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with a clear error when given scalar inputs, which could be seen as poor error handling. The concept of "zero-safe square root" is mathematically valid for scalars. The function already tries to handle multiple types (DataFrame vs other), suggesting type flexibility was intended.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an internal function with no documentation or API promises. It works correctly for all intended use cases within pandas. Users accessing internal functions and passing unexpected inputs is not a bug - it's misuse of an internal API. The function was never designed, documented, or intended to handle scalars.

## Overall consideration

This bug report concerns an internal, undocumented function in pandas.core.window.common that was never intended for direct external use. The function has no docstring, is not part of the public API, and all legitimate internal uses pass Series, DataFrame, or array objects - never scalars. The reporter is essentially complaining that an internal utility function doesn't handle input types it was never designed to handle.

The key factor here is that pandas.core modules contain internal implementation details, not public APIs. The function works perfectly for its intended purpose within pandas' rolling and exponentially-weighted window operations. While the technical description of the crash is accurate, this represents a misuse of pandas internals rather than a legitimate bug. Users who need zero-safe square root for scalars should use appropriate mathematical libraries, not internal pandas utilities.

Given that roughly 90% of bug reports from this user are incorrect, and this report involves using an undocumented internal function in an unintended way, this should be closed as INVALID. The function behaves correctly for all documented and intended use cases. Adding scalar support to an internal function that should never be called directly would be addressing a non-existent use case and could even encourage further misuse of internal APIs.
