## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Verification
The bug report is accurate and reproducible. Both test cases provided demonstrate the mutation issue clearly.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test correctly identifies the mutation issue. When testing with the specific input `['self', 'arg1', 'arg2']`:
- Original list: `['self', 'arg1', 'arg2']`
- After calling `_format_argument_list`: `['arg1', 'arg2']`
- The 'self' element was removed from the original list (mutation occurred)

### Decorator Example Results
The decorator example clearly shows the mutation happens at runtime:
1. Before decoration: `['self', 'x', 'y']`
2. After decoration: `['self', 'x', 'y']` (no mutation yet)
3. After first function call: `['x', 'y']` (mutation occurred during call)
4. After second call: `['x', 'y']` (list remains mutated)

### Key Findings
1. The mutation is real and reproducible
2. The mutation occurs when `_format_argument_list` is called, which happens during the execution of the decorated function, not during decoration
3. The original list passed to the decorator is permanently modified
4. The function `_format_argument_list` directly calls `allow_args.remove("self")` on the input list without making a copy first

### Impact
This is a legitimate bug because:
- Functions should not mutate their input arguments unless explicitly documented
- The mutation is unexpected and happens at runtime, not decoration time
- If users reuse the same list for multiple decorators or store it for reference, they will encounter unexpected behavior
- The mutation violates the principle of least surprise in Python programming
