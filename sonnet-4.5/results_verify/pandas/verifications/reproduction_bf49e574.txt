BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

1. REPRODUCTION OF THE BUG
--------------------------
I successfully reproduced the bug using the provided test code. When creating an AbstractMethodError with methodtype="classmethod" and passing an instance (rather than a class) as the class_instance parameter, the code crashes when attempting to convert the error to a string.

Test Results:
- Simple reproduction script: CONFIRMED CRASH
  Output: "CRASH: 'DummyClass' object has no attribute '__name__'"

- Hypothesis property-based test: CONFIRMED FAILURE
  Falsifying example found: valid_methodtype='classmethod'
  The test fails specifically when methodtype='classmethod' but works fine for 'method', 'staticmethod', and 'property'

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
----------------------
The crash occurs in the __str__ method (line 305 of pandas/errors/__init__.py):

```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    if self.methodtype == "classmethod":
        name = self.class_instance.__name__  # <-- CRASH HERE
    else:
        name = type(self.class_instance).__name__
    return f"This {self.methodtype} must be defined in the concrete class {name}"
```

The issue: When methodtype is "classmethod", the code assumes class_instance is a class (which has __name__ attribute). However, if an instance is passed instead, it lacks __name__ and causes AttributeError.

3. INCONSISTENCY IN THE API
---------------------------
The __init__ method accepts ANY object as class_instance without validation:

```python
def __init__(self, class_instance, methodtype: str = "method") -> None:
    types = {"method", "classmethod", "staticmethod", "property"}
    if methodtype not in types:
        raise ValueError(...)
    self.methodtype = methodtype
    self.class_instance = class_instance  # No validation here
```

This creates an inconsistency where:
- The constructor accepts instances for all methodtypes
- The __str__ method only handles instances correctly for non-classmethod types
- For classmethod, __str__ expects a class object, not an instance

4. EXPECTED VS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
------------------------------
Expected: Either the error should be created successfully and convert to string properly, OR it should fail at initialization with a clear error message.

Actual: The error is created successfully but crashes later during string conversion with an AttributeError that doesn't clearly explain the issue.
