## Documentation Analysis

### Official Pandas Documentation

From the pandas documentation at https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html:

The `step` parameter is documented as:
- "Evaluate the window at every `step` result, equivalent to slicing as `[::step]`"
- "window must be an integer" (when using step)
- "Using a step argument other than None or 1 will produce a result with a different shape than the input"
- Added in version 1.5.0

### Source Code Documentation

From the docstring in pandas/core/window/rolling.py (line 962-968):
```
step : int, default None

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Evaluate the window at every ``step`` result, equivalent to slicing as
    ``[::step]``. ``window`` must be an integer. Using a step argument other
    than None or 1 will produce a result with a different shape than the input.
```

### Critical Observation

**The documentation does NOT specify valid constraints for the step parameter**:
- It doesn't say step must be positive
- It doesn't say step must be greater than 0
- It doesn't say step cannot be 0
- It only describes what step does (evaluates at every step result)

### Semantic Understanding

The documentation mentions that step is "equivalent to slicing as `[::step]`". In Python:
- Slicing with `[::0]` raises ValueError: slice step cannot be zero
- This is a well-known Python constraint

The documentation's comparison to Python slicing implies that step=0 should not be valid, but this is never explicitly stated.

### Conclusion

The documentation is incomplete. It fails to specify that step must be greater than 0, which is a requirement both semantically (a step of 0 makes no sense for a rolling window) and practically (Python slicing doesn't allow step=0). This lack of documentation clarity contributes to the issue where invalid input passes validation.
