## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the reported bug with FixedForwardWindowIndexer accepting negative window sizes and producing invalid window bounds.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction:**
   - Created and ran the provided Hypothesis test
   - The test correctly fails with the assertion error: "Window bounds violated: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0"
   - This confirms that with num_values=2 and window_size=-1, the indexer produces invalid bounds

2. **Simple Example Reproduction:**
   - Ran the provided simple example code
   - Output matched exactly what was reported:
     ```
     start: [0 1]
     end: [0 0]
     Bug: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0
     ```

### Verified Behavior
The bug is confirmed. When FixedForwardWindowIndexer is initialized with a negative window_size (e.g., -1), the get_window_bounds() method produces invalid window bounds where:
- For index 0: start=0, end=0 (valid, empty window)
- For index 1: start=1, end=0 (INVALID - start > end)

### Impact
This violates the fundamental invariant that window bounds must satisfy start[i] <= end[i]. Any code that uses these bounds for array slicing or iteration would fail or produce incorrect results. For example:
- `array[start[1]:end[1]]` would be `array[1:0]`, which is an empty slice when it shouldn't be
- Iteration from start[1] to end[1] would fail or require special handling

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
