## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. Here are the key findings:

### Test Results

1. **Normal values work correctly**: Small datetime values (e.g., 100 seconds) convert properly to pandas datetime64 format.

2. **NaN values are handled correctly**: The function properly converts NaN to NaT (Not-a-Time).

3. **Large values cause exceptions**:
   - Values like 1e16 seconds raise `OutOfBoundsDatetime` exception with message "cannot convert input 1e+16 with the unit 's'"
   - Even larger values like 9.223372036854776e+18 raise `OverflowError` with message "Python int too large to convert to C long"

4. **The hypothesis test fails consistently**: Running the property-based test with values between 1e16 and 1e18 consistently triggers OutOfBoundsDatetime or OverflowError exceptions.

### Technical Details

The function uses two different code paths:
- For unit='s': Uses `cast_from_unit_vectorized` to convert seconds to milliseconds, then creates datetime64[ms]
- For unit='d': Converts directly to numpy datetime64[D] then to datetime64[s]

Both paths can fail with overflow errors when given very large values. The datetime64 type has limits:
- For millisecond resolution: approximately year -292,275,055 to year 292,278,994
- Values like 1e16 seconds (approximately 317 million years) exceed these limits

### Verification

The bug report accurately describes the behavior:
1. The function does crash with OutOfBoundsDatetime or OverflowError on large values
2. The provided test cases reproduce the exact errors mentioned
3. The function handles NaN correctly but not out-of-range numeric values
4. The inconsistency exists: NaN → NaT (handled), large values → Exception (crash)

The technical description and reproduction code in the bug report are correct.
