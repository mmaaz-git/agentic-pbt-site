## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments For:**
- The behavior causes real data integrity issues - column lookups fail after round-trip
- Silent type conversion without warning is dangerous
- JSON object keys are always strings, so converting them to integers is arguably incorrect
- The behavior is counterintuitive - users expect round-trip to preserve structure
- Causes KeyError when accessing columns by original string name
- Multiple GitHub issues show this is a recurring user pain point
- The conversion is overly aggressive - it assumes numeric-looking strings should be integers

**Arguments Against:**
- The `convert_axes=True` parameter is documented to "convert axes to proper dtypes"
- There's a workaround available (`convert_axes=False`)
- No explicit round-trip guarantee in documentation

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The behavior follows the documented `convert_axes` parameter
- Documentation says it will "convert to proper dtypes"
- No explicit promise of perfect round-trip preservation
- The parameter default of True implies conversion is expected

**Arguments Against:**
- Just because it's documented doesn't mean the behavior is correct
- "Proper dtypes" is vague and doesn't warn about breaking changes
- Users have a reasonable expectation that column names remain unchanged
- The fact that JSON keys are strings makes integer conversion questionable

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could be considered an edge case with numeric-looking string columns
- Workaround exists with `convert_axes=False`
- Changing default behavior might break existing code

**Arguments Against:**
- Not an edge case - numeric string columns are common (years, IDs, etc.)
- Silent data corruption is never acceptable as "wontfix"
- The issue affects data integrity, not just convenience

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The code technically works as designed with `convert_axes=True`
- Main issue is that documentation doesn't clearly warn about this behavior
- Documentation should explicitly state that numeric-looking strings become integers
- Should provide examples showing when to use `convert_axes=False`

**Arguments Against:**
- The behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation
- Even with better docs, the default behavior is still surprising and dangerous

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could request a smarter conversion that preserves original JSON key types
- Request for true round-trip guarantee as a new feature
- Request for a warning when types are converted

**Arguments Against:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding a new feature
- Round-trip preservation is a reasonable default expectation

### Conclusion

This appears to be a combination of a **BUG** and a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**.

The strongest argument is that this is a **BUG** because:
1. JSON object keys are always strings by specification
2. Converting string keys to integers breaks the fundamental JSON structure
3. It causes silent data corruption and column access failures
4. The behavior violates reasonable user expectations
5. It's not an obscure edge case - numeric string identifiers are common

While the `convert_axes` parameter is documented, the documentation is vague about what "proper dtypes" means, and the current behavior of converting JSON string keys to integers is arguably incorrect since JSON keys must be strings.

The aggressive type conversion that changes '0' to 0 is a bug because it fundamentally alters the data structure in a way that breaks code and violates the JSON specification's constraint that object keys are strings.
