## Documentation Analysis for pandas.util.version.LegacyVersion.public

### Source Code Analysis
The pandas.util.version module is vendored from the packaging library (pypa/packaging). The code includes two main version classes:
1. `Version` - For PEP 440 compliant version strings
2. `LegacyVersion` - For non-PEP 440 version strings (deprecated)

### Current Implementation
Looking at the source code:

**Version.public** (line 429-430):
```python
@property
def public(self) -> str:
    return str(self).split("+", 1)[0]
```
This implementation removes the local version identifier by splitting on '+' and taking the first part.

**LegacyVersion.public** (line 204-205):
```python
@property
def public(self) -> str:
    return self._version
```
This implementation simply returns the full version string without modification.

### PEP 440 Definition
According to PEP 440:
- A public version identifier follows the format: `[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]`
- A local version identifier extends this with: `<public version identifier>+<local version label>`
- The public version excludes everything after the '+' character

### Documentation from packaging library
The packaging library documentation confirms that the `public` property should return the public portion of the version, excluding local version identifiers (anything after '+').

### Key Finding
There is NO explicit documentation stating that LegacyVersion.public should behave differently from Version.public. Both inherit from _BaseVersion and share the same API. The documentation for the packaging library indicates that the public property should exclude local identifiers.

### Deprecation Status
LegacyVersion is deprecated (warning on line 191-195), but it still exists and is used when parse() encounters non-PEP 440 versions. The deprecation doesn't mean its behavior should be inconsistent with the documented API.
