DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I reviewed the official pandas documentation and source code for hash_array. Here are my findings:

1. Official API Documentation (pandas.pydata.org):
   - The hash_key parameter is documented as: "Hash_key for string key to encode"
   - Default value shown: '0123456789123456' (16 characters)
   - NO explicit mention of a 16-byte requirement in the public documentation
   - No warning about what happens with non-16-byte keys

2. Source Code Comments:
   - In the source code (hashing.py), there is a comment: "# 16 byte long hashing key"
   - This comment is above the _default_hash_key definition
   - However, this is an internal code comment, not part of the public API documentation

3. Function Docstring:
   - The docstring in the function itself only says: "hash_key : str, default _default_hash_key / Hash_key for string key to encode."
   - No mention of the 16-byte requirement
   - No mention that the parameter is ignored for numeric arrays

4. Documentation Gaps:
   - The public documentation does not specify that hash_key must be exactly 16 bytes
   - The documentation does not mention that hash_key is ignored for numeric dtypes
   - The documentation does not warn about the ValueError that occurs with invalid lengths
   - Users must infer the requirement from the default value or encounter the error

5. Implicit vs Explicit Requirements:
   - While the default is 16 characters, this could be seen as an implementation detail
   - The documentation never explicitly states this as a requirement
   - The error message comes from internal Cython code, not documented behavior

The documentation is incomplete regarding the hash_key parameter's constraints and behavior.
