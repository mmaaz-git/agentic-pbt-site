## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Execution Results

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. The test cases confirm the behavior described in the bug report.

### Specific Case (num_values=2, window_size=-1):
- **Input**: FixedForwardWindowIndexer(window_size=-1), num_values=2
- **Output**: start=[0, 1], end=[0, 0]
- **Violation**: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0, violating the invariant start[i] <= end[i]

### Pattern of Violations:
Testing various negative window sizes revealed a consistent pattern:
- With window_size=-1: Violations occur for all num_values > 1
- With window_size=-2: Similar violations with different end values
- With window_size=-5, -10: More severe violations with multiple indices having start > end

### How the Code Produces This:
1. The code calculates: `start = np.arange(0, num_values, step)`
2. Then: `end = start + self.window_size` (adding negative value)
3. Finally: `end = np.clip(end, 0, num_values)` (clipping negative values to 0)

For example with window_size=-1 and num_values=2:
- start = [0, 1]
- end (before clip) = [0, 1] + (-1) = [-1, 0]
- end (after clip) = [0, 0] (the -1 gets clipped to 0)
- Result: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0

### Actual Effect on Operations:
When using these invalid bounds with DataFrame.rolling():
- All windows produce empty slices (e.g., array[1:0] = empty array)
- The rolling sum returns all NaN values
- This is technically "working" (no crash) but produces semantically meaningless results

### Technical Correctness of Bug Report:
The bug report is technically correct:
1. The invariant violation (start[i] > end[i]) does occur as claimed
2. The reproduction code works exactly as shown
3. The root cause analysis about clipping is accurate
4. The effect creates empty/invalid window slices

### Comparison with Expected Behavior:
The bug report suggests this violates user expectations because:
- Window bounds should represent valid slice boundaries
- start[i] > end[i] produces empty slices in an unintuitive way
- A "forward-looking" window with negative size doesn't make semantic sense
