## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Test Results

1. **Primary Bug Reproduction**: When calling `FixedForwardWindowIndexer.get_window_bounds()` with `step=0`, the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` with the message "division by zero" instead of a more descriptive `ValueError`.

2. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - `window_size=1, num_values=1, step=0`: Raises `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero` ✓
   - `window_size=5, num_values=10, step=0`: Raises `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero` ✓
   - All tested combinations consistently raise `ZeroDivisionError` when step=0

3. **Normal Operation**: The function works correctly with valid step values:
   - `step=1`: Works as expected
   - `step=-1`: Returns empty arrays (which may be intended behavior for negative steps)

### Effect of the Bug

The bug has the following effects:

1. **Poor User Experience**: Users get a cryptic `ZeroDivisionError` that doesn't immediately indicate what parameter caused the issue. The error message "division by zero" doesn't help users understand that the problem is with the `step` parameter.

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: The function already validates other invalid parameters:
   - `center=True` raises `ValueError: "Forward-looking windows can't have center=True"`
   - `closed` not None raises `ValueError: "Forward-looking windows don't support setting the closed argument"`

   But `step=0` doesn't follow this pattern of clear, descriptive error messages.

3. **Implementation Detail Leak**: The ZeroDivisionError comes from numpy's `arange` function, which is an internal implementation detail that shouldn't be exposed to users.

### Conclusion

The bug report is accurate. The function does raise an unclear `ZeroDivisionError` when `step=0` instead of a descriptive `ValueError` that would be consistent with the function's other parameter validation.
