## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

Successfully reproduced the bug with the exact same errors as reported:

1. **Large seconds test (100000000000000.0)**:
   - Error: `OverflowError: days=1157407407; must have magnitude <= 999999999`
   - Occurs at line 72 in sas7bdat.py when attempting `timedelta(seconds=sas_datetime)`
   - The value equals 1,157,407,407 days which exceeds timedelta's max of 999,999,999 days

2. **Large days test (2936550.0)**:
   - Error: `OverflowError: date value out of range`
   - Occurs at line 75 when attempting `datetime(1960, 1, 1) + timedelta(days=sas_datetime)`
   - This value would result in date 9999-12-31 + 1 day, exceeding datetime.max

### Technical Verification

1. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - 2936549 days from 1960-01-01 = 9999-12-31 (valid, just at the edge)
   - 2936550 days from 1960-01-01 = 10000-01-01 (invalid, exceeds datetime.max)
   - The bug report's test value is precisely 1 day beyond the valid range

2. **NaN Handling Verification**:
   - Confirmed that NaN inputs correctly return pd.NaT
   - This demonstrates the function has some error handling capability

3. **Hypothesis Tests**:
   - Both property-based tests fail as expected
   - The tests are correctly written and expose the crash condition

### Accuracy of Bug Report

The bug report is technically accurate:
- The code examples run and produce the stated errors
- The error messages match exactly
- The analysis that values exceed Python's datetime/timedelta limits is correct
- The assertion that the function crashes rather than handling the error gracefully is true

### Comparison with Related Code

The `_convert_datetimes` function in the same file uses a different approach with vectorized operations and cast_from_unit_vectorized, which may handle overflow differently. This suggests there isn't a consistent approach to datetime overflow handling in the module.
