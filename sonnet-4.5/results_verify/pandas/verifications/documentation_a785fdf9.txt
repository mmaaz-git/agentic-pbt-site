# Documentation Analysis for ExcelWriter.check_extension

## Method Documentation
According to the source code docstring, the `check_extension` method:
- "checks that path's extension against the Writer's supported extensions. If it isn't supported, raises UnsupportedFiletypeError."
- Note: The docstring says it raises UnsupportedFiletypeError but the actual code raises ValueError

## Implementation Details from Source Code
The actual implementation (from pandas.io.excel._base.ExcelWriter.check_extension):
```python
@classmethod
def check_extension(cls, ext: str) -> Literal[True]:
    """
    checks that path's extension against the Writer's supported extensions.
    If it isn't supported, raises UnsupportedFiletypeError.
    """
    if ext.startswith("."):
        ext = ext[1:]
    if not any(ext in extension for extension in cls._supported_extensions):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid extension for engine '{cls.engine}': '{ext}'")
    return True
```

## Supported Extensions
For OpenpyxlWriter, the supported extensions are: ('.xlsx', '.xlsm')

## Key Observation
The method uses substring matching (`ext in extension`) rather than exact matching. The documentation doesn't explicitly state whether:
1. The method should perform exact matching or substring matching
2. Whether extensions like '.l', '.x', '.s' should be considered valid

## Documentation Interpretation
The docstring states the method "checks that path's extension against the Writer's supported extensions." This strongly implies that the method should validate whether a given extension is one of the supported extensions (exact match), not whether it's a substring of a supported extension.

The phrase "supported extensions" refers to a specific set of file extensions that the writer can handle. In typical file system and programming contexts, file extensions are discrete units - '.xlsx' is a different extension from '.x' or '.l'.

## Conclusion
The documentation, while brief, clearly indicates the method should validate extensions against the supported set. The current implementation using substring matching appears to violate this intent, as it accepts extensions that are not actually in the supported set but merely happen to be substrings of supported extensions.
