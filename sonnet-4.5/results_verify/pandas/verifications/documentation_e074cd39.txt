## Documentation Analysis

I have reviewed the documentation for `pandas.api.extensions.take` from multiple sources:

### Official Documentation (from help() and docstring)

The `pandas.api.extensions.take` function documentation explicitly states:

> **fill_value** : any, optional
>     Fill value to use for NA-indices when `allow_fill` is True.
>     This may be ``None``, in which case the default NA value for
>     the type (``self.dtype.na_value``) is used.
>
>     For multi-dimensional `arr`, each *element* is filled with
>     `fill_value`.

The documentation provides clear examples showing that when a specific fill_value is provided, it should be used:

```python
>>> pd.api.extensions.take(np.array([10, 20, 30]), [0, 0, -1], allow_fill=True,
...      fill_value=-10)
array([ 10,  10, -10])
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Explicit Contract**: The documentation explicitly states that when `allow_fill=True` and a `fill_value` is provided, that value should be used for NA-indices (indicated by -1 in the indices array).

2. **Default Behavior**: The documentation clearly states that `fill_value=None` means the default NA value for the type should be used. This implies that when fill_value is not None, the provided value should be used.

3. **Consistency Expectation**: The examples show the same behavior for numpy arrays, which creates a reasonable expectation that Index objects would behave similarly.

4. **No Exceptions Documented**: There is no documentation indicating that Index objects would behave differently from arrays regarding fill_value handling.

### Source Code Comment

The source code contains an explicit comment at line 1169-1170:
```python
# Note: we discard fill_value and use self._na_value, only relevant
#  in the case where allow_fill is True and fill_value is not None
```

This comment confirms that the current implementation intentionally discards the user-provided fill_value, which directly contradicts the documented behavior.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly promises that the provided fill_value will be used when allow_fill=True and fill_value is not None. The current implementation violates this documented contract by ignoring the user-provided fill_value and always using self._na_value instead.
