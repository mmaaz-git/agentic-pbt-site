Documentation Analysis
======================

Documentation Sources Reviewed:
-------------------------------

1. Function Docstring (Primary Source):
   Located in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/compat/__init__.py

   The docstring states:
   - Summary: "Checking if the running platform use Power architecture." (CORRECT)
   - Returns: "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture." (INCORRECT)

2. Python help() Output:
   Running help(is_platform_power) shows the same docstring with the same inconsistency.

3. Implementation Code:
   The actual implementation is:
   ```python
   return platform.machine() in ("ppc64", "ppc64le")
   ```
   This clearly checks for Power architecture (ppc64 and ppc64le are Power PC architectures).

4. Context from Adjacent Code:
   The is_platform_arm() function immediately above has nearly identical docstring structure:
   - Summary: "Checking if the running platform use ARM architecture."
   - Returns: "True if the running platform uses ARM architecture."

   This strongly suggests a copy-paste error when creating is_platform_power().

Documentation Consistency Analysis:
-----------------------------------

The documentation is internally inconsistent:
- The summary line correctly identifies the function as checking for "Power architecture"
- The Returns section incorrectly states it checks for "ARM architecture"
- The implementation clearly checks for Power architectures (ppc64/ppc64le)

Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:
------------------------------------------

A reasonable developer reading the documentation would be confused:
1. The function name suggests it checks for Power architecture
2. The summary confirms it checks for Power architecture
3. The Returns section contradicts this by saying ARM architecture
4. The implementation confirms Power architecture checking

This is clearly a documentation error, not a code error. The code behaves correctly according to its name and summary description. Only the Returns section of the docstring is incorrect.

Platform Architecture Background:
---------------------------------
- ARM: Advanced RISC Machines architecture (arm64, aarch64, armv*)
- Power: IBM Power architecture (ppc64, ppc64le)
These are completely different processor architectures, so the confusion is significant.
