## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the hypothesis test and manual reproduction code confirm the issue.

### Hypothesis Test Results:
- The property-based test failed on the exact input specified in the bug report: `num_values=2, window_size=-1, step=1`
- The assertion `start[i] <= end[i]` failed at index 1 where `start=1` and `end=0`
- This confirms that negative window sizes cause invalid window bounds

### Manual Reproduction Results:
- Using `window_size=-2` and `num_values=5` produced:
  - start: [0 1 2 3 4]
  - end: [0 0 0 1 2]
  - Invalid bounds at indices 1, 2, 3, and 4 where start > end

### Specific Test Case:
- Testing the exact failing input `num_values=2, window_size=-1, step=1`:
  - start: [0 1]
  - end: [0 0]
  - Index 0 is valid (start=0, end=0)
  - Index 1 is invalid (start=1, end=0)

### Effect of the Bug:
The bug causes `FixedForwardWindowIndexer.get_window_bounds` to return window bounds that violate the fundamental invariant that `start[i] <= end[i]` for all indices. This happens because:
1. The implementation computes `end = start + window_size`
2. With negative window_size, this makes `end < start`
3. The subsequent clipping operation doesn't fix the invalid relationship

This would cause issues in any code that relies on valid window bounds, particularly when used with pandas rolling operations, where it would likely produce unexpected NaN values or errors.
