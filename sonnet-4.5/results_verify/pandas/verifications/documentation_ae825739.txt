DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. Function Docstring (from source code):
The function docstring states:
- Description: "Check if the object can be compiled into a regex pattern instance."
- Returns: "bool - Whether `obj` can be compiled as a regex pattern."
- Examples show it returning True for valid regex (".*") and False for non-string (1)

2. Official pandas documentation:
The online documentation at pandas.pydata.org confirms:
- Description: "Check if the object can be compiled into a regex pattern instance."
- Returns: "bool: Whether the object can be compiled as a regex pattern"
- The function "Determines if an object can be successfully converted into a regular expression pattern"
- "Returns False for objects that cannot be converted to a regex pattern"

3. Documentation Analysis:
The documentation is clear and unambiguous:
- The function MUST return a bool value
- It should return True if the object CAN be compiled as a regex
- It should return False if the object CANNOT be compiled as a regex
- There is NO mention of raising exceptions for invalid patterns
- The examples only show cases that currently work (valid regex and non-string)

4. Expected behavior based on documentation:
For ANY input that cannot be compiled as a regex (whether due to type issues or pattern syntax errors), the function should return False. The documentation makes no distinction between different types of compilation failures.

5. Current implementation vs documentation:
The current implementation violates the documented contract by raising re.PatternError for syntactically invalid regex patterns instead of returning False. This is a clear discrepancy between the documented behavior (always returns bool) and the actual behavior (raises exceptions for some inputs).

The documentation is correct and clear about the expected behavior. The implementation is incorrect.
