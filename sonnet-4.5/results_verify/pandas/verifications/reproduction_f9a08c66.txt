## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported against `pandas.core.dtypes.common.ensure_python_int`.

### Bug Confirmation

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction**:
   - The Hypothesis test from the bug report fails as expected
   - When run with floats that equal their integer conversion (e.g., 0.0, 42.0, 5.0), the function accepts them despite the type signature declaring `value: int | np.integer`
   - The test correctly identifies that floats are being accepted when they shouldn't be according to the type signature

2. **Manual Test Reproduction**:
   - Confirmed that `ensure_python_int(42.0)` returns `42` (as an int)
   - The input type is `<class 'float'>`
   - The function successfully converts whole-number floats to integers
   - Non-integer floats (e.g., 42.5) correctly raise a TypeError

### Source Code Analysis

From examining `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/dtypes/common.py`:

1. **Type Signature** (line 93): `def ensure_python_int(value: int | np.integer) -> int:`
   - Explicitly declares it accepts only `int` or `np.integer` types
   - Does NOT include `float` in the type union

2. **Implementation** (line 109): `if not (is_integer(value) or is_float(value)):`
   - Explicitly checks for BOTH integer AND float types
   - This directly contradicts the type signature

3. **Behavior verification**:
   - `is_integer(5.0)` returns False (floats are not considered integers)
   - `is_float(5.0)` returns True (recognizes float type)
   - The function then attempts `int(value)` conversion and checks `new_value == value`
   - For whole-number floats (42.0), this conversion succeeds

### Impact

The bug creates a clear mismatch between:
- What the type signature promises (int | np.integer only)
- What the docstring hints at ("if the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one")
- What the implementation actually does (accepts floats that can be cleanly converted)

This would cause issues for:
- Type checkers (mypy, pyright) that would reject valid runtime calls
- IDE auto-completion and type hints
- Developer expectations based on the type signature
- API consistency and documentation accuracy

The bug report is accurate and reproducible.
