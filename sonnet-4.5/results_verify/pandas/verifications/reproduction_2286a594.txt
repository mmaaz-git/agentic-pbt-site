REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable.

Test Results:
-------------
1. When calling is_re_compilable('['), the function raises a PatternError with message "unterminated character set at position 0" instead of returning False.

2. Similar PatternError exceptions are raised for other invalid regex patterns:
   - '(' raises "missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0"
   - ')' raises "unbalanced parenthesis at position 0"
   - '?' raises "nothing to repeat at position 0"
   - '*' raises "nothing to repeat at position 0"
   - '+' raises "nothing to repeat at position 0"
   - '[abc' raises "unterminated character set at position 0"
   - '(abc' raises "missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0"
   - '*abc' raises "nothing to repeat at position 0"

Expected Behavior:
-----------------
According to the bug report, the function should return False for invalid regex patterns, not raise an exception.

Actual Behavior:
---------------
The function raises re.PatternError (also known as re.error) for syntactically invalid regex patterns.

The bug report is accurate in its description - the function does indeed raise exceptions for invalid regex patterns instead of returning False as one would expect from a function named "is_re_compilable" that is documented to return a boolean.

The issue appears to be that the current implementation only catches TypeError exceptions but not re.error/re.PatternError exceptions that are raised by re.compile() when given syntactically invalid patterns.
