## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The function fails to handle valid input data (DataFrames with constant columns are valid pandas objects)
2. The function produces invalid/broken output (NaN values) that makes the visualization meaningless
3. Real-world datasets often have constant features (e.g., after filtering, certain attributes might become constant)
4. The function should either handle this gracefully or provide clear error messages
5. Silent failure with invalid output is worse than crashing - users may not realize the plot is broken
6. The normalization logic has a clear mathematical flaw (division by zero when min == max)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The specific error claimed (ZeroDivisionError) doesn't actually occur - it produces NaN instead
2. The function technically doesn't "crash" as stated in the report

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The bug report incorrectly states that a ZeroDivisionError is raised, when in fact it isn't
2. The function doesn't crash as claimed - it completes execution
3. The test code provided doesn't actually fail

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The core issue (division by zero causing invalid output) is real and correctly identified
2. The mischaracterization of the error type doesn't invalidate the underlying problem
3. Getting NaN values is arguably worse than getting an exception

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. Could be considered an obscure edge case (how often do people plot constant features?)
2. Users could preprocess their data to remove constant columns

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - constant columns frequently occur in real data
2. The function should handle all valid DataFrame inputs
3. The fix is simple and straightforward

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation doesn't specify that columns must have variance
2. The documentation could be updated to state this requirement
3. The current behavior (producing NaN) could be documented as expected

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is a functionality issue, not just a documentation issue
2. Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it acceptable
3. Users reasonably expect the function to handle all valid DataFrames

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Supporting constant columns could be seen as a new feature
2. The original RadViz algorithm may not have been designed for this case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. Handling edge cases gracefully is bug fixing, not feature addition
3. The function already attempts to normalize all columns - it just does it incorrectly

### Analysis Summary

The bug report has one factual error (claiming ZeroDivisionError when it's actually NaN), but the core issue is valid:
- Constant columns cause division by zero in normalization
- This produces NaN values that break the visualization
- The function silently produces invalid output instead of handling the case gracefully
- This is a real problem that affects valid use cases

The suggested fixes in the report are reasonable:
1. Normalize constant columns to a middle value (0.5)
2. Or provide a clear error message

This is fundamentally a bug in the normalization logic that causes the function to produce invalid output for valid input data.
