DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------
The _split_line function has the following docstring:
```python
"""
Parameters
----------
s: str
    Fixed-length string to split
parts: list of (name, length) pairs
    Used to break up string, name '_' will be filtered from output.

Returns
-------
Dict of name:contents of string at given location.
"""
```

Key observations:
- The documentation mentions that "name '_' will be filtered from output"
- However, it does NOT explicitly state that a field named '_' MUST be present
- The wording suggests '_' fields are optional ("will be filtered" implies IF present)
- There's no indication this is a required precondition

2. FUNCTION NAME AND VISIBILITY
-------------------------------
- Function name starts with underscore (_split_line), indicating it's intended as an internal/private function
- Not part of the public API (not documented in official pandas API docs)
- Only used internally within the sas_xport module
- No unit tests exist specifically for this function

3. XPORT FORMAT CONTEXT
-----------------------
- The SAS XPORT format uses fixed-width fields in header records
- Padding fields are common in the format to align data to 80-byte boundaries
- The convention of using '_' for padding appears to be an implementation choice in pandas, not a requirement of the XPORT specification itself
- The referenced XPORT specification document (https://support.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/technical-papers/record-layout-of-a-sas-version-5-or-6-data-set-in-sas-transport-xport-format.pdf) describes the format but doesn't mandate specific field naming conventions for internal parsing

4. DOCUMENTATION COMPLETENESS
-----------------------------
- The documentation is incomplete because it doesn't clarify the requirement for '_' fields
- The phrase "name '_' will be filtered from output" is ambiguous:
  * Could mean: "Any field named '_' will be removed" (optional behavior)
  * Actually means: "The field named '_' will be removed" (required field)
- The documentation doesn't indicate this is a required precondition for the function to work

5. INTERNAL VS PUBLIC FUNCTION
------------------------------
- This is clearly an internal utility function (leading underscore)
- Not exposed in the public API
- Only called from within the same module with controlled inputs
- All current callers do provide the '_' field as part of their parsing logic
