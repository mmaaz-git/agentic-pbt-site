Bug Report Triage Analysis
==========================

Analyzing the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID Analysis:
   Arguments FOR INVALID:
   - The documentation for rsplit() intentionally excludes all regex-related content
   - The template substitutions explicitly set regex_argument="" and pat_regex=""
   - The documentation never claims rsplit() should support regex patterns
   - rsplit() documentation only describes it as "String to split on", not "String or regular expression"
   - The omission appears intentional, not accidental

   Arguments AGAINST INVALID:
   - The methods are described as mirror operations that differ only in direction
   - Documentation states "Without the `n` parameter, the outputs of `rsplit` and `split` are identical"
   - Users would reasonably expect symmetric APIs for symmetric operations
   - The lack of regex support creates an inconsistency in the API

2. WONTFIX Analysis:
   Arguments FOR WONTFIX:
   - This is not a critical bug - rsplit() works correctly for literal strings
   - The current behavior has been stable since at least pandas 1.4.0
   - Users can work around this by reversing strings, using split(), then reversing results
   - The inconsistency might be considered minor since rsplit with regex is less common

   Arguments AGAINST WONTFIX:
   - This is a clear API inconsistency between two closely related methods
   - The missing parameter prevents legitimate use cases (regex patterns from the right)
   - The issue affects API symmetry and user expectations

3. FEATURE_REQUEST Analysis:
   Arguments FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - rsplit() never had regex support, so adding it would be a new feature
   - The documentation never promised regex support for rsplit()
   - The current implementation only uses Python's str.rsplit() which doesn't support regex
   - Adding regex support would require new implementation code

   Arguments AGAINST FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The bug report frames this as a missing parameter that should exist for consistency
   - split() already has the regex parameter since v1.4.0
   - This is about API completeness rather than adding entirely new functionality

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX Analysis:
   Arguments FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation could be clearer about rsplit() NOT supporting regex
   - The statement about identical outputs when n is not specified is misleading
   - Users might assume rsplit() has all the same parameters as split()

   Arguments AGAINST DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation correctly describes what rsplit() currently does
   - The parameter list in the docs accurately reflects the implementation
   - The code behavior matches what the documentation says

5. BUG Analysis:
   Arguments FOR BUG:
   - API inconsistency between two methods that should be symmetric
   - split() and rsplit() are documented as counterparts but have different capabilities
   - The missing regex parameter breaks the principle of least surprise
   - Users cannot perform regex splitting from the right, which is a reasonable expectation

   Arguments AGAINST BUG:
   - The documentation never claims rsplit() should have regex support
   - The current behavior matches the documented behavior
   - The implementation works as designed, just with fewer features

Final Assessment:
----------------
This is best categorized as a FEATURE_REQUEST. While there is an API inconsistency that could be considered a design flaw, the current implementation matches its documentation exactly. The rsplit() method never had regex support, and the documentation (through its template substitutions) intentionally excludes regex-related content. Adding regex support would be enhancing rsplit() with new functionality it never claimed to have, even if that functionality would make the API more consistent and complete.

The key factors:
1. The documentation accurately describes the current behavior
2. The code works as documented (no regex support)
3. The template substitutions show this was an intentional design choice
4. Adding regex support would require new implementation code, not fixing broken code
5. This is about adding missing functionality for API consistency, not fixing incorrect behavior
