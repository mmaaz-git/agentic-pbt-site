## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Case 1: Original Bug Report Example
Input:
- arr = np.array([''], dtype=object)
- hash_key = '000000000000000\x80' (16 characters with \x80 non-ASCII character)

Result:
- hash_key length: 16 characters (as expected)
- hash_key encoded length: 17 bytes (due to UTF-8 encoding of \x80 as \xc2\x80)
- Error: ValueError: key should be a 16-byte string encoded, got b'000000000000000\xc2\x80' (len 17)
- **Bug confirmed**: The function crashes exactly as described in the report

### Test Case 2: Valid ASCII Key
Input:
- arr = np.array([''], dtype=object)
- hash_key = '0123456789123456' (16 ASCII characters)

Result:
- hash_key length: 16 characters
- hash_key encoded length: 16 bytes
- Successfully returns: [1760245841805064774]
- Works correctly because ASCII characters are 1 byte each

### Test Case 3: Another Multi-byte Character
Input:
- arr = np.array([''], dtype=object)
- hash_key = '000000000000000ñ' (16 characters with ñ)

Result:
- hash_key length: 16 characters
- hash_key encoded length: 17 bytes (ñ encodes as \xc3\xb1 in UTF-8)
- Error: ValueError: key should be a 16-byte string encoded, got b'000000000000000\xc3\xb1' (len 17)
- Confirms the issue occurs with any multi-byte UTF-8 character

### Hypothesis Test Results
The provided hypothesis test would fail when hash_key1 contains multi-byte characters:
- The test expects different hash keys to produce different hashes
- When hash_key1='000000000000000\x80', it crashes before comparison
- When hash_key2='000000000000000x' (modified last char), it works fine
- This demonstrates the inconsistency in handling 16-character strings

### Summary
The bug is 100% reproducible. Any 16-character string containing non-ASCII characters that require more than 1 byte in UTF-8 encoding will cause hash_array() to crash with a ValueError. The error message from the C layer clearly states it expects a 16-byte encoded string, but the Python API accepts any 16-character string without validation.
