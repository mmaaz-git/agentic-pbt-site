## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The function returns -20 when it should return 0
- The docstring says "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Python's len() function never returns negative values
- The actual behavior (returning negative values) violates the documented contract
- This is a clear logic error in handling edge cases with negative indices on empty sequences

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- (No valid reasons found - this is clearly incorrect behavior)

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue the function is internal/private (pandas.core is PRIVATE)

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- Even internal functions should follow their documented behavior
- The function has a clear contract in its docstring
- Returning negative lengths violates basic programming invariants
- The bug causes real issues in pandas' internal operations

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Edge case with empty targets and large negative indices
- Internal function not meant for public use

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty sequences are common
- The bug can cause downstream errors in pandas operations
- The fix is simple and straightforward
- Violating the "lengths are non-negative" invariant is a serious issue

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could update docs to say "may return negative values for empty targets"

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current documentation is correct - it SHOULD return the expected length
- Changing docs to allow negative lengths would be wrong
- The code needs fixing, not the documentation

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue proper handling of edge cases is a new feature

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The function already exists and has a clear purpose
- Returning correct non-negative lengths is not a new feature

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function violates its documented contract by returning negative values when it should return the actual length that would result from the indexing operation. The fix is straightforward and necessary for correct operation.
