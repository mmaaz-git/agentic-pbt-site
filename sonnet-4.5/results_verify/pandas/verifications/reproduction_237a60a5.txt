REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

Bug Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

1. Minimal Reproduction Case:
   - Input data: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
   - Function call: pd.qcut(data, q=4, duplicates='drop')
   - Expected: 4 quartiles with sizes differing by at most 1
   - Actual: 3 bins with counts [3, 1, 1] (max-min difference = 2)
   - Result: Bug behavior reproduced successfully

2. Property-Based Test:
   - The Hypothesis test fails on the provided example
   - The test asserts that quartile sizes should differ by at most 1
   - Multiple failures found in random testing
   - The assertion correctly identifies uneven distributions

3. Root Cause Analysis:
   - When q=4, pandas calculates 5 quantile points: [0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%]
   - For the test data, these map to values: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
   - The 0% and 25% quantiles both have value 0.0 (duplicate bin edge)
   - With duplicates='drop', the duplicate 0.0 is removed
   - This merges the first two quartiles into a single bin
   - Result: 3 bins instead of 4, with uneven distribution

4. Behavior with duplicates='raise':
   - Correctly raises ValueError about non-unique bin edges
   - Error message suggests using duplicates='drop' to handle this

5. Verification:
   - The bug report accurately describes the behavior
   - The code output matches exactly what the bug report claims
   - The property-based test correctly identifies the issue

Conclusion: The bug is real and reproducible. The qcut function with duplicates='drop'
does produce significantly uneven bucket sizes when duplicate quantile values exist in
the data, violating the expected property of "equal-sized buckets".
