Bug Reproduction Results
========================

## Test Execution

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The hypothesis test fails as expected.

### 1. Hypothesis Test Result:
The property-based test fails with the exact input specified in the bug report:
- Failed at index 1: start=1, end=0, num_values=2, window_size=-1
- This confirms the invariant violation: start[1] > end[1]

### 2. Multiple Test Cases with Negative window_size:

num_values=2, window_size=-1:
- start: [0 1]
- end:   [0 0]
- VIOLATION at index 1: start[1]=1 > end[1]=0

num_values=5, window_size=-2:
- start: [0 1 2 3 4]
- end:   [0 0 0 1 2]
- Multiple violations where start > end

num_values=10, window_size=-5:
- start: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
- end:   [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4]
- Multiple violations throughout the arrays

### 3. Control Tests with Non-negative window_size:

num_values=3, window_size=0:
- start: [0 1 2]
- end:   [0 1 2]
- All bounds valid (empty windows)

num_values=3, window_size=1:
- start: [0 1 2]
- end:   [1 2 3]
- All bounds valid (forward-looking windows)

### 4. Technical Analysis:

The bug occurs because:
1. FixedForwardWindowIndexer calculates end = start + window_size
2. With negative window_size, this produces end < start
3. Negative end values are clipped to 0 (minimum valid index)
4. This results in situations where start[i] > end[i]

### 5. Impact Assessment:

The violation of start[i] <= end[i] invariant would cause problems in any code that:
- Iterates from start[i] to end[i]
- Calculates window size as end[i] - start[i]
- Assumes valid window bounds for slicing operations

The bug is real and reproducible. The code accepts negative window_size values without validation and produces mathematically invalid window bounds.
