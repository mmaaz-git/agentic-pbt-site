## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The reported bug has been successfully reproduced. When round-tripping an empty DataFrame through JSON with `orient='split'`, the index type is not preserved.

### Test Results

#### Property-Based Test
The hypothesis test successfully identified the issue. The test fails specifically on empty DataFrames, demonstrating that:
- Empty DataFrames with a RangeIndex lose their index type during JSON round-trip
- The original `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=0, step=1)` becomes `Index([], dtype='float64')`
- The assertion `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(df, result)` fails with:
  ```
  Attribute "inferred_type" are different
  [left]:  integer
  [right]: floating
  ```

#### Simple Reproduction
The simple reproduction code confirms the exact issue described in the bug report:
```
Original index type: <class 'pandas.core.indexes.range.RangeIndex'>
Original index: RangeIndex(start=0, stop=0, step=1)
Result index type: <class 'pandas.core.indexes.base.Index'>
Result index: Index([], dtype='float64')
Index types match: False
```

### Additional Findings
The property-based test also revealed secondary issues with float precision during JSON serialization:
- Some extreme float values (like inf) are converted to nan
- Float precision is lost for very large numbers (e.g., 5.1493867376273704e+16 becomes 5.149386738000001e+16)

### Conclusion
The bug is real and reproducible. The JSON round-trip with `orient='split'` does not preserve the index type for empty DataFrames, converting a RangeIndex to a regular Index with float64 dtype.
