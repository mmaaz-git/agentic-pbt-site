## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is CONFIRMED. Calling `ExcelWriter.close()` twice does raise a `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file` as described in the bug report.

### Test Results

1. **Main reproduction test**:
   - First close() call: Succeeded without error
   - Second close() call: Raised `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`
   - This confirms the exact behavior described in the bug report

2. **Hypothesis test**:
   - The test failed with the same error when attempting to call close() twice
   - Error: `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`

3. **Comparison with Python's built-in file objects**:
   - Standard Python file objects (using `open()`) handle multiple close() calls gracefully
   - Calling close() twice on a regular file object does NOT raise an error
   - This demonstrates that Python's file-like objects are expected to be idempotent

### Code Analysis
Looking at the pandas source code (pandas/io/excel/_base.py:1355-1358):
```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """synonym for save, to make it more file-like"""
    self._save()
    self._handles.close()
```

The implementation directly calls `self._handles.close()` without checking if the file is already closed. This causes the error on the second call.

### Impact
The bug occurs consistently and reliably. Any code that calls `close()` twice on an ExcelWriter instance will encounter this error. This can happen in:
- Defensive programming patterns where close() is called in finally blocks
- Context manager usage combined with explicit close() calls
- Error handling code that attempts to ensure resources are cleaned up

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
