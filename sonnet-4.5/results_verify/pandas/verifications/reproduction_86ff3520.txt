REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for pandas.core.util.hashing.hash_array.

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULT:
The hypothesis test failed exactly as described in the bug report. When testing arrays containing 0.0, replacing 0.0 with -0.0 produces different hash values, despite the arrays being equal according to numpy.

Test failure output:
- AssertionError: Equal arrays should have equal hashes: [0.] vs [-0.]
- Falsifying example: test_hash_equal_values_have_equal_hashes(values=[0.0])

2. MANUAL TEST RESULT:
The manual reproduction code confirms the bug:
- np.array_equal([0.0], [-0.0]) returns True (arrays are equal)
- hash_array([0.0]) returns [0]
- hash_array([-0.0]) returns [2720858781877447050]
- The hashes are NOT equal despite the arrays being equal

3. IEEE 754 AND NUMPY BEHAVIOR:
I verified that according to IEEE 754 floating-point standard:
- 0.0 == -0.0 evaluates to True
- np.equal(0.0, -0.0) returns True
- np.array_equal([0.0], [-0.0]) returns True
- Python's built-in hash(0.0) == hash(-0.0) returns True

4. ROOT CAUSE:
The implementation uses the raw bit representation of floats to compute hashes:
- Line 305-306 in hashing.py: vals.view(f"u{vals.dtype.itemsize}").astype("u8")
- This directly uses the bit pattern, which differs for 0.0 (all zeros) vs -0.0 (sign bit set)
- 0.0 bits: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
- -0.0 bits: 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

5. IMPACT:
This bug violates the fundamental hash invariant: if a == b, then hash(a) must equal hash(b).
This can cause incorrect behavior in:
- pandas groupby operations
- deduplication
- hash-based joins
- index lookups

The bug is fully confirmed and reproducible with pandas version 2.3.2.
