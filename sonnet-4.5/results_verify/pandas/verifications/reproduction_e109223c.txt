BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. TEST EXECUTION:
I successfully ran both the manual test code and the hypothesis test provided in the bug report.

2. MANUAL TEST RESULTS:
When testing with pandas 1.4.0:

With primary_key=True:
- Output: "primaryKey": true (boolean)
- Type: <class 'bool'>
- This violates Table Schema spec which requires string or array

With primary_key=False:
- Output: "primaryKey": false (boolean)
- Type: <class 'bool'>
- This also violates Table Schema spec

With primary_key=None:
- Output: "primaryKey": ["index"] (array)
- Type: <class 'list'>
- This is CORRECT per Table Schema spec

3. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
The hypothesis test FAILED as expected with the error:
"AssertionError: primaryKey should be list or None per Table Schema spec, got <class 'bool'> with value True"

The test correctly identifies that boolean values are being produced when they shouldn't be.

4. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
The bug report's technical details are 100% accurate:
- The function does produce boolean values for primaryKey when primary_key=True/False
- This does violate the Table Schema specification
- The None case works correctly, producing a list as expected
- The reproduction code is correct and demonstrates the issue clearly

5. IMPACT:
Any downstream tool expecting valid Table Schema JSON will fail to parse or process schemas generated with primary_key=True or primary_key=False. This breaks interoperability with the entire Frictionless Data ecosystem and any other tools that consume Table Schema formatted data.
