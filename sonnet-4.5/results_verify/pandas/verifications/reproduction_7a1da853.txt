Bug Reproduction Analysis
==========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. Here are the findings:

1. Reproduction Confirmed:
   - The value 1.7976931345e+308 is a valid, finite float (less than sys.float_info.max = 1.7976931348623157e+308)
   - When serialized with pandas to_json(), the value is rounded to "1.797693135e+308" (losing the last digit)
   - When deserialized with pandas read_json(), this rounded value becomes infinity
   - The assertion check confirms: original value ≠ recovered value (1.7976931345e+308 ≠ inf)

2. Root Cause Verified:
   - With default double_precision=10, the JSON contains "1.797693135e+308" which becomes inf when parsed
   - With double_precision=15, the JSON contains "1.7976931345e+308" which correctly round-trips
   - The Python literal "1.797693135e+308" is indeed parsed as infinity by Python itself

3. Comparison with Standard Library:
   - Python's standard json module correctly handles the same value without corruption
   - json.dumps/loads preserves the value as 1.7976931345e+308

4. precise_float Parameter Issue:
   - Using precise_float=True with read_json() actually causes a "Range error when decoding numeric as double"
   - This suggests the underlying ujson decoder cannot handle this value at all

5. Technical Details:
   - The bug occurs because ujson truncates to 10 digits by default
   - The truncated representation "1.797693135e+308" exceeds what Python can represent as a finite float
   - This is silent data corruption - no warning or error is raised during the round-trip

Conclusion: The bug report is technically accurate. A valid finite float value becomes infinity after round-tripping through pandas' JSON serialization, which constitutes data corruption.
