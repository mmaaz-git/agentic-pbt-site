## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category:

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code crashes with RecursionError on inputs that appear to be valid according to the function signature
- The function signature explicitly accepts `bool` types for left/right parameters
- The infinite recursion is a clear implementation bug - the swap logic doesn't account for both masks being None
- The crash is reproducible and deterministic
- The functions are exported in __all__ making them accessible
- A RecursionError is a severe failure mode that should not happen for any valid input combination

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation explicitly states "Only one of these may be None", so having both as None violates documented constraints
- The module docstring says "This is not a public API"
- These functions appear to be internal utilities designed specifically for BooleanArray operations

#### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation clearly states "Only one of these may be None" - the bug report is calling the function with both masks as None, violating this constraint
- The bug report might be misunderstanding that these are internal functions not meant for direct scalar-scalar operations
- The module explicitly states it's "not a public API"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Even if the input violates constraints, crashing with RecursionError is poor error handling
- The function signature accepts bool types, implying scalar operations should work
- The functions are in __all__ which makes them accessible

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Arguments FOR:**
- These functions are internal utilities that work correctly in their intended use case (BooleanArray operations)
- No actual pandas user would encounter this in normal usage
- The functions are in a module marked as "not a public API"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- RecursionError is a severe crash that indicates a real implementation bug
- The fix is straightforward (add a check for both masks being None)
- Even internal functions should handle edge cases gracefully

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be clearer about what happens when both masks are None
- The error behavior should be documented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation already states the constraint clearly ("Only one of these may be None")
- This is more of an implementation issue than a documentation issue

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Supporting scalar-scalar operations could be seen as a new feature
- The bug report suggests implementing direct handling for scalar-scalar cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a crash/bug, not a missing feature
- The function signature already claims to support bool inputs

### Final Assessment:

This is a **BUG**. While the documentation states that only one mask may be None, the code should handle this constraint violation gracefully rather than crashing with infinite recursion. The proper behavior would be to either:

1. Raise a clear TypeError/ValueError when both masks are None (as suggested in the bug report)
2. Handle the scalar-scalar case directly

The current behavior (infinite recursion leading to RecursionError) is unacceptable even for constraint violations. The functions are accessible via pandas.core.ops and are in __all__, making them semi-public at minimum. Even if they were fully internal, crashing with RecursionError is a bug that should be fixed.
