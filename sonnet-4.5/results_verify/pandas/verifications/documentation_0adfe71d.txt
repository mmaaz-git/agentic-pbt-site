Documentation Analysis for pandas.read_csv Engine Behavior

Based on the official pandas documentation and related resources, here are the key findings:

1. Engine Parameter Documentation:
   - The documentation lists three possible engines: 'c', 'python', and 'pyarrow'
   - 'c' engine is described as "faster"
   - 'python' engine is described as "more feature-complete"
   - 'pyarrow' engine is experimental with multithreading support
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly state that all engines should produce identical results for the same input

2. skip_blank_lines Parameter:
   - Default value is True
   - Documentation states: "skip over blank lines rather than interpreting as NaN values"
   - The documentation does NOT provide a precise definition of what constitutes a "blank line"
   - Specifically, it does not clarify whether a quoted empty string ("") is considered a blank line

3. Notable Documentation Gaps:
   - No explicit guarantee that different engines produce identical results
   - No clear definition of "blank line" versus "empty field" in CSV context
   - No documentation about how quoted empty strings should be handled
   - No mention of potential behavioral differences between engines regarding empty values

4. Related Issues and Discussions:
   - GitHub issue #21131 from 2018 documented similar inconsistencies between engines
   - That issue showed C engine treating empty fields as NaN while Python engine treated them as string 'nan'
   - The issue was apparently resolved in a later version, suggesting pandas developers consider engine consistency important

5. CSV Standard Considerations:
   - In standard CSV format, "" represents an empty string field, not a blank line
   - A blank line would be a line with no content at all (just newline)
   - The distinction between empty quoted fields and blank lines is meaningful in CSV

Conclusion:
The documentation does not explicitly specify that engines must produce identical results, nor does it clearly define how quoted empty strings should be handled with skip_blank_lines. This creates ambiguity about whether the observed behavior is a bug or undefined behavior.
