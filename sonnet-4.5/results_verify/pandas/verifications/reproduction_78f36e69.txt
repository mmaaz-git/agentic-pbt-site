## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug occurs when using `pd.cut()` with data containing denormalized floating-point values.

### Verification Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test passes when run generally (likely because hypothesis doesn't generate denormalized floats in the test range), but fails with the specific input.

2. **Specific Failing Case**:
   - Input: `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.225073858507e-311]` with `bins=2`
   - Error: `ValueError: missing values must be missing in the same location both left and right sides`
   - Additional warning: `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide` from numpy

3. **Denormalized Float Verification**:
   - The value `-2.225073858507e-311` is indeed a denormalized (subnormal) float
   - It is smaller than `sys.float_info.min` (2.2250738585072014e-308), which is the smallest normal float
   - The hex representation shows it's a subnormal value: `-0x0.004189374bc6ap-1022`

4. **Additional Testing**:
   - When using explicit bins (e.g., `[-1e-300, 0, 1e-300]`), the function works correctly
   - With normal data ranges (e.g., `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]`), the function works correctly

The bug is confirmed: `pd.cut()` fails when automatically calculating bins for data with extremely small ranges (denormalized floats), producing a confusing error message rather than handling the edge case gracefully or providing a clear error about numerical limitations.
