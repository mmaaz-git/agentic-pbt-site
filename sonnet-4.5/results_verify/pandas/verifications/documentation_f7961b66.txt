## Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer

### Function Documentation
The function `length_of_indexer` has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Returns: int
- No explicit documentation about behavior with negative values
- No explicit documentation about what "expected length" means

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is described as returning "the expected length of target[indexer]". This is a mathematical operation that should return how many elements would be selected by applying the indexer to the target.

2. **No Negative Length Documentation**: The documentation does not explicitly state whether negative lengths are allowed or expected. However, the concept of "length" in mathematics and computer science is universally understood to be non-negative (0 or positive).

3. **Related pandas Documentation**:
   - pandas generally follows Python/NumPy slice semantics
   - `.iloc` allows out-of-bounds indexing for slices (conforms with Python/NumPy)
   - pandas supports negative indexing (negative integers as positions from end)
   - Historical bug reports show there were issues with `length_of_indexer` returning incorrect values

4. **Mathematical Convention**: The term "length" has a well-established meaning in mathematics and programming - it represents a count or size, which by definition cannot be negative. This is a fundamental invariant across all programming languages and mathematical contexts.

5. **No Special Case Documentation**: The documentation does not specify any special behavior for:
   - Empty slices (start >= stop)
   - Out-of-bounds slices
   - Slices on empty targets

### Conclusion on Documentation
The documentation is minimal and does not explicitly address the behavior for edge cases. However, the function claims to return a "length", and lengths are universally non-negative by definition. The absence of documentation stating that negative lengths are valid or expected suggests that negative return values would violate the implicit contract of what a "length" function should return.
