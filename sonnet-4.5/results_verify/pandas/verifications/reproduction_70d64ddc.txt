## Bug Reproduction Report

### Bug Claim
The bug report claims that `read_clipboard()` and `to_clipboard()` perform identical encoding validation but raise different exception types:
- `read_clipboard()` raises `NotImplementedError` for non-UTF-8 encodings
- `to_clipboard()` raises `ValueError` for non-UTF-8 encodings

### Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described. The test results show:

1. **Basic Reproduction Test:**
   - `read_clipboard('ascii')` raises: `NotImplementedError` with message "reading from clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding"
   - `to_clipboard('ascii')` raises: `ValueError` with message "clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding"

2. **Multiple Encoding Test:**
   All non-UTF-8 encodings tested (ascii, latin-1, iso-8859-1, cp1252, utf-16) exhibited the same behavior:
   - `read_clipboard`: NotImplementedError
   - `to_clipboard`: ValueError

3. **UTF-8 Variants Test:**
   Both functions correctly accept UTF-8 in various forms (utf-8, UTF-8, utf8, UTF8)

### Source Code Verification

I examined the source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/clipboards.py`:

**Line 78-79 (read_clipboard):**
```python
if encoding is not None and encoding.lower().replace("-", "") != "utf8":
    raise NotImplementedError("reading from clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding")
```

**Line 160-161 (to_clipboard):**
```python
if encoding is not None and encoding.lower().replace("-", "") != "utf8":
    raise ValueError("clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding")
```

### Conclusion

The bug is **CONFIRMED**. Both functions:
1. Perform the identical validation check: `encoding.lower().replace("-", "") != "utf8"`
2. Reject the same set of encodings
3. But raise different exception types for the exact same validation failure

This creates an inconsistent API where users must handle different exception types for what is conceptually the same error condition.
