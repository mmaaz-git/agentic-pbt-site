## Documentation Analysis for length_of_indexer

### Function Documentation
The function `length_of_indexer` has minimal documentation:
```python
def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
    """
    Return the expected length of target[indexer]

    Returns
    -------
    int
    """
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Purpose**: The docstring clearly states the function should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"

2. **Return Type**: Explicitly documented as returning an `int`

3. **API Status**:
   - The function is in `pandas.core.indexers` (internal module)
   - Not exposed in the main pandas namespace
   - Used internally by pandas for indexing operations

4. **Python Slicing Behavior** (from Python docs):
   - "If i is greater than or equal to j, the slice is empty" (for positive step)
   - Empty slices have length 0 in Python
   - Python never returns negative lengths for slice operations

5. **Mathematical Properties of Length**:
   - Length is a non-negative measure
   - The length of any collection, including empty ones, is >= 0
   - Negative lengths violate fundamental mathematical properties

### Documentation Gaps vs Actual Behavior

1. **No mention of negative returns**: The documentation doesn't specify that negative values might be returned, which would be unusual for a length function

2. **"Expected length"**: The phrase "expected length" implies it should match what `len(target[indexer])` would return

3. **Integer return type**: While the function correctly returns integers, returning negative integers for a length function violates the semantic meaning of "length"

### Internal Usage Context
The function is used internally in pandas for:
- Index validation in `indexing.py`
- Value assignment checks in `utils.py`

These use cases expect accurate length calculations that match NumPy slicing behavior.

### Conclusion
The documentation, while brief, clearly indicates the function should return the "expected length" of a slicing operation. In Python and NumPy, empty slices have length 0, never negative values. The current behavior of returning negative values violates:
1. The documented purpose (expected length should match actual length)
2. Mathematical properties of length
3. Python's own slicing semantics
