## Analysis of Bug Report for pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state that the function must return non-negative values. One could argue that negative return values are a valid implementation choice if they serve some internal purpose within pandas. Perhaps negative values could indicate special cases or error conditions that the caller should handle.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function is named `length_of_indexer` and its docstring states it returns "the expected length of target[indexer]". The concept of "length" is universally understood to be non-negative across all programming languages and mathematics. A negative length violates this fundamental semantic meaning. The fact that NumPy and Python return 0 for empty slices establishes the expected behavior. The function should match the actual length that `len(target[indexer])` would return.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered an edge case that rarely occurs in practice. Most users wouldn't slice beyond array bounds or use backwards slices with positive steps. The function might be internal to pandas and not intended for direct user consumption. If the negative values are handled correctly elsewhere in the pandas codebase and never surface to users, fixing this might be unnecessary complexity.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The function is part of the public API in `pandas.core.indexers`. It returns semantically incorrect values that violate the mathematical definition of "length". This could cause crashes or incorrect behavior in code that reasonably assumes lengths are non-negative. The fix is trivial (adding `max(0, ...)`) and wouldn't add significant complexity. The bug affects multiple common scenarios, not just obscure edge cases.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to clarify that the function returns "a value indicating the expected length, which may be negative for invalid slices". This would make the current behavior officially documented. The minimal docstring doesn't explicitly promise non-negative values.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function name and purpose clearly indicate it should return a length, and lengths are inherently non-negative. Documenting that a "length" function can return negative values would be confusing and counter-intuitive. The issue is with the implementation, not the documentation. The documentation correctly describes what the function should do; the implementation is what's wrong.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that properly handling empty slices by returning 0 instead of negative values is a new feature rather than a bug fix. The current implementation might not have been designed to handle these edge cases, and adding support for them could be seen as extending functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not adding new functionality but fixing incorrect behavior. The function already claims to return the length of what the indexer would select. Returning the correct length (0 for empty results) is not a new feature but a correction of existing functionality. The expected behavior already exists in Python/NumPy; this is about conforming to established semantics.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function returns mathematically invalid values (negative lengths) that contradict the fundamental definition of "length". It doesn't match the actual behavior of slicing (which returns empty sequences with length 0). The discrepancy between `length_of_indexer(slice, target)` and `len(target[slice])` is clearly incorrect. The function name and docstring promise to return a length, which must be non-negative. This could cause crashes in code that allocates arrays based on the returned length or assumes lengths are non-negative.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if negative values were intentionally designed to signal special conditions, but there's no evidence of this in the documentation or code. The function's purpose is straightforward - return the length of the indexed result.

## Overall Consideration

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function `length_of_indexer` is named to return a length and documented to return "the expected length of target[indexer]". By mathematical definition and universal programming convention, a length cannot be negative. The function returns -1, -2, -5, and even -90 in cases where the actual length is 0.

The bug report correctly identifies that the formula `(stop - start + step - 1) // step` produces negative values when `start >= stop`, which occurs for empty slices. The proposed fix of using `max(0, ...)` is appropriate and minimal. The reproduction code confirms the bug exists exactly as described.

While the documentation is minimal, the semantic meaning of "length" is unambiguous. This is not a documentation issue, feature request, or trivial edge case. It's a clear violation of the fundamental invariant that lengths are non-negative. Code that uses this function could reasonably expect non-negative values and fail when receiving negative ones. The fact that NumPy and Python handle these slices correctly (returning empty sequences with length 0) establishes the expected behavior that pandas should match.
