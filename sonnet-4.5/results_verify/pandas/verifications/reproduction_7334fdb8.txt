## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the behavior described in the bug report. The technical details are accurate:

### Confirmed Behavior

1. When all values are masked (mask = all True):
   - `sum()` returns 0.0 (with default min_count=0)
   - `prod()` returns 1.0 (with default min_count=0)
   - `min()` returns NA
   - `max()` returns NA (not tested but confirmed in source)
   - `mean()` returns NA

2. The hypothesis test fails exactly as described, because it expects sum() to return NA but it returns 0.0.

3. The specific failing case `values=[0.0], mask_bits=[True]` produces sum = 0.0 instead of NA.

### Important Discovery

When I tested with `min_count=1`, both sum() and prod() correctly return NA when all values are masked. This demonstrates that the behavior is configurable and controlled by the min_count parameter.

### Code Analysis

The implementation shows:
- min(), max(), and mean() have explicit checks for all-masked cases and return NA
- sum() and prod() delegate to _reductions() which uses min_count logic
- With min_count=0 (default), np.sum/np.prod are called with where=~mask, which results in the identity element (0 for sum, 1 for prod) when no values pass the mask

### Technical Accuracy

The bug report's technical analysis is correct:
- The code paths are accurate
- The line numbers referenced are correct
- The explanation of why this happens (identity elements from numpy) is accurate
- The proposed fix would make the behavior consistent

However, this behavior appears to be **intentional and documented**, not a bug.
