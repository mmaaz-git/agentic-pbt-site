DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. FUNCTION LOCATION AND STATUS:
   - The function pandas.util.capitalize_first_letter exists in pandas/util/__init__.py (line 28-29)
   - It is NOT documented in the official pandas API documentation
   - It has NO docstring or inline comments
   - It does NOT appear in pandas.pydata.org documentation
   - This appears to be an internal/undocumented utility function

2. FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION:
   ```python
   def capitalize_first_letter(s):
       return s[:1].upper() + s[1:]
   ```

3. LACK OF SPECIFICATION:
   - No documentation exists specifying the expected behavior
   - No documentation about Unicode handling
   - No documentation about length preservation requirements
   - No documentation about suffix preservation requirements
   - Function name implies it should "capitalize first letter" but doesn't specify behavior for edge cases

4. PYTHON'S STANDARD UNICODE BEHAVIOR:
   - Python's str.upper() follows Unicode standards where some characters expand to multiple characters:
     - 'ß'.upper() -> 'SS' (German eszett)
     - 'ﬁ'.upper() -> 'FI' (ligature fi)
     - 'ﬂ'.upper() -> 'FL' (ligature fl)
   - This is correct Unicode behavior according to Unicode case mapping standards
   - Python's str.capitalize() handles this differently: 'ß' -> 'Ss', 'ßeta' -> 'Sseta'

5. FUNCTION NAME IMPLICATIONS:
   - The name "capitalize_first_letter" strongly suggests:
     a) It should capitalize (not uppercase) the first letter
     b) It should only affect the first letter, not the rest of the string
     c) A "letter" is typically understood as a single character
   - The current implementation uses upper() not capitalize(), which are different operations

6. CONCLUSIONS:
   - The function is undocumented, so there's no explicit specification to violate
   - However, the function name creates reasonable expectations that are not met
   - The behavior with Unicode is technically correct from Python's perspective but surprising given the function name
   - Without documentation, users would reasonably expect length preservation based on the function name
