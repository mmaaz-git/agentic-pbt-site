## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution Summary

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report. The test execution confirms:

1. **Basic Bug Reproduction**: âœ“ CONFIRMED
   - Creating a DataFrame with surrogate character '\ud800' works fine
   - Calling `df.__dataframe__()` succeeds without error
   - Calling `interchange.from_dataframe()` fails with: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\ud800' in position 24: surrogates not allowed`

2. **Surrogate Character Test Cases**: ALL FAIL
   - '\ud800' (high surrogate alone): UnicodeEncodeError
   - '\udc00' (low surrogate alone): UnicodeEncodeError
   - '\ud800\udc00' (surrogate pair): UnicodeEncodeError
   - 'normal\ud800text' (surrogate in middle): UnicodeEncodeError

### Technical Details

The error occurs exactly at the line specified in the bug report:
- File: `/pandas/core/interchange/column.py`
- Line: 351
- Code: `b.extend(obj.encode(encoding="utf-8"))`

The error happens because:
1. Pandas allows creating DataFrames with strings containing surrogate characters
2. The interchange protocol attempts to encode these strings to UTF-8
3. UTF-8 specification explicitly forbids encoding surrogate characters (U+D800-U+DFFF)
4. Python's encode() method correctly raises UnicodeEncodeError for surrogates

### Round-trip Property Violation

The bug report correctly identifies that this violates the round-trip property:
- Input: DataFrame with surrogate characters can be created
- Export: `__dataframe__()` succeeds
- Import: `from_dataframe()` fails with UnicodeEncodeError

This is indeed an inconsistency in the API where the export suggests success but the import fails.
