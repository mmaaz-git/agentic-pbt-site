## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

1. **Specific Failing Case (window_size=-1, num_values=2)**:
   - Result: start=[0, 1], end=[0, 0]
   - Verification: end[1]=0 < start[1]=1 (CONFIRMED)
   - The bug report's assertion is correct

2. **Extended Testing with Negative Window Sizes**:
   - window_size=-5: Results in end < start for indices 1-4
   - window_size=-2: Results in end < start for indices 2-4
   - window_size=-1: Results in end < start for indices 1-4
   - All negative window sizes produce invalid bounds where end < start

3. **Positive Window Sizes (Expected Behavior)**:
   - window_size=0: end == start (empty windows)
   - window_size=1: end = start + 1 (single element forward)
   - window_size=2: end = start + 2 (two elements forward)
   - All positive values maintain end >= start invariant

4. **Practical Impact**:
   - With positive window_size=2: Produces expected forward-looking sums
   - With negative window_size=-1: All results are NaN (no valid data in windows)
   - The invalid bounds cause rolling operations to produce meaningless results

### Technical Analysis

The implementation appears to:
1. Calculate end = start + window_size
2. Clip end values to [0, num_values]
3. When window_size is negative, this produces end < start after clipping

### Bug Report Accuracy

The bug report is technically accurate in its claims:
- Negative window_size values ARE accepted without validation
- This DOES produce bounds where end < start
- The specific test case reproduces exactly as described
- The practical impact (all NaN results) is confirmed

### Semantic Considerations

1. **Class Name Semantics**: "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" strongly implies forward-looking windows
2. **Negative Forward Window**: A negative "forward" window is semantically nonsensical
3. **User Intent**: It's unlikely any user would intentionally want negative forward windows
4. **Current Behavior**: Silently produces invalid results rather than failing fast

The bug report's technical analysis is correct, and the current behavior produces invalid window bounds that violate the expected property that end >= start for window operations.
