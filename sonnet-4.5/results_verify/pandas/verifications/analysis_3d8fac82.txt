BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
===================================

Considering each possible categorization:

1. BUG
------
Arguments FOR:
- Silent data corruption occurs with default settings
- Float64 values lose precision without warning
- Violates reasonable user expectations about data preservation
- Inconsistent with Python's standard json module which preserves full precision
- The default value (10) is insufficient for the data type (float64 needs ~15-17 digits)
- Users have no indication that their data is being corrupted

Arguments AGAINST:
- The behavior is technically documented (double_precision defaults to 10)
- The function works as designed, just with a poor default choice

Assessment: STRONG case for BUG

2. INVALID
----------
Arguments FOR:
- The function behavior matches its documentation exactly
- The parameter double_precision=10 is clearly documented
- Users can set double_precision=15 if they need more precision

Arguments AGAINST:
- Silent data corruption is a serious issue regardless of documentation
- Users reasonably expect lossless serialization by default
- The documentation doesn't warn about precision loss
- Default behavior violates principle of least surprise

Assessment: WEAK case for INVALID

3. WONTFIX
----------
Arguments FOR:
- Changing the default might break backward compatibility
- Users who need precision can explicitly set double_precision=15
- Some users might depend on the current behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- Data corruption is too serious to ignore
- The fix is simple and improves data integrity
- Most users would benefit from better defaults

Assessment: WEAK case for WONTFIX

4. FEATURE_REQUEST
------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could be seen as requesting "better defaults" rather than fixing a bug
- The current behavior is intentional, just suboptimal

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is about fixing data corruption, not adding new functionality
- The capability already exists (double_precision=15), just needs better default

Assessment: WEAK case for FEATURE_REQUEST

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
--------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The code works as designed, but documentation could warn about precision loss
- Adding a warning about float64 precision requirements would help users
- Could document that double_precision=15 is recommended for float64

Arguments AGAINST:
- Documentation alone doesn't fix the data corruption issue
- The problem is the default behavior, not just lack of warning
- Users shouldn't have to read warnings to avoid data corruption

Assessment: MODERATE case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX (as alternative if not considered a BUG)

FINAL ANALYSIS
--------------
This is fundamentally about DEFAULT BEHAVIOR that causes SILENT DATA CORRUPTION. While the behavior is technically documented, the consequences are severe:

1. Data integrity is compromised by default
2. No warning is given to users
3. The corruption is silent and may go unnoticed
4. It violates reasonable expectations about serialization

The fact that the behavior is documented does not excuse silent data corruption. Many bugs are "working as designed" but still need fixing when the design causes harm.

The strongest categorization is BUG, with DOCUMENTATION_FIX as a fallback if backward compatibility concerns prevent changing the default.
