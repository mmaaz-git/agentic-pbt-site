BUG CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS

I will analyze this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Incorrect report where code works as designed):
Arguments FOR:
- The docstring does say "Hash_key for string key to encode" which could be interpreted as only for strings
- The implementation consistently ignores hash_key for all numeric types

Arguments AGAINST:
- The function accepts the parameter without any warning or error
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state the limitation
- The behavior is inconsistent - same parameter works differently for different input types
- Users have reasonable expectation that parameters should work consistently
- The API contract is violated - accepting a parameter implies it will be used

Verdict: UNLIKELY to be INVALID - the behavior violates reasonable API expectations

2. WONTFIX (Trivial or uninteresting issue):
Arguments FOR:
- Most users probably don't customize hash_key anyway (uses default)
- The current behavior produces consistent hashes for numeric arrays
- Changing it might break backward compatibility

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is a fundamental API inconsistency, not a trivial edge case
- Users who do need custom hash_keys are completely blocked with no workaround
- The issue affects core functionality of a widely-used function
- Silent parameter ignoring is a serious API design flaw

Verdict: UNLIKELY to be WONTFIX - this is a significant API inconsistency

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
Arguments FOR:
- Supporting hash_key for numeric arrays could be seen as a new feature
- The original design may have intentionally excluded numeric types

Arguments AGAINST:
- The function already accepts the parameter for all inputs
- This is about making existing parameter work consistently, not adding new functionality
- The API already claims to support this (accepts the parameter)

Verdict: UNLIKELY to be FEATURE_REQUEST - the API already accepts the parameter

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation doesn't match code behavior):
Arguments FOR:
- The documentation is ambiguous about when hash_key applies
- Adding clear documentation about the limitation would resolve user confusion
- The code might be working as originally intended, just poorly documented
- The phrase "for string key to encode" might have meant "only for string data"

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is more than just unclear documentation - it's inconsistent behavior
- Even with documentation, silently ignoring parameters is poor API design
- The function should at least warn when hash_key won't be used

Verdict: POSSIBLE as DOCUMENTATION_FIX - but the underlying behavior is still problematic

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
Arguments FOR:
- The function accepts a parameter but silently ignores it for most inputs
- This violates the principle of least surprise in API design
- The behavior is inconsistent between data types with no clear reason
- No warning or error is raised when the parameter is ignored
- Users cannot achieve the intended functionality (custom hashing for numeric arrays)
- The API contract is broken - accepting a parameter implies it will be used

Arguments AGAINST:
- The current behavior might be intentional for performance or design reasons
- The docstring does mention "string" which could imply limited scope

Verdict: MOST LIKELY a BUG - the API behavior is fundamentally inconsistent

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is most likely a BUG. The function accepts a parameter for all input types but only uses it for object arrays, creating an inconsistent and confusing API. Even if this was the original intent, it represents a design flaw that should be fixed rather than just documented. At minimum, this would be a DOCUMENTATION_FIX, but the silent parameter ignoring and API inconsistency strongly suggest this is a legitimate BUG that should be addressed in the code.
