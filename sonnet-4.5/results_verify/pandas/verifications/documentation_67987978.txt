DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Function Documentation
The _parse_datetime function has no direct public documentation. It is an internal function (indicated by the leading underscore) used within the sas7bdat module.

## Related Documentation Found

### 1. Source Code Comments
The only documentation for _parse_datetime is implicit from its usage context and the docstring of _convert_datetimes (lines 82-98):
- States: "Convert to Timestamp if possible, otherwise to datetime.datetime"
- Notes: "SAS float64 lacks precision for more than ms resolution so the fit to datetime.datetime is ok"
- Parameters specify unit can be 'd' for dates or 's' for datetimes

### 2. SAS Date/Datetime Representation
From official sources and documentation:
- SAS stores datetime values as seconds since January 1, 1960, midnight
- SAS stores date values as days since January 1, 1960
- SAS can represent dates from 1582 AD to approximately year 20,000 AD
- This is a much wider range than Python's datetime module (years 1-9999)

### 3. Known SAS Date Issues
From SAS documentation and community sources:
- Year 9999 is commonly used as a sentinel value for "ongoing" periods
- Import/export issues exist with year 9999 dates between SAS and Excel
- Leap year calculation differences exist for years 4000, 8000
- After year 8000, calendar systems between Unix and SAS deviate

## Key Finding: No Error Handling Specification

The documentation and code do NOT specify:
1. What should happen when a SAS datetime value represents a date beyond Python's datetime.max
2. Whether OverflowError is expected behavior or should be handled
3. Whether the function should return pd.NaT for out-of-range values
4. Any limits on valid input ranges

## Pandas' General Approach
Looking at the existing code pattern:
- The function already returns pd.NaT for NaN inputs (line 68-69)
- This establishes a pattern of returning pd.NaT for "unparseable" values
- The parallel _convert_datetimes function mentions converting "if possible"

## Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly state how out-of-range dates should be handled. However:
1. SAS legitimately supports dates beyond year 9999
2. The function already has a pattern of returning pd.NaT for unparseable values (NaN)
3. Crashing on valid SAS data appears unintentional
4. The docstring of _convert_datetimes says "Convert to Timestamp if possible", implying graceful handling when not possible
