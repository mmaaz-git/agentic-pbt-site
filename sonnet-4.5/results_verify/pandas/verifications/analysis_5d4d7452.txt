Bug Report Triage Analysis
===========================

Considering each possible categorization:

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
-----------------------
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The function explicitly promises to "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- For slice(1, 0, None), Python returns an empty list with length 0
- The function returns -1, which is incorrect
- Negative lengths violate fundamental Python semantics - len() never returns negative values
- The discrepancy could cause downstream issues in pandas where negative lengths are unexpected
- The fix is straightforward: wrap the result in max(0, ...) to ensure non-negative values
- This is a logic error, not a documentation or feature issue

**Evidence supporting BUG:**
- Clear reproduction showing -1 != 0
- Property-based testing reveals systematic failure for all empty slices
- Python's slice behavior is well-established and should be matched

INVALID
-------
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue this is internal function behavior not meant for public use
- However, the docstring clearly states expected behavior that isn't met
- Internal functions still need to be correct for pandas to work properly
- NOT INVALID - the function has clear semantics it violates

WONTFIX
--------
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Could be considered an edge case (empty slices)
- However, empty slices are common in data manipulation
- Negative lengths could cause real issues in production code
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- NOT WONTFIX - this is a meaningful bug with practical impact

DOCUMENTATION_FIX
------------------
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Documentation could specify that negative values are allowed for empty slices
- However, this would be counterintuitive and break Python conventions
- The function name implies it matches actual indexing behavior
- NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the code is wrong, not the documentation

FEATURE_REQUEST
----------------
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could frame proper empty slice handling as a new feature
- However, this is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already handles slices, just incorrectly for this case
- NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - this is fixing a bug, not adding features

Final Assessment
----------------
This is clearly a **BUG**:

1. The function violates its documented contract
2. It returns negative lengths which violate Python conventions
3. The issue is reproducible and systematic
4. The fix is straightforward and correct
5. This could cause real issues in production pandas code
6. Empty slices are common enough to matter

The function should return 0 for empty slices, not negative values. The proposed fix using max(0, ...) is appropriate and maintains backward compatibility for all valid cases while fixing the bug.
