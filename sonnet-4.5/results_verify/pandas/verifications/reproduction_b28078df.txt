REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT: pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.mean()

SUMMARY:
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and demonstrates that pandas GroupBy.mean() can violate the mathematical invariant that min ≤ mean ≤ max.

HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
- Ran the provided hypothesis test with property-based testing
- Test FAILED on first run, finding a counterexample after checking only 19 examples
- Failure case: DataFrame with 19 identical values of 441506.140195
- Error: mean 441506.1401946863 exceeded max 441506.14019468636
- This confirms the bug exists and can be found with various inputs

SPECIFIC EXAMPLE REPRODUCTION:
- Tested the exact example from the bug report
- Input: DataFrame with 35 identical values of 479349.0592509031
- Results:
  * Min:  479349.059250903083012
  * Max:  479349.059250903083012
  * Mean: 479349.059250903141219
  * Mean > Max: True
  * Difference: 5.82e-11

VERIFICATION:
- Confirmed all 35 values in the group are identical
- Confirmed min == max (as expected for identical values)
- Confirmed mean exceeds max by approximately 5.82×10⁻¹¹
- The mean of identical values should mathematically equal those values

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
The bug appears to be caused by floating-point accumulation errors during summation. When pandas sums 35 identical floating-point values and divides by 35, small rounding errors accumulate, causing the result to slightly exceed the original value. This is a known limitation of floating-point arithmetic when using naive summation algorithms.

The bug is reproducible and consistent across different test cases with various group sizes and values, confirming it's a systematic issue rather than a random occurrence.
