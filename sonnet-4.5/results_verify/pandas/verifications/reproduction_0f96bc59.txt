REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

The bug report describes two issues with FixedForwardWindowIndexer when given negative window_size values:

1. NEGATIVE WINDOW SIZES VIOLATE start[i] <= end[i] INVARIANT:
   - When window_size is negative (e.g., -1, -10, -100) and num_values > 1, the returned window bounds violate the invariant that start[i] should be <= end[i]
   - For example, with window_size=-1 and num_values=2, we get start=[0, 1] and end=[0, 0], where start[1]=1 > end[1]=0
   - This happens because the code calculates end = start + window_size, which for negative window_size results in end values less than start

2. EXTREMELY LARGE NEGATIVE VALUES CAUSE OVERFLOW ERROR:
   - When window_size is an extremely large negative value like -9_223_372_036_854_775_809 (which is beyond the int64 range), the code crashes with "OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long"
   - This occurs when numpy tries to convert the Python int to a C long for array operations
   - The error occurs at: end = start + self.window_size in line 341 of objects.py

VERIFICATION:
Both issues were successfully reproduced:
- The Hypothesis property-based test found both issues automatically
- Direct reproduction confirmed the OverflowError with the exact input from the bug report
- Additional testing confirmed the start > end issue occurs for all negative window sizes when num_values > 1

The bug report's description of the problem and the proposed fix are accurate.
