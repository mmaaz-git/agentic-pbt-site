## Documentation Findings for pandas.read_csv skip_blank_lines Parameter

### Official Documentation
The official pandas documentation for `read_csv` states that the `skip_blank_lines` parameter:
- Has a default value of `True`
- When True, will "skip over blank lines rather than interpreting as NaN values"

### Key Documentation Gaps
1. The documentation does NOT explicitly define what constitutes a "blank line"
2. It does not specify whether lines containing only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) are considered "blank"
3. There is no mention of round-trip guarantees or expectations when using to_csv() and read_csv() together
4. No explicit statement about data preservation expectations

### Historical Context
GitHub issue #10728 from 2015 reported this exact behavior as a bug where whitespace-only lines were not being skipped properly when skip_blank_lines=True. That issue was closed by pull request #10825, suggesting the maintainers considered it a bug that needed fixing at that time.

### Current Behavior vs Documentation
The current implementation treats lines containing only whitespace as "blank" and skips them by default. However, this specific behavior is not documented. A user reading the documentation would not know that:
- A CSV line with just spaces will be skipped
- A CSV line with just tabs will be skipped
- This creates an asymmetry with to_csv() which writes whitespace values

### Documentation Ambiguity
The term "blank lines" is ambiguous and could reasonably mean either:
1. Lines with absolutely no content (truly empty lines)
2. Lines that appear blank visually (including whitespace-only lines)

The documentation does not disambiguate between these two interpretations, leaving the actual behavior as an implementation detail rather than a documented feature.
