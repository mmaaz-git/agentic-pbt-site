## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `length_of_indexer` function has clear documentation in the source code (lines 290-297):

```python
def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
    """
    Return the expected length of target[indexer]

    Returns
    -------
    int
    """
```

The docstring explicitly states the function returns "the expected length of target[indexer]". This is an unambiguous contract that the function should return the same value as `len(target[indexer])`.

### Python's Slice Behavior
Through empirical testing, Python's built-in slice behavior is consistent and well-defined:
1. **Slicing ALWAYS returns a valid sequence with non-negative length**
2. When negative indices exceed the sequence bounds, Python handles them gracefully:
   - `[][:-1]` returns `[]` with length 0 (not -1)
   - `[][:-10]` returns `[]` with length 0 (not -10)
3. This behavior is fundamental to Python's design - lengths cannot be negative

### Contract Violation
The function violates its documented contract in several ways:
1. **Return type violation**: The function is typed to return `int`, and while -1 is technically an int, the semantic meaning of "length" in Python is always non-negative
2. **Behavioral mismatch**: The docstring promises to return "the expected length of target[indexer]", but it returns a different value than `len(target[indexer])`

### Usage Context
The function is used internally within pandas for validation (line 175 of the same file):
```python
if len(value) != length_of_indexer(indexer, values) and values.ndim == 1:
```
This usage expects `length_of_indexer` to accurately predict the length after slicing. Returning negative values here could lead to incorrect validation logic.

### Related Functions
The codebase contains other indexing utilities that handle negative indices correctly:
- `maybe_convert_indices` (line 239) properly converts negative indices to positive ones
- The comment on line 191 acknowledges "-1 is allowed for indicating missing values" but this is in a different context (validate_indices)

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly establishes that `length_of_indexer` should return the same value as `len(target[indexer])`. Python's core behavior guarantees that slice lengths are always non-negative. The function's current implementation violates both its explicit documentation and Python's fundamental semantics about sequence lengths.
