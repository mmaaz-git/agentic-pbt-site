TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Consideration for each possible categorization:

1. BUG
   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation explicitly promises "equal-sized buckets"
   - The current behavior violates this fundamental promise
   - Users have a reasonable expectation based on the function name (qcut = quantile cut)
   - The uneven distribution (3, 1, 1) is severe, not a minor imbalance
   - The function's primary purpose is undermined by this behavior

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code works as mechanically designed (drops duplicate edges)
   - duplicates='drop' is an optional parameter, not the default
   - The behavior is deterministic and consistent

2. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - The code behavior is reasonable from an implementation perspective
   - Simply dropping duplicate bin edges is a valid approach
   - The real issue is that documentation doesn't warn about consequences
   - Adding a warning would resolve user confusion
   - The bug report itself suggests documentation as the fix

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The core promise of "equal-sized buckets" is violated
   - Documentation alone doesn't fix the broken functionality
   - Users need the equal-sized property for statistical validity

3. FEATURE_REQUEST
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could be seen as requesting new functionality (smart redistribution after dropping)
   - The current simple implementation could be considered sufficient
   - Asking for "better" handling of edge cases

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Not asking for new functionality, but for existing promises to be kept
   - "Equal-sized buckets" is already advertised as the function's purpose
   - This is about fixing broken behavior, not adding features

4. WONTFIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - Edge case with duplicate values in small datasets
   - Users can work around by using duplicates='raise' and handling manually
   - Changing behavior might break existing code

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Not an obscure edge case - happens with any data containing duplicates
   - Violates the core purpose of the function
   - The severity of imbalance (3, 1, 1) is significant

5. INVALID
   Arguments FOR:
   - The parameter explicitly says it will "drop non-uniques"
   - User chose to use duplicates='drop' knowing edges would be dropped

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The main documentation promises "equal-sized buckets"
   - Reasonable expectation that dropping duplicates wouldn't break core functionality
   - The test correctly identifies a violation of expected behavior

RECOMMENDATION ANALYSIS:
========================
This is primarily a DOCUMENTATION_FIX issue. Here's why:

1. The implementation is straightforward and works as mechanically designed
2. Changing the algorithm to redistribute after dropping would be a significant change
3. The current behavior might be relied upon by existing users
4. The core issue is unmet expectations due to incomplete documentation
5. The bug reporter themselves recommends documentation as the fix
6. Adding a clear warning about uneven bucket sizes with duplicates='drop' would
   prevent user confusion while preserving backward compatibility

The behavior is surprising and problematic, but given that:
- It only occurs with the optional duplicates='drop' parameter
- The default behavior (duplicates='raise') alerts users to the issue
- A documentation warning would adequately inform users of the trade-off

This should be categorized as DOCUMENTATION_FIX.
