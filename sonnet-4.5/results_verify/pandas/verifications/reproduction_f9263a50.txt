## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Case Verification

1. **Basic Reproduction:**
   - Confirmed: Empty DataFrame with orient='split' changes index type from int64 to float64
   - Original: RangeIndex(start=0, stop=0, step=1) with dtype=int64
   - After round-trip: Index([], dtype='float64')
   - The bug report's claim is technically accurate about the type change

2. **Behavior Across Different Orient Options:**
   - orient='split': Changes int64 to float64 (CONFIRMED)
   - orient='records': Preserves int64 (works correctly)
   - orient='index': Preserves int64 (works correctly)
   - orient='columns': Changes int64 to float64 (also affected)
   - orient='values': Preserves int64 (works correctly)
   - orient='table': Preserves int64 (works correctly)

3. **Non-empty DataFrame Behavior:**
   - With data present, orient='split' correctly preserves int64 index type
   - The issue ONLY occurs with empty DataFrames

4. **Hypothesis Test Results:**
   - The hypothesis test found multiple issues, including the empty DataFrame case
   - Also found an unrelated overflow issue with very large negative integers (-9223372036854775809)
   - The test with check_dtype=False still fails because assert_frame_equal checks inferred_type, not just dtype

5. **Impact Assessment:**
   - The issue is real and reproducible
   - It affects empty DataFrames with orient='split' and orient='columns'
   - When JSON contains "index":[], pandas cannot infer the type and defaults to float64
   - This is a type inference issue during deserialization of empty arrays

### Technical Analysis

The root cause appears to be that when read_json encounters an empty index array in 'split' format, it has no values to infer the dtype from and defaults to float64. This is different from creating a fresh empty DataFrame which gets a RangeIndex with int64 dtype by default.
