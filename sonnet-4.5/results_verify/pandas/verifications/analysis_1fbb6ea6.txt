Bug Report Triage Analysis
===========================

## Category: BUG

### Why this should be BUG:
1. **Clear Logic Error**: The error message has swapped variables, displaying "must be one of {invalid_value}, got {valid_values}" instead of the correct "must be one of {valid_values}, got {invalid_value}"
2. **Violates Python Conventions**: Standard Python error messages follow "expected X, got Y" format, not "expected Y, got X"
3. **User Impact**: Creates confusion when debugging, as the message literally says "must be one of invalid" which is nonsensical
4. **Easy to Fix**: Simple variable swap in the f-string fixes the issue
5. **Reproducible**: Consistently reproducible with any invalid methodtype value

### Why this might be INVALID:
- The error behavior is not explicitly documented
- It's an edge case for invalid input
- **Verdict**: These don't make it invalid - the error message format follows universal conventions even if not explicitly documented

### Why this might be WONTFIX:
- It's only triggered when users provide invalid input
- Users shouldn't be passing invalid methodtype values in the first place
- **Verdict**: While triggered by invalid input, error messages should still be correct and helpful. This is not obscure enough for WONTFIX

### Why this might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The valid methodtype values aren't documented
- The error behavior for invalid values isn't documented
- **Verdict**: While documentation could be improved, the primary issue is the incorrect error message in the code, not missing documentation

### Why this might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could be seen as requesting better error messages
- **Verdict**: This is fixing a bug in existing functionality, not requesting new features. The error message exists but is incorrect

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** because:

1. **Objective Error**: The variables in the error message are demonstrably swapped
2. **Convention Violation**: Violates universal Python error message conventions
3. **User Experience**: Creates genuine confusion with nonsensical error messages
4. **Not a Design Choice**: This is clearly unintentional - no reasonable design would say "must be one of <invalid_value>"
5. **Simple Fix**: The fix is straightforward and unambiguous

The bug is neither trivial nor an enhancement request. It's a clear programming error where two variables are in the wrong positions, leading to confusing and incorrect output. While it only occurs with invalid input, error messages should still be correct and helpful for debugging.
