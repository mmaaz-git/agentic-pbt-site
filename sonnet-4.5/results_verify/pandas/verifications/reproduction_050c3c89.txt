## Bug Reproduction Report

### Hypothesis Test Results
I ran the provided Hypothesis test and it successfully detected the bug. The test failed on the first example, which was an empty DataFrame with integer columns:
- Input: Empty DataFrame with columns A and B of dtype int64
- Output: AssertionError showing that dtype changed from int64 to float64 after df.T.T

### Manual Reproduction Results
I reproduced the manual example and confirmed the bug:

1. Empty DataFrame test:
   - Created: pd.DataFrame({'A': pd.Series([], dtype='int64'), 'B': pd.Series([], dtype='int64')})
   - Original dtypes: A=int64, B=int64
   - After df.T.T: A=float64, B=float64
   - **BUG CONFIRMED**: Empty DataFrame loses int64 dtype after double transpose

2. Non-empty DataFrame test (additional test):
   - Created: pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
   - Original dtypes: A=int64, B=int64
   - After df.T.T: A=int64, B=int64
   - **NO BUG**: Non-empty DataFrame preserves int64 dtype correctly

### Key Finding
The bug specifically affects **empty DataFrames** with integer dtypes. When a DataFrame has no rows but has integer-typed columns, the double transpose operation converts the dtype from int64 to float64. This does NOT occur with non-empty DataFrames, where the dtype is correctly preserved.

### Impact
This violates the mathematical property that transpose should be an involution (T(T(x)) = x), at least in terms of dtype preservation. The data values themselves are preserved (the DataFrame remains empty), but the type information is lost.
