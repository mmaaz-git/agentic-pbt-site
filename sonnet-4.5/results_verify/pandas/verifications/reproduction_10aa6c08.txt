## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Results

1. **pandas_dtype(None) behavior:**
   - Returns: `float64` (numpy dtype)
   - Does NOT raise any exception
   - This happens because pandas_dtype passes None to np.dtype(None), which returns float64

2. **_get_dtype(None) behavior:**
   - Raises: `TypeError: Cannot deduce dtype from null object`
   - This is the expected behavior as documented in _get_dtype

3. **np.dtype(None) behavior:**
   - Returns: `float64`
   - This is an undocumented NumPy behavior that pandas inherits

4. **Property-based test result:**
   - The test FAILS as reported
   - pandas_dtype(None) returns float64 instead of raising TypeError
   - The assertion failure message correctly identifies the issue

### Additional Context Tests

Testing various inputs showed:
- `None` -> returns `float64` (the reported issue)
- Empty containers ([], {}) -> return their dtype representations
- `False` -> raises TypeError "Cannot interpret 'False' as a data type"
- `0` -> raises TypeError "Cannot interpret '0' as a data type"
- Type objects (int, float) -> correctly convert to dtypes
- String 'float64' -> correctly converts to float64 dtype

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs because:
1. pandas_dtype at line 1663 calls `np.dtype(dtype)` without checking for None first
2. NumPy's np.dtype(None) returns float64 (undocumented behavior)
3. The internal _get_dtype function explicitly checks for None and raises TypeError
4. This creates an inconsistency within pandas' dtype handling

The bug report's technical details are CORRECT. The inconsistency between pandas_dtype and _get_dtype is real and reproducible.
