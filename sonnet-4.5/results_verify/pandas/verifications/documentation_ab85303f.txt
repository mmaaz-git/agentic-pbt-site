DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FUNCTION LOCATION AND STATUS:
   - Function: pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer
   - Located in: pandas.core.indexers.utils (internal module)
   - API Status: INTERNAL/PRIVATE (pandas.core is not public API)
   - Public Documentation: NONE FOUND on pandas.pydata.org

2. FUNCTION DOCSTRING:
   ```
   Return the expected length of target[indexer]

   Returns
   -------
   int
   ```

   The docstring is minimal but clear: it should return the expected length as an integer.

3. SEMANTIC EXPECTATIONS:
   The docstring states "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"

   For a range object used as an indexer:
   - The "expected length" should match len(range_object)
   - Python's range objects have well-defined length semantics
   - range(1, 0, 1) has length 0 by Python specification
   - All range lengths are non-negative integers

4. PYTHON RANGE SPECIFICATION:
   Python's official documentation defines range length as:
   - For positive step: max(0, (stop - start + step - 1) // step)
   - For negative step: max(0, (start - stop - step - 1) // (-step))
   - ALWAYS returns >= 0, never negative

5. UNSPECIFIED BEHAVIOR:
   The docstring does NOT specify:
   - Special handling for empty ranges
   - That negative values are acceptable
   - Any deviation from Python's standard range behavior

6. CONCLUSION:
   Based on the documentation:
   - The function promises to return "the expected length"
   - For range objects, the expected length is unambiguously len(range)
   - Returning negative values violates both the semantic expectation and
     Python's fundamental range behavior
   - The bug is NOT a documentation issue; it's a clear implementation error

The function's behavior contradicts both its documented purpose and Python's
established semantics for range objects. This is not a case of unspecified behavior
or documentation ambiguity.
