BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - The property-based test provided in the bug report runs and fails as expected
   - The test creates a callable object (a class instance with __call__ method)
   - When repr() is called on a Call instance containing this callable, it crashes with:
     AttributeError: 'MyCallable' object has no attribute '__name__'
   - The error occurs at line 46 in Cython/Plex/Actions.py

2. MANUAL TEST REPRODUCTION:
   I tested four different types of callables:

   a) Callable object (class with __call__): FAILS
      - Error: 'CallableObject' object has no attribute '__name__'

   b) functools.partial: FAILS
      - Error: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'

   c) Lambda function: WORKS
      - Output: Call(<lambda>)
      - Works because lambda functions have a __name__ attribute

   d) Regular function: WORKS
      - Output: Call(regular_func)
      - Works because regular functions have a __name__ attribute

3. ROOT CAUSE:
   The Call.__repr__ method at line 46 unconditionally accesses self.function.__name__:

   def __repr__(self):
       return "Call(%s)" % self.function.__name__

   This assumes all callables have a __name__ attribute, which is incorrect.

4. VERIFICATION OF VALID INPUTS:
   I examined Cython/Plex/Lexicons.py and found that at line 158, the code explicitly
   creates Call actions for ANY callable:

   try:
       action_spec.__call__
   except AttributeError:
       action = Actions.Return(action_spec)
   else:
       action = Actions.Call(action_spec)

   This confirms that Call is designed to accept any callable object, not just
   functions with __name__ attributes. The bug report's test cases are valid inputs
   that should be supported.

CONCLUSION: The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The Call class accepts any callable
but its __repr__ method incorrectly assumes all callables have a __name__ attribute.
