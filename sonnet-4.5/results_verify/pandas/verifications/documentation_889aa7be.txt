# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### pandas.DataFrame.sample() Documentation
The official documentation states:
- **weights parameter**: "Infinite values not allowed"
- Weights will be normalized to sum to 1 if they don't already
- Missing values in weights are treated as zero
- Does NOT explicitly mention negative values

### Function Docstring Analysis
The docstring in the preprocess_weights function (lines 24-29) states:
```
Process and validate the `weights` argument to `NDFrame.sample` and `.GroupBy.sample`.
Returns `weights` as an ndarray[np.float64], validated except for normalizing
weights (because that must be done groupwise in groupby sampling).
```

### Error Message Consistency
Looking at the same file, I found two similar error messages:
- Line 67: "weight vector may not include `inf` values" (correct grammar)
- Line 70: "weight vector many not include negative values" (typo: "many" instead of "may")

The consistent pattern shows that both error messages were intended to use "may not".

## Conclusions
1. The documentation doesn't explicitly forbid negative weights, but the code does check for them
2. The error message for negative weights contains a typo
3. The typo is inconsistent with the similar error message for infinite values
4. Based on the parallel structure with the infinite values error (line 67), the intended message is clearly "may not"
5. This is a simple grammatical error in the error message string, not a functional bug
