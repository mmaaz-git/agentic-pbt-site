Bug Triage Analysis for pandas.io.excel._util._excel2num
========================================================

Evaluation for Each Category:
-----------------------------

BUG (Valid Bug Report):
  Why it MIGHT be a BUG:
  - The function explicitly documents it should raise ValueError for invalid input
  - Whitespace and empty strings are NOT valid Excel column names
  - Function returns -1 (invalid column index) instead of raising documented exception
  - Violates the documented contract in the docstring
  - Creates silent failures instead of explicit errors
  - Inconsistent with how it handles other invalid inputs (e.g., 'A B', '123')

  Why it MIGHT NOT be a BUG:
  - None. The behavior clearly violates documented contract.

WONTFIX:
  Why it MIGHT be WONTFIX:
  - Could argue whitespace inputs are obscure edge cases

  Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
  - Not obscure - whitespace/empty strings are common user input errors
  - Silent failure (-1 return) could cause serious bugs downstream
  - The fix is simple and doesn't break existing valid usage
  - Security/safety concern - invalid indices could cause array access issues

INVALID:
  Why it MIGHT be INVALID:
  - None. The bug is clearly reproducible and violates documentation.

  Why it's NOT INVALID:
  - The function behavior doesn't match its documented contract
  - Excel column naming rules are clear - no whitespace allowed
  - The test cases correctly identify invalid inputs

FEATURE_REQUEST:
  Why it MIGHT be FEATURE_REQUEST:
  - None. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new features.

  Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
  - The docstring already promises ValueError for invalid input
  - Not requesting new functionality, just fixing existing contract

DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
  Why it MIGHT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
  - Could change docs to say "returns -1 for empty/whitespace"

  Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
  - Returning -1 for invalid input is bad API design
  - Would be inconsistent with other invalid inputs that raise ValueError
  - -1 is not a valid column index and could cause bugs
  - The documented behavior (raising ValueError) is the correct design

Final Assessment:
----------------
This is clearly a BUG. The function violates its documented contract by returning -1 instead of raising ValueError for whitespace-only and empty string inputs. These are invalid Excel column names and should be handled consistently with other invalid inputs. The proposed fix is correct and necessary.
