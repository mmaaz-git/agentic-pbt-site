# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation
The function `length_of_indexer` in `pandas/core/indexers/utils.py` has the following documentation:

```python
def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
    """
    Return the expected length of target[indexer]

    Returns
    -------
    int
    """
```

## Key Documentation Points

### 1. Function Purpose
The docstring clearly states the function should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]". This is unambiguous - it should return the length that would result from indexing `target` with `indexer`.

### 2. Return Type
The function signature and documentation specify it returns an `int`. While Python integers can be negative, the semantic meaning of "length" is universally understood to be non-negative.

### 3. Semantic Understanding of "Length"
- In mathematics, length is a non-negative measure
- In Python, `len()` always returns non-negative integers
- In NumPy/Pandas, array and series lengths are always non-negative
- The Python documentation for `len()` states it returns "the length (the number of items) of an object"

### 4. Expected Behavior
The documentation says the function returns "the expected length of target[indexer]". This means it should match what `len(target[indexer])` would return. Testing confirms that `len(target[indexer])` always returns non-negative values, even for:
- Empty slices
- Reverse slices
- Out-of-bounds slices

### 5. No Documentation of Negative Returns
There is no documentation indicating that negative values are expected or have special meaning. The documentation does not mention any edge cases where negative values would be returned.

## Conclusion
Based on the documentation, the function should return the same value as `len(target[indexer])`, which is always non-negative. The current behavior of returning negative values violates the documented contract and the fundamental semantic meaning of "length".
