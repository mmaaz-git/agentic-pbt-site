REPRODUCTION REPORT
==================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is confirmed to exist exactly as described.

Test Environment:
- Python 3.13
- Pandas version: 2.3.2
- Location of code: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/clipboards.py

Reproduction Steps:
1. Created and ran a test script that attempts to use non-UTF-8 encodings with both functions
2. Verified the exception types thrown by each function

Results:
- read_clipboard(encoding='latin-1') raises: NotImplementedError
- DataFrame.to_clipboard(encoding='latin-1') raises: ValueError
- This behavior is consistent across all non-UTF-8 encodings tested (latin-1, iso-8859-1, cp1252, utf-16, ascii)

Source Code Verification:
- Line 79 of clipboards.py: `raise NotImplementedError("reading from clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding")`
- Line 161 of clipboards.py: `raise ValueError("clipboard only supports utf-8 encoding")`

The bug report is accurate:
1. Both functions reject non-UTF-8 encodings
2. They raise different exception types for the same validation failure
3. The line numbers in the bug report (79 and 161) are correct
4. The error messages are slightly different but convey the same constraint

Impact:
This inconsistency makes error handling more complex for users who need to catch exceptions from both functions. Users must catch both NotImplementedError and ValueError to handle the same error condition across both functions.
