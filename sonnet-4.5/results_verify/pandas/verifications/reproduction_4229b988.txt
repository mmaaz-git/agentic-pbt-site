## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed as follows:

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test from the bug report was executed and failed as expected. The test caught an `OverflowError` when `ensure_python_int` was called with `float('inf')`, confirming that the function does indeed raise `OverflowError` instead of the documented `TypeError`.

Specific failure:
- Input value: `float('inf')`
- Expected exception: `TypeError`
- Actual exception: `OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer`

### Manual Reproduction Results
The manual test code also confirmed the bug:

1. When calling `ensure_python_int(float('inf'))`:
   - Raised: `OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer`
   - Expected: `TypeError` (according to docstring)

2. When calling `ensure_python_int(float('-inf'))`:
   - Raised: `OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer`
   - Expected: `TypeError` (according to docstring)

### Bug Mechanism
The bug occurs exactly as described in the report:
1. The function accepts float values (infinity passes the initial `is_float(value)` check)
2. The code attempts to convert infinity to int with `int(value)` on line 116
3. Python's built-in `int()` function raises `OverflowError` for infinity values
4. The except clause on line 118 only catches `(TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError)`
5. The `OverflowError` is not caught and propagates to the caller

### Impact
The bug is real and affects the contract specified in the function's documentation. Users expecting a `TypeError` for invalid conversions would receive an unexpected `OverflowError` instead, potentially breaking error handling code that specifically catches `TypeError`.

The reproduction confirms that the bug report accurately describes the issue.
