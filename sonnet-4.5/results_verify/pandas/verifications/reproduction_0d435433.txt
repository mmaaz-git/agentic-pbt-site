## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed in the pandas.util._validators._check_for_default_values function.

### Test Results

1. **TypeError Test**: When an object's __eq__ method raises TypeError, the function crashes with that TypeError instead of falling back to the 'is' operator. This confirms the bug.

2. **AttributeError Test**: Similarly, when __eq__ raises AttributeError, it also propagates instead of being caught. This further confirms the bug affects all non-ValueError exceptions.

3. **ValueError Test**: The current code DOES correctly catch ValueError and falls back to 'is' comparison, confirming the existing behavior works for this specific exception type.

### Code Analysis

Looking at lines 61-78 of _validators.py, the try-except block is:

```python
try:
    v1 = arg_val_dict[key]
    v2 = compat_args[key]

    if (v1 is not None and v2 is None) or (v1 is None and v2 is not None):
        match = False
    else:
        match = v1 == v2  # Line 70 - can raise various exceptions

    if not is_bool(match):
        raise ValueError("'match' is not a boolean")

except ValueError:  # Line 77 - ONLY catches ValueError
    match = arg_val_dict[key] is compat_args[key]
```

The problem is clear: The comparison `v1 == v2` on line 70 can raise ANY exception type (TypeError, AttributeError, etc.), but the except clause on line 77 only catches ValueError.

### Impact

This bug causes the function to crash when processing objects with custom __eq__ methods that raise non-ValueError exceptions. Since the code has an explicit fallback mechanism using 'is' comparison (lines 77-78), the clear intent is to handle comparison failures gracefully. The bug prevents this fallback from working for all exception types except ValueError.

The bug report's proposed fix to change `except ValueError:` to `except Exception:` would correctly address this issue by catching all exceptions during comparison and falling back to identity comparison.
