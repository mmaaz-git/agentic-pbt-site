TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The function explicitly promises to return a boolean but raises an exception instead
- The function name "is_re_compilable" follows Python's predicate convention (is_*, has_*, can_*) which should return True/False
- The docstring clearly states "Returns: bool" with no mention of raising exceptions
- The function already handles TypeError for non-string inputs by returning False
- Users would reasonably expect to use this function to safely check if a string is a valid regex without exception handling
- The proposed fix is simple and maintains backward compatibility for all valid use cases

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

## INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- It's not invalid - the bug report correctly identifies a real issue where the implementation doesn't match the documented behavior

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The documentation clearly promises a boolean return value
- The function violates its API contract by raising exceptions

## WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Could argue that users should validate their regex patterns before calling this function
- The error provides more detailed information about why the regex is invalid

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - invalid regex patterns are common in user input
- The entire purpose of the function is to check if something can be compiled as regex
- The function name and documentation create a clear expectation of safe checking

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could update docs to say "Raises: re.PatternError for invalid regex syntax"

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The function's purpose and name strongly imply it should be a safe predicate
- Changing docs would break the expected behavior for a function named "is_re_compilable"
- The fix to make code match docs is simpler than changing docs to match broken code

## FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue the current behavior is "as designed" and safe checking is a new feature

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The documentation already describes the intended behavior (returning bool)
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality

## FINAL ASSESSMENT
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function violates its documented API contract by raising exceptions instead of returning False for invalid regex patterns. The function name, documentation, and existing TypeError handling all indicate the intended behavior is to return a boolean for all inputs.
