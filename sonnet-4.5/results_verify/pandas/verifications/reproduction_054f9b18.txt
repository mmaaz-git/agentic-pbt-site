REPRODUCTION REPORT FOR pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix

1. BUG REPRODUCTION

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. The bug report is accurate in its description.

1.1 Property-based test execution:
The property-based test runs and finds two distinct failure modes:
a) ValueError when axis limits cannot be set to NaN or Inf (when DataFrame contains inf values)
b) ValueError: "Too many bins for data range. Cannot create 10 finite-sized bins" - occurs with single-row DataFrames containing large numeric values

1.2 Specific failing example:
The exact example from the bug report was reproduced:
- DataFrame: {'A': [0.0], 'B': [-1.297501e+16], 'C': [-1.297501e+16]}
- Result: ValueError: Too many bins for data range. Cannot create 10 finite-sized bins.

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The failure occurs in matplotlib's histogram function (called at line 81 of pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/misc.py) when:
- The DataFrame has a single row (or multiple rows with identical values)
- The values are large in magnitude (approximately >= 1e15)

The issue arises because:
- When all values are identical, the data range is 0
- For large values, floating-point precision issues prevent matplotlib from creating finite-sized bins
- The threshold appears to be around 1e14 to 1e15

3. BEHAVIOR OBSERVATIONS

Testing revealed:
- Single-row DataFrames with small values (e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0) work but generate warnings
- Single-row DataFrames with values of 0 work
- Single-row DataFrames with large values (>= 1e15) fail with ValueError
- Multiple-row DataFrames with identical large values also fail
- The failure occurs in both positive and negative large values

4. SCOPE OF ISSUE

This affects:
- Single-row DataFrames with large numeric values
- Multi-row DataFrames where all values in a column are identical and large
- The issue is not specific to pandas but is a limitation of matplotlib's histogram implementation

The bug report correctly identifies the issue and provides an accurate reproduction case.
