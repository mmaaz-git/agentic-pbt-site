## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The error message is objectively incorrect - it shows "methodtype must be one of invalid" which is nonsensical
- The variables in the f-string are clearly swapped (line 298 in the source)
- This is a simple typo/mistake in the error message formatting
- The fix is trivial and obvious - swap the two variables in the f-string
- Error messages should be clear and helpful, not confusing
- This affects user experience when debugging their code

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- No strong arguments against this being a bug

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The validation itself is not documented, so technically the error message format is not specified
- Could argue that methodtype validation is an internal implementation detail

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- Even if undocumented, error messages should make logical sense
- "methodtype must be one of invalid" is objectively incorrect regardless of documentation
- The code clearly shows the variables are swapped - this is not intentional behavior

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The error only occurs when users provide invalid methodtype values
- Users shouldn't be passing invalid values in the first place
- This is a validation error for incorrect usage

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Even validation errors should have correct messages
- Users will encounter this when making mistakes, and clear error messages help them fix issues
- The fix is trivial (swap two variables)
- This is not an obscure edge case - any invalid methodtype triggers this

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that better error messages are a feature enhancement

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The error message exists but is wrong - fixing it is a bug fix, not a feature

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The valid methodtype values are not documented
- Could add documentation about the validation behavior

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The issue is with the code implementation, not the documentation
- The error message in the code is objectively wrong
- Adding documentation wouldn't fix the confusing error message

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The error message has swapped parameters, producing nonsensical output like "methodtype must be one of invalid" when it should say "methodtype must be one of {'method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', 'property'}, got invalid instead."

The fix is trivial and correct - swap the two variables in the f-string on line 298. This is a straightforward bug in the error message formatting that negatively impacts user experience when they make mistakes with the methodtype parameter.
