## Documentation Analysis for FixedForwardWindowIndexer

### Official Documentation
The pandas documentation for `FixedForwardWindowIndexer` states that it "Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row." The class is designed to create forward-looking windows for rolling calculations.

### Parameters
- `window_size`: Default value is 0. Represents the size of the moving window - the number of observations used for calculating statistics.
- The documentation provides examples using positive values (e.g., window_size=2).

### Constraints on window_size
**Critical Finding**: The documentation does NOT specify any constraints or validation requirements for the window_size parameter. Specifically:
- No mention of what happens with negative values
- No explicit statement that window_size must be non-negative
- No error handling documented for invalid window_size values

### Source Code Analysis
From examining the source code of `get_window_bounds`:
1. The implementation uses `start + self.window_size` to calculate end boundaries
2. When window_size is non-zero, it clips the end values: `end = np.clip(end, 0, num_values)`
3. No validation is performed on window_size being negative in either __init__ or get_window_bounds

### Semantic Expectations
While not explicitly documented, the semantic meaning of "window size" as "the number of observations" strongly implies it should be non-negative. You cannot have a negative number of observations in a window.

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation fails to:
1. Explicitly state that window_size must be non-negative
2. Specify what behavior to expect if negative values are provided
3. Document any ValueError or other exceptions that should be raised for invalid inputs

This is a documentation gap where the constraints on the parameter are not clearly specified, leaving the behavior undefined for negative values.
