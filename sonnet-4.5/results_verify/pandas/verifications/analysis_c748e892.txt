BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS: pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer
=============================================================

EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL CATEGORIES:
------------------------------------

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
   STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Function returns negative lengths, which is mathematically impossible
   - Docstring explicitly states "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
   - Property-based testing shows systematic failures
   - Function behavior doesn't match actual Python slicing behavior
   - Multiple reproducible test cases with clear incorrect outputs
   - The errors occur with valid Python slice/range inputs

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - Function is in pandas.core (private module) - but still used internally
   - No public API documentation - but has a clear docstring contract

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None - the bugs are clearly reproducible

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - All test cases reproduce exactly as described
   - The function clearly returns negative values
   - Property-based testing confirms systematic failures

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Function is internal/private to pandas
   - Edge cases might be considered obscure

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - Returning negative lengths is a fundamental logic error
   - This function is used internally by pandas for indexing operations
   - Incorrect length calculations could cascade to other pandas operations
   - The bugs affect valid Python slice patterns

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None - the function claims to calculate lengths

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The docstring explicitly states the function should return expected length
   - This is core functionality that's broken, not a new feature

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Function has minimal documentation

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The docstring is correct - it should return the expected length
   - The implementation is wrong, not the documentation
   - Returning negative lengths violates the stated purpose

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
------------------

Core Issue: The function violates its fundamental contract by returning negative values when calculating lengths. A "length" is by definition non-negative.

Severity Assessment:
- High severity: Returns mathematically invalid results (negative lengths)
- Affects internal pandas operations that rely on accurate length calculations
- Could cause downstream errors in pandas indexing operations
- Violates the principle of least surprise

Code Quality Issues Found:
1. Line 316: Uses integer division that can go negative
2. Line 326: Incorrect formula for range length calculation
3. Lines 303-315: Improper handling of negative step slices
4. No bounds checking to ensure non-negative results

Why This Is Not Edge Case/Obscure:
- Negative step slices are common in Python (e.g., reversing sequences)
- Out-of-bounds indexing is handled gracefully by Python
- These are standard Python slice patterns, not obscure edge cases

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
-----------------
This is a VALID BUG that should be fixed. The function has multiple logic errors causing it to return invalid (negative) lengths for various standard Python slice patterns. The bugs violate:

1. Mathematical definition of "length" (must be non-negative)
2. The function's documented contract ("expected length of target[indexer]")
3. Python's standard slicing behavior
4. Basic expectations for a length calculation function

The fact that it's an internal function doesn't excuse returning mathematically invalid results. Internal functions still need to be correct, especially when they're part of core indexing operations.
