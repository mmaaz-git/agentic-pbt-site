## Documentation Analysis

### Official pandas Documentation
I examined the pandas documentation for `FixedWindowIndexer` and related classes. Key findings:

1. **BaseIndexer Documentation**: The BaseIndexer class documentation provides a base class for window bounds calculations. It shows that `get_window_bounds` should return a tuple of ndarray[int64]s indicating the boundaries of each window.

2. **Window Bounds Semantics**: The documentation indicates that window bounds represent intervals used for slicing operations. The examples in BaseIndexer show `start[i]` and `end[i]` being used to define window boundaries where `end[i] = start[i] + window_size`.

3. **Window Size Parameter**: The pandas rolling documentation states that window must be "an integer 0 or greater" according to error messages in the codebase. This explicitly allows `window_size=0` as a valid input.

4. **No Explicit Invariant Documentation**: The documentation does not explicitly state that `start[i] <= end[i]` must hold. However, this is an implicit requirement based on:
   - Python's slicing semantics where `arr[a:b]` expects `a <= b` for non-empty results
   - The window bounds are used directly for array slicing in rolling operations
   - All examples in the documentation maintain this invariant

5. **Closed Parameter**: The documentation explains that the `closed` parameter determines which endpoints are included in the window:
   - `'neither'`: Neither endpoint is included
   - `'left'`: Only the left endpoint is included
   - `'right'`: Only the right endpoint is included
   - `'both'`: Both endpoints are included
   - `None`: Default behavior (typically 'both' for fixed windows)

### Semantic Expectations

6. **Window Size 0 Meaning**: While not explicitly documented, a window of size 0 should logically represent an empty window that selects 0 elements. The current implementation mostly achieves this (producing empty slices), but violates the fundamental slicing invariant in the process.

7. **Comparison with Other Indexers**:
   - `FixedForwardWindowIndexer(window_size=0)` maintains the invariant correctly
   - `ExpandingIndexer` always maintains `start <= end`
   - Only `FixedWindowIndexer` violates the invariant in this specific case

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not explicitly define:
- The expected behavior for `window_size=0`
- The invariant that `start[i] <= end[i]` must hold
- How edge cases with zero-sized windows should interact with the `closed` parameter

However, these requirements can be reasonably inferred from the context of how window bounds are used in practice (array slicing) and from the behavior of similar classes in the pandas ecosystem.
