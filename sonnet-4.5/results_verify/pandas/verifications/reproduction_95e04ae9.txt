BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT

## Test Execution Results

### Original Bug Report Test Case
I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report:

Input: DataFrame with column name '\x08' (backspace character)
Output after round-trip:
- Original column: '\x08'
- After round-trip: '_x0008_'
- Result: Columns are NOT equal

### Hypothesis Test
The property-based test with failing input col_names=['\x08'] correctly fails with an assertion error, confirming that the round-trip property is violated.

### Comprehensive Control Character Testing

I tested various control characters with both engines:

**xlsxwriter Engine Results:**
- '\x00' (null) → '_x0000_' [CHANGED]
- '\x01' (start of heading) → '_x0001_' [CHANGED]
- '\x02' (start of text) → '_x0002_' [CHANGED]
- '\x07' (bell) → '_x0007_' [CHANGED]
- '\x08' (backspace) → '_x0008_' [CHANGED]
- '\x0b' (vertical tab) → '_x000B_' [CHANGED]
- '\x0c' (form feed) → '_x000C_' [CHANGED]
- '\x0e' (shift out) → '_x000E_' [CHANGED]
- '\x0f' (shift in) → '_x000F_' [CHANGED]
- '\x10' (data link escape) → '_x0010_' [CHANGED]
- '\x1f' (unit separator) → '_x001F_' [CHANGED]
- '\t' (tab) → '\t' [PRESERVED]
- '\n' (newline) → '\n' [PRESERVED]
- '\r' (carriage return) → '_x000D_' [CHANGED]

**openpyxl Engine Results:**
- All control characters except tab, newline, and carriage return raise an error:
  "cannot be used in worksheets"
- Tab, newline, and carriage return are preserved correctly

## Technical Analysis

1. **The bug is real**: Control characters in column names are silently transformed during Excel round-trip operations.

2. **The transformation follows OOXML specification**: The _xHHHH_ escape format is the standard OOXML mechanism for representing XML-invalid characters.

3. **Engine behavior differs**:
   - xlsxwriter: Silently escapes invalid characters
   - openpyxl: Raises an error and refuses to write

4. **The transformation is one-way**: pandas does not reverse the escaping when reading the Excel file back.

5. **Impact**: Any code that relies on specific column names will break after a round-trip if those names contain control characters.

## Verification of Bug Report Claims

✓ Column names with control characters ARE transformed (confirmed)
✓ The transformation uses _xHHHH_ format (confirmed)
✓ The transformation is silent with xlsxwriter (confirmed)
✓ Different engines handle it differently (confirmed)
✓ The round-trip property is violated (confirmed)
✓ This behavior is undocumented in pandas (confirmed)

The bug report is technically accurate in all its claims.
