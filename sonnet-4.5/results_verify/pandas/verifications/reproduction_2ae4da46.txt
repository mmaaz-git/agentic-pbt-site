## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the pandas.io.json ujson precision loss issue.

### Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis test fails exactly as described, with the failing input being `obj=1.0000000000000002e+16`. The test confirms that the round-trip property `ujson_loads(ujson_dumps(x)) == x` is violated for this specific float value.

### Manual Reproduction
Running the provided reproduction code confirms:

1. Original value: `1.0000000000000002e+16`
2. ujson_dumps produces: `"1e+16"` (loses precision)
3. ujson_loads recovers: `1e+16`
4. Precision is lost: The difference is 2.0
5. The stdlib json module correctly preserves the precision, serializing as `"1.0000000000000002e+16"` and recovering the exact value

### Observed Behavior
The ujson library is indeed losing precision when serializing large float values. Specifically:
- The float `1.0000000000000002e+16` is being rounded to `1e+16` during serialization
- This results in a loss of 2.0 in the value
- The round-trip property is violated: the deserialized value does not equal the original value

This is in contrast to the standard library json module, which correctly preserves the full precision of the float during serialization and deserialization.

The bug report is accurate in its description of the problem.
