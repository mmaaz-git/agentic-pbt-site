## Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.util.hashing.hash_array

### Public API Documentation (pandas website)
The official pandas documentation for hash_array() provides the following information:
- Parameters include hash_key as a string parameter with default value '0123456789123456'
- The documentation describes hash_key as "Hash_key for string key to encode"
- No explicit requirement is mentioned that the hash_key must be exactly 16 bytes when encoded
- No mention of character vs byte length distinction
- The default value is a 16-character ASCII string that happens to be 16 bytes

### Source Code Documentation (docstring)
The hash_array function docstring states:
- "hash_key : str, default _default_hash_key
   Hash_key for string key to encode."
- No explicit byte-length requirement is documented
- The comment above _default_hash_key says "# 16 byte long hashing key" but this is not in the public docstring

### Internal C Function Documentation
The underlying hash_object_array C function documentation (accessible via help()) clearly states:
- "key : hash key, must be 16 byte len encoded"
- This is an explicit requirement that the key must encode to exactly 16 bytes

### Key Findings
1. There is a clear disconnect between the public Python API documentation and the internal C implementation requirements
2. The public documentation does not inform users that the hash_key must encode to exactly 16 bytes
3. The Python interface accepts any string but does not validate that it meets the byte-length requirement
4. The default key is 16 ASCII characters which happens to be 16 bytes, potentially misleading users to think any 16-character string would work
5. The C function has a strict requirement (16 bytes encoded) that is not enforced or documented at the Python level
