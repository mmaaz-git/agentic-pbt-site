## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### Test Results:

1. **Simple Reproduction Test**:
   - When registering two ExtensionDtype classes with the same name ('duplicatename'), only the first one is retrievable
   - `pd.api.types.pandas_dtype('duplicatename')` returns FirstDtype, not SecondDtype
   - The second registration silently fails without any warning or error

2. **Hypothesis Test Case**:
   - The test fails as expected with dtype_name='a'
   - The assertion `isinstance(dtype, TestDtype2)` fails because the retrieved dtype is TestDtype1
   - This confirms that the second registration does not override the first

### Effect of the Bug:

The bug has the following effects:
1. **Silent Failure**: Users who register multiple extension dtypes with the same name will not receive any warning that their second (or subsequent) registration is ineffective
2. **Inability to Override**: There's no way to programmatically update or replace an existing dtype registration
3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: This differs from similar functionality like `register_series_accessor` which does warn and override

The bug is real and behaves exactly as described in the report. The registry appends the new dtype but the find method always returns the first match, making subsequent registrations with the same name useless.
