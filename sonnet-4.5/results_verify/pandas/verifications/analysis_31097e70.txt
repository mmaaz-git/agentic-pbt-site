## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible - negative window sizes do produce invalid bounds
- The invariant violation (start > end) is a fundamental correctness issue
- The behavior is inconsistent with pandas.rolling() which validates window >= 0
- "Fixed-length windows" semantically implies non-negative lengths

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly forbid negative window sizes
- No explicit contract stating window_size must be >= 0

**Conclusion:** NOT INVALID - The bug violates fundamental mathematical invariants even if not explicitly documented

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Could argue negative window sizes are an obscure edge case
- Users unlikely to intentionally use negative window sizes in practice
- The class still "works" in that it returns arrays of the correct shape

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure numerical edge case but a clear logic error
- Silent wrong results are worse than errors - could lead to incorrect analysis
- The fix is trivial (single validation check)
- Consistency with pandas.rolling() is important for user experience

**Conclusion:** NOT WONTFIX - Silent incorrect results are serious enough to warrant fixing

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Adding validation could be seen as a new feature
- The current code "works" according to its implementation
- Documentation doesn't promise validation

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- Window bounds invariant (start <= end) is fundamental, not a feature
- Validation is a bug fix to prevent invalid states, not an enhancement

**Conclusion:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing a correctness bug, not adding features

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Documentation could be clearer about window_size constraints
- Could document that negative values produce undefined behavior

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not just the documentation
- Documenting "negative values give invalid results" would be poor API design
- The fix should be in the code, not just documentation
- Other pandas functions validate this constraint in code

**Conclusion:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code needs fixing, not just documentation

### Considering BUG
**Strong arguments for BUG:**
1. **Invariant Violation**: The fundamental invariant start[i] <= end[i] is violated
2. **Silent Incorrect Results**: Returns invalid window bounds without error
3. **Inconsistent with pandas.rolling()**: Standard rolling validates window >= 0
4. **Semantic Violation**: "Fixed-length windows" with negative length is nonsensical
5. **Simple Fix Available**: Adding validation is straightforward
6. **User Impact**: Could cause incorrect data analysis if undetected
7. **Not Edge Case**: Any negative window_size triggers the issue

**No strong arguments against BUG**

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The FixedForwardWindowIndexer should validate that window_size >= 0 to:
1. Maintain the fundamental window bounds invariant
2. Ensure consistency with pandas.rolling() behavior
3. Prevent silent incorrect results
4. Match the semantic meaning of "fixed-length windows"

The suggested fix (adding validation to reject negative window sizes) is appropriate and aligns with established pandas patterns.
