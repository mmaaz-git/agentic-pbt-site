## Documentation Analysis for convert_to_line_delimits

### Official Documentation
**NOT FOUND** - The `convert_to_line_delimits` function is not documented in the public pandas API documentation. It appears to be an internal helper function in the `pandas.io.json._normalize` module.

### Function Source Documentation
From the source code at `/pandas/io/json/_normalize.py`:
```python
def convert_to_line_delimits(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Helper function that converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON.
    """
```

The docstring is minimal and only states it "converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON."

### Code Comments
The function has one comment:
```python
# Determine we have a JSON list to turn to lines otherwise just return the
# json object, only lists can
```

This comment indicates the function's intent:
1. Check if the input is a JSON list (starts with '[' and ends with ']')
2. If it's a JSON list, convert it to line-delimited format
3. If it's not a JSON list, return unchanged

### Usage Context
The function is used in `pandas/io/json/_json.py`:
- Called when the `lines=True` parameter is used in JSON writing operations
- Takes a JSON string and converts it to line-delimited format if it's a list

### Related Function Documentation
`convert_json_to_lines` (from pandas._libs.writers):
- Documentation: "replace comma separated json with line feeds, paying special attention to quotes & brackets"
- This is a Cython function that does the actual conversion
- It processes the content between brackets, converting commas to newlines

### Expected Behavior (Inferred from Context)
Based on the code structure and usage:
1. **Input**: A JSON string that may or may not be a JSON array
2. **Output**:
   - If input is a JSON array (starts with '[' and ends with ']'): line-delimited JSON
   - Otherwise: unchanged input string
3. **Purpose**: Support for line-delimited JSON format (also known as JSONL or NDJSON)

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
**UNDOCUMENTED** - The function does not document:
- What happens with empty strings
- What happens with malformed JSON
- What happens with partial brackets (e.g., '[incomplete' or 'data]')
- Whether it validates JSON syntax
- What exceptions it may raise

### Specification Gaps
1. **No input validation specification** - The function doesn't specify if it checks for empty or null inputs
2. **No error handling documentation** - No mention of what exceptions might be raised
3. **No format specification** - Doesn't specify what constitutes a "JSON list" beyond bracket checking
4. **No edge case documentation** - Doesn't specify behavior for malformed inputs

### Conclusion
The function lacks comprehensive documentation about its expected behavior, particularly regarding:
- Empty string handling
- Malformed JSON handling
- Error conditions
- Input validation requirements

The current implementation's crash on empty strings and incorrect logic for partial bracket patterns represents undefined behavior that is not explicitly documented. The function appears to be an internal utility with minimal public-facing documentation.
