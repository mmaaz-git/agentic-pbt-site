## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.core.array_algos.putmask.putmask_without_repeat.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The provided hypothesis test fails as expected. When values_size=10 and new_size=1, the function does NOT raise a ValueError as the test expects. Instead, it silently repeats the single value.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: Running the exact example from the bug report confirms the behavior:
   - Input: values=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], mask=all True, new=[999]
   - Output: [999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999]
   - Expected: ValueError("cannot assign mismatch length to masked array")
   - Actual: No error raised, value 999 is repeated across all 10 positions

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug occurs at line 93 of putmask.py:
```python
elif mask.shape[-1] == shape[-1] or shape[-1] == 1:
    np.putmask(values, mask, new)
```

The condition `shape[-1] == 1` creates a special case that allows single-element arrays to be passed to np.putmask, which by design will repeat that single value across all masked positions. This directly contradicts the function's documented purpose.

### What Actually Happens

When new has shape (1,) and mask has 10 True values:
- nlocs = 10 (number of positions to fill)
- shape[-1] = 1 (length of new array)
- The condition `shape[-1] == 1` evaluates to True
- np.putmask is called, which repeats the single value 10 times

The function should have raised a ValueError because nlocs (10) != len(new) (1), enforcing the "exact match" requirement stated in the documentation.
