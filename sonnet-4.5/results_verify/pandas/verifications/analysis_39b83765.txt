## Bug Triage Analysis

### BUG (Most Likely)
**Why this is a BUG:**
1. The class documentation clearly states it "allows for parameter aliasing"
2. Other dict methods (`__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__contains__`, `__delitem__`) all handle aliases correctly
3. The `use()` method documentation explicitly says "Aliasing allowed"
4. This creates an inconsistent API where `opts["x_compat"]` works but `opts.get("x_compat")` doesn't
5. It violates the principle of least surprise - users expect dict-like objects to have consistent behavior across all dict operations
6. The example in the docstring shows using aliases, setting the expectation that they work throughout
7. There's no documentation saying `get()` is an exception to the aliasing rule

### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue that `get()` is inherited from dict and not explicitly documented to support aliases
- However, this is weak because the class doc says aliasing is allowed without exceptions

### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- This is an internal class (starts with underscore) used primarily internally
- The impact might be considered minimal if most code uses `__getitem__` instead of `get()`
- However, it's exposed via `plot_params` public variable, so it's semi-public

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could update docs to say "aliasing works for all operations except get()"
- However, this would be acknowledging a design flaw rather than fixing it
- The current documentation implies aliasing should work everywhere

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that full `get()` support with aliases is a new feature
- However, this contradicts the documented behavior that aliasing is already supported

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The class promises parameter aliasing but fails to deliver it consistently across all dict operations. The inconsistency between `__getitem__` and `get()` is particularly problematic because:
1. They serve the same purpose (retrieving values)
2. In standard dict usage, `d.get(k)` and `d[k]` should behave identically (except for missing keys)
3. Users will reasonably expect that if `opts["x_compat"]` works, then `opts.get("x_compat")` should also work

The fix is straightforward and maintains backward compatibility - override `get()` to apply alias translation just like the other methods do.
