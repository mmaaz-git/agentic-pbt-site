=== BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT ===

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs when round-tripping DataFrames containing uint64 values that exceed the int64 maximum value (2^63 - 1) through the 'table' orient JSON format.

## Reproduction Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test correctly identified the failure with two distinct issues:
   - Values below int64 minimum (-9223372036854775809) cause a ValueError: "Value is too small"
   - Values at exactly 2^63 (9223372036854775808) silently overflow to negative values

2. **Manual Reproduction**: Confirmed the exact scenario from the bug report:
   - Original value: 9223372036854775808 (uint64)
   - After round-trip: -9223372036854775808 (int64)
   - Data corruption confirmed: The value changes sign without warning

3. **Schema Analysis**:
   - All integer types (int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64) are mapped to generic "integer" in the table schema
   - The JSON correctly serializes the uint64 value as 9223372036854775808
   - Upon reading back, pandas interprets all integers as int64, causing overflow for uint64 values > 2^63-1

4. **Comparison with Other Orients**:
   - 'split', 'records', 'index', 'columns', and 'values' orients ALL handle the uint64 value correctly
   - Only 'table' orient exhibits the overflow issue

## Technical Details:

The bug occurs because:
1. The table schema maps both signed and unsigned integers to a generic "integer" type
2. When reading JSON with table orient, pandas defaults to int64 for all integer values
3. The value 9223372036854775808 is valid in JSON and correctly serialized
4. But when parsed back as int64, it overflows to -9223372036854775808

The issue is particularly serious because:
- It causes **silent data corruption** with no warnings or errors
- The corrupted values have opposite signs, making the error catastrophic for numerical computations
- It only affects the 'table' orient, creating inconsistent behavior across pandas JSON operations
