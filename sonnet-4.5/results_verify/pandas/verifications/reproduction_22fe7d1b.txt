BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed with pandas.tseries.frequencies functions is_subperiod() and is_superperiod().

Test Results:
------------

1. Hypothesis Test:
   - The property-based test failed exactly as described
   - Failing input: source='D', target='B'
   - is_subperiod('D', 'B') returns False
   - is_superperiod('B', 'D') returns True
   - These should be equal due to the inverse relationship, but they are not

2. Specific Test Cases:

   Inverse Relationship Test:
   - is_subperiod('D', 'B') = False
   - is_superperiod('B', 'D') = True
   - Expected: These should be equal (both True or both False)
   - Result: FAILED - They are not equal

   Both Superperiods Test:
   - is_superperiod('D', 'B') = True
   - is_superperiod('B', 'D') = True
   - Expected: At most one should be True (two frequencies cannot both be superperiods of each other)
   - Result: FAILED - Both return True, which is logically impossible

   Additional Observations:
   - is_subperiod('B', 'D') = False
   - is_subperiod('D', 'B') = False
   - Both subperiod checks return False, while both superperiod checks return True

Conclusion:
----------
The bug is confirmed. There are two clear issues:

1. The inverse relationship between is_subperiod and is_superperiod is violated for 'D' and 'B' frequencies
2. Both is_superperiod('D', 'B') and is_superperiod('B', 'D') return True, which is logically impossible

The functions are returning inconsistent results that violate basic mathematical relationships between period frequencies.
