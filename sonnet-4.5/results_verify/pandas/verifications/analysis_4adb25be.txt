## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The implementation clearly intends to protect default keys, as evidenced by the `__delitem__` override that raises ValueError
- The error message "Cannot remove default parameter" explicitly states the protection intent
- There is an obvious inconsistency: `del opts["key"]` raises an error while `opts.pop("key")` succeeds
- The class maintains a `_DEFAULT_KEYS` constant specifically to track protected keys
- This is a contract violation where the class invariant (default keys cannot be removed) is not consistently enforced
- The bug affects not just `pop()` but also `popitem()` and `clear()` methods

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The class is marked as private (starts with underscore) and may not be intended for direct use
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state that default keys must be protected

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The _Options class is private (underscore prefix) and might not be part of the public API
- Users should potentially only interact through `plot_params` instance
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that default keys cannot be removed

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The implementation clearly shows intent to protect default keys
- The `__delitem__` method explicitly checks and raises an error
- Even private classes should have consistent behavior
- The class is used through the public `plot_params` object

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- This might be considered an edge case that rarely occurs in practice
- Users typically wouldn't try to remove default plotting parameters
- The class is private and internal

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - `pop()` is a common dict operation
- The inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior and bugs
- The fix is straightforward and improves code consistency

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be updated to clarify that default keys should not be removed
- Could document that only `del` is protected, not other removal methods

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is clearly incorrect and inconsistent
- Documenting a bug doesn't make it correct behavior
- The implementation intent is clear from the `__delitem__` override

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as requesting new protection for additional methods

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing an inconsistency, not adding new functionality
- The protection already exists for `__delitem__`, it just needs to be extended
- This is a bug fix to make the class behave consistently

### Additional Findings:

During investigation, I discovered that the issue is broader than reported:
- `pop()` bypasses protection (as reported)
- `popitem()` also bypasses protection (not mentioned in report)
- `clear()` also bypasses protection (not mentioned in report)

This strengthens the case that this is a valid bug - multiple methods violate the class invariant.

### Conclusion:

This is a **BUG** - a valid bug report that should be filed. The reasons are:

1. **Clear implementation intent**: The `__delitem__` override and `_DEFAULT_KEYS` constant show clear intent to protect default keys
2. **Inconsistent behavior**: Some removal methods protect default keys while others don't
3. **Contract violation**: The class has an implicit invariant that default keys cannot be removed, which is not consistently enforced
4. **Simple fix**: The solution is straightforward - override the additional methods to apply the same protection
5. **Broader impact**: The bug affects multiple methods (pop, popitem, clear), not just pop

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, includes a working reproduction, and proposes a reasonable fix. This should be tagged as a valid BUG.
