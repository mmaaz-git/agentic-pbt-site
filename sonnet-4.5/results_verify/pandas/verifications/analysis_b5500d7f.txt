## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible: length_of_indexer(range(0,1,2)) returns 0 when it should return 1
- The function's docstring clearly states it should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Python's built-in len(range(0,1,2)) returns 1, which is the expected behavior
- The implementation is mathematically incorrect for ranges where step doesn't evenly divide the span

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- None. The bug is clearly valid and violates the documented behavior.

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Could argue this is an obscure edge case that rarely occurs in practice
- The function is internal (not public API), so impact might be limited

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - any range with a remainder will fail
- Even internal functions should work correctly as they affect pandas operations
- The fix is trivial: just use len(indexer) instead of the incorrect formula
- This could cause silent data corruption or index errors in production code

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could argue the documentation should specify the formula being used

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation is correct - it says return the expected length
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Changing docs to match broken code would be backwards

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- None. The function already exists and has clear expected behavior.

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The function already handles range objects, just incorrectly

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The function returns mathematically incorrect results for range objects
- The bug is reproducible and affects all ranges where step doesn't evenly divide the span
- The current implementation violates the function's documented purpose
- The fix is straightforward: use Python's built-in len() for range objects
- This could cause real issues in pandas indexing operations
- The bug report provides clear reproduction steps and a valid fix

**Arguments against BUG:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

### Conclusion
This is a valid BUG. The function fails to correctly calculate the length of range objects, returning incorrect values that violate both the documented behavior and mathematical correctness. The bug is not trivial as it could affect any pandas operation that uses range-based indexing internally.
