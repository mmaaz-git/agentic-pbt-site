## Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.window.common.zsqrt

The `zsqrt` function is an **internal, undocumented** function in the pandas library located in `/pandas/core/window/common.py`.

**Key findings from documentation search:**
1. There is NO public documentation for this function on pandas.pydata.org
2. The function has NO docstring in the source code
3. It is not listed in any public API reference documentation
4. Web searches for "pandas zsqrt" return no official documentation

**Function location and usage:**
- The function is defined in `pandas/core/window/common.py` (lines 149-161)
- It is imported and used internally by `pandas/core/window/ewm.py` in two places:
  - Line 675: Used in the `.std()` method to compute standard deviation as `zsqrt(self.var(...))`
  - Line 892: Used in correlation calculation as `cov / zsqrt(x_var * y_var)`

**Function purpose (inferred from code):**
The function appears to be a "safe" square root that:
1. Computes the square root of input values using numpy.sqrt
2. Sets any results from negative inputs to 0 (instead of NaN)
3. The "z" prefix likely stands for "zero" (return zero for negative inputs)

**Input expectations (inferred from code):**
- The code explicitly checks for `ABCDataFrame` type (lines 154-156)
- For non-DataFrame inputs, it assumes the input has a `.any()` method (line 158)
- There are NO type hints specifying expected input types
- There is NO documentation stating what types of inputs are valid

**Internal vs Public API:**
This appears to be an internal utility function because:
1. It has no documentation
2. It's not exposed in any public API
3. It's only used internally within the window operations module
4. The name doesn't follow pandas' public API naming conventions

Since this is an undocumented internal function with no specified contract about what inputs it should accept, the behavior on scalar inputs is technically unspecified.
