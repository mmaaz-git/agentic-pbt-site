REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

The bug has been successfully reproduced. The reported issue is accurate in both its description and its impact.

## Confirmed Issues:

1. **Uniqueness Violation**: The function violates its documented guarantee about preserving uniqueness.
   - Input: [0.0, 2.225073858507203e-309] (two different values)
   - Output: ['0%', '0%'] (both formatted identically)
   - This directly violates the docstring promise that different percentiles remain different after formatting

2. **Invalid Output Strings**: The function produces completely invalid percentage representations.
   - 'inf%' strings: When given valid percentiles like [0.9374708737308688, 0.5, ...], outputs include 'inf%'
   - 'nan%' strings: When given valid percentiles like [5e-324, ...], all outputs become 'nan%'
   - These are not valid percentage representations and would break downstream code expecting valid percentage strings

3. **Runtime Warnings**: The function generates multiple warnings during execution:
   - "overflow encountered in multiply"
   - "invalid value encountered in divide"
   - "invalid value encountered in cast"
   - These warnings indicate numerical instability in the current implementation

## Root Cause:

The bug occurs because the get_precision function computes precision as -floor(log10(min_diff)). When percentiles have very small differences (e.g., 2.225e-309), this calculation yields extremely large precision values (around 307). When these large precision values are passed to numpy's round() function, it causes numerical overflow, resulting in inf or nan values.

## Impact:

This is a valid bug that affects the correctness and reliability of the format_percentiles function when dealing with very small but valid percentile values in the range [0, 1]. The function should handle all valid inputs gracefully without producing invalid output.
