BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

TEST CASE FROM BUG REPORT:
Input: ['0.00', '0.0000', '0.00000']
Output: ['0.0', '0.00', '0.000']
Decimal lengths: [1, 2, 3]

The bug report's claim is CONFIRMED - the function produces outputs with unequal decimal lengths.

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
The hypothesis test from the bug report fails with multiple counterexamples:
- ['0.00', '0.010'] -> ['0.0', '0.01'] (decimal lengths: [1, 2])
- ['0.00', '0.0000', '0.00000'] -> ['0.0', '0.00', '0.000'] (decimal lengths: [1, 2, 3])

ADDITIONAL TEST CASES:
1. When all inputs have the same number of trailing zeros:
   ['1.200', '2.300', '3.400'] -> ['1.2', '2.3', '3.4'] (all length 1) ✓ EQUAL

2. When inputs have different numbers of trailing zeros:
   ['1.20', '2.300', '3.4000'] -> ['1.2', '2.30', '3.400'] (lengths: [1, 2, 3]) ✗ UNEQUAL

3. Mixed case:
   ['1.10', '2.200', '3.3000'] -> ['1.1', '2.20', '3.300'] (lengths: [1, 2, 3]) ✗ UNEQUAL

ALGORITHM BEHAVIOR:
The function's algorithm:
1. Iteratively removes one trailing zero from ALL decimal numbers
2. Stops when ANY number no longer ends in '0'
3. This causes numbers with fewer trailing zeros to stop trimming first

Example trace for ['0.00', '0.010', '0.0000']:
- Step 1: All end in '0', trim one -> ['0.0', '0.01', '0.000']
- Step 2: '0.01' doesn't end in '0', STOP
- Result: ['0.0', '0.01', '0.000'] with unequal lengths

TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS:
The reproduction confirms that:
1. The function runs without errors
2. The output matches what the bug report claims
3. The function does produce unequal decimal lengths when inputs have different numbers of trailing zeros
4. The hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue
