## Documentation Analysis for kleene_xor

### Function Documentation
The `kleene_xor` function in `mask_ops.py` contains the following documentation:

1. **Docstring** (lines 82-101): States it performs "Boolean xor using Kleene logic" and returns "The result of the logical xor, and the new mask."

2. **Code Comment** (line 105): Explicitly states `# A ^ B == B ^ A`, claiming the operation is commutative.

3. **Implementation Note** (lines 103-107): "To reduce the number of cases, we ensure that `left` & `left_mask` always come from an array, not a scalar. This is safe, since A ^ B == B ^ A"

### External Documentation

#### Pandas Documentation
From the pandas user guide on Boolean data types:
- States that logical operations are "symmetrical, so flipping the left- and right-hand side makes no difference in the result"
- Confirms that `True ^ NA` should result in `NA` (with mask=True)
- Claims the operations follow Kleene three-valued logic

#### Kleene Logic Standards
From Wikipedia and academic sources on three-valued logic:
- In standard Kleene logic, XOR with Unknown (NA) results in Unknown
- Truth tables for Kleene XOR show that `True ⊕ Unknown = Unknown` and `Unknown ⊕ True = Unknown`
- XOR should be commutative in three-valued logic

### Key Findings

1. **The code explicitly claims commutativity twice**:
   - In the comment on line 105
   - In the docstring explanation for why arguments can be swapped

2. **Both internal and external documentation assert XOR should be commutative**:
   - Pandas docs state operations are "symmetrical"
   - Standard Kleene logic maintains commutativity for logical operations

3. **The mask behavior is correct**: Both `True ^ NA` and `NA ^ True` correctly return `mask=True`, indicating the result is NA/Unknown.

4. **The issue is with result array values**: While the mask correctly indicates NA, the underlying result array contains different values (False vs True) depending on operation order. This is an implementation detail that violates the documented commutativity guarantee.

### Documentation Verdict
The documentation is clear and consistent: the XOR operation SHOULD be commutative. The code explicitly documents this requirement in multiple places. The bug report correctly identifies a violation of this documented behavior. This is not a case of unspecified behavior or documentation being wrong - the implementation fails to meet its own documented specification.
