TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

**BUG (Valid Bug Report)**
Arguments FOR:
- The documentation explicitly states "The output will always be a SparseArray" with no exceptions
- The Returns section clearly specifies "SparseArray" as the return type
- The actual behavior (returning numpy.ndarray) directly contradicts the documented contract
- This is not an edge case - it affects all conversions to non-SparseDtype types
- The bug breaks API compatibility for code expecting SparseArray return type
- The fix is straightforward and aligns with documented behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- None. This is a clear contract violation.

**INVALID**
Arguments FOR:
- None. The documentation is explicit and unambiguous.

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation clearly states the expected behavior
- The bug reproduces exactly as reported
- This is not a misunderstanding of the API

**WONTFIX**
Arguments FOR:
- None. This is not an obscure edge case.

Arguments AGAINST:
- This affects common operations (type conversion)
- The issue impacts API consistency and reliability
- Not a trivial or unimportant issue

**FEATURE_REQUEST**
Arguments FOR:
- None. The documentation already promises this behavior.

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The documentation already specifies this should work
- The code is failing to meet its documented contract

**DOCUMENTATION_FIX**
Arguments FOR:
- One could argue the documentation is wrong and should be updated to reflect actual behavior
- Perhaps the original intent was to return ndarray for non-sparse dtypes

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation is very explicit: "will always be a SparseArray"
- The documentation contrasts this with numpy.asarray for getting ndarrays
- All examples show SparseArray being returned
- The docstring appears intentional and well-thought-out
- Changing documentation would break backward compatibility promises

**CONCLUSION**
This is unequivocally a BUG. The implementation violates its explicitly documented contract. The documentation states without ambiguity that the method "will always" return a SparseArray, but it returns a numpy.ndarray for non-SparseDtype conversions. This is not a documentation issue, feature request, or invalid report - it's a clear implementation bug that needs fixing.
