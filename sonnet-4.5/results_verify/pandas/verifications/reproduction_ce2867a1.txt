=== Bug Reproduction Results ===

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The test results confirm the behavior:

1. Initial State:
   - The matplotlib units registry starts with 1 converter (for decimal.Decimal)

2. After register_matplotlib_converters():
   - The registry contains 7 converters (added pandas converters for Timestamp, Period, datetime, date, time, datetime64)

3. After deregister_matplotlib_converters():
   - The registry contains 4 converters instead of the original 1
   - Three extra converters remain: datetime.date, datetime.datetime, numpy.datetime64

The property-based test fails with the exact behavior described in the bug report:
- Initial keys: ["<class 'decimal.Decimal'>"]
- After deregister keys: ["<class 'decimal.Decimal'>", "<class 'datetime.date'>", "<class 'datetime.datetime'>", "<class 'numpy.datetime64'>"]

The bug is reproducible and consistent. Multiple register/deregister cycles show the same pattern - 3 converters are left behind after each deregister.

Technical Analysis:
The issue occurs because when pandas registers its converters, matplotlib hasn't yet registered its default converters for datetime types. However, the act of checking/accessing the registry triggers matplotlib's lazy initialization, which creates default converters. These get cached by pandas in _mpl_units, and then restored during deregister, even though they weren't there initially.

The code flow is:
1. Initial registry is nearly empty
2. pandas.register() checks if converters exist for datetime types
3. This check triggers matplotlib to lazily create default converters
4. pandas caches these newly-created converters in _mpl_units
5. pandas.deregister() restores everything from _mpl_units
6. Result: converters that didn't exist initially are now in the registry

This violates the documented behavior that deregister "attempts to set the state of the registry back to the state before pandas registered its own units."
