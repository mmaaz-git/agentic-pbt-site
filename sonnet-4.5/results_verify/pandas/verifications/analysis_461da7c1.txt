## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation for BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code demonstrably treats complex64 and complex128 differently for mathematically equivalent values
- complex128 uses the formula: hash(real) + 23 * hash(imag)
- complex64 is treated as raw bytes, producing completely different hash values
- This violates the principle that equivalent values should hash consistently
- The fix is straightforward: change np.complex128 to np.complexfloating
- The existing comment suggests ALL complex numbers should be handled specially

**Verdict:** STRONG case for BUG

### Evaluation for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise complex64 and complex128 hash the same way
- The comment mentions "128-bit" specifically, which could mean only complex128 was intended

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- No reasonable justification for treating mathematically identical complex values differently
- The hashing formula for complex numbers (real + 23*imag) is clearly the intended approach
- The current behavior is counterintuitive and breaks user expectations

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID

### Evaluation for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Complex64 is less commonly used than complex128
- Current behavior has existed for some time without major complaints

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects all complex64 arrays
- The inconsistency can cause real issues in data deduplication, grouping, and merging
- The fix is trivial (one-line change)
- The performance impact is negligible

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX

### Evaluation for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't specify how complex numbers are hashed
- Could argue the code works as designed but documentation is incomplete

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The current behavior is clearly unintended
- The comment "handle 128-bit by parts" is misleading but the code is wrong
- Documenting this inconsistency would be admitting a design flaw

**Verdict:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX

### Evaluation for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that complex64 support is a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Complex64 is already supported, just incorrectly
- The hashing formula already exists, it's just not applied to complex64
- This is fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new features

**Verdict:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. The same mathematical values (1+2j) produce different hashes based solely on dtype
2. The existing code has the correct formula but applies it inconsistently
3. The proposed fix (np.complexfloating instead of np.complex128) is correct
4. The comment suggests the intent was to handle complex numbers specially, not just complex128
5. There's no reasonable justification for the current behavior

The bug impacts data integrity in operations that rely on hashing (deduplication, grouping, joins) when complex64 arrays are involved.
