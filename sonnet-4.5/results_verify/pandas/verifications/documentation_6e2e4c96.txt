## Documentation Analysis for waitForNewPaste

### Official Documentation Review

1. **Function Docstring** (from source code):
   ```python
   """This function call blocks until a new text string exists on the
   clipboard that is different from the text that was there when the function
   was first called. It returns this text.

   This function raises PyperclipTimeoutException if timeout was set to
   a number of seconds that has elapsed without non-empty text being put on
   the clipboard."""
   ```

   Key points from the docstring:
   - Explicitly states it waits for "a new **text string**"
   - Says "It returns this **text**"
   - The function is clearly documented to work with text/strings

2. **pandas.io.clipboard Module Documentation**:
   - The module is not officially documented in pandas' public API documentation
   - No entry found at pandas.pydata.org for `waitForNewPaste`
   - This is an internal module, essentially a vendored version of pyperclip

3. **Related Functions**:
   - `waitForPaste()`: Similar function that waits for "non-empty text string"
   - Both functions have consistent documentation about expecting text strings

4. **Type Expectations**:
   - The `_stringifyText()` helper function in the same module only accepts `(str, int, float, bool)` types for copying
   - This suggests the module is designed to work primarily with string data
   - The paste functions are expected to return strings based on their platform implementations

### Documentation Clarity Assessment

The documentation is **CLEAR AND EXPLICIT** about the expected behavior:

1. The function should wait for a "text string" - not just any value
2. It should return "this text" - implying string type
3. The word "text" appears multiple times, consistently referring to string data

### Related Function Comparison

I also examined `waitForPaste()` at line 694:
```python
def waitForPaste(timeout=None):
    """This function call blocks until a non-empty text string exists on the
    clipboard. It returns this text."""
    while True:
        clipboardText = paste()
        if clipboardText != "":  # Only checks for empty string, not type
            return clipboardText
```

This function also has a potential bug - it checks `clipboardText != ""` but doesn't verify the type, so it would fail if `paste()` returns None.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly specifies that `waitForNewPaste()` should:
1. Wait for a "text string" on the clipboard
2. Return "text" (implying string type)

The current implementation violates this documented contract by returning non-string values like None, integers, booleans, lists, or dictionaries. This is a **documentation-code mismatch** where the code doesn't follow the documented behavior.
