## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This could be considered invalid if the documentation is simply aspirational or if there's some other documentation that clarifies this behavior. However, the docstring is explicit and unambiguous with "The output will always be a SparseArray" - there's no room for interpretation here.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation clearly states "The output will always be a SparseArray" with no exceptions. This is a direct, unambiguous statement in the method's docstring. The behavior directly contradicts this statement, making it not an invalid bug report.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue this is a longstanding behavior that users may depend on, and changing it could break existing code. The current behavior might be considered a feature where astype() automatically converts to dense when given non-sparse dtypes, even if the documentation is wrong.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a clear violation of the documented API contract. The documentation explicitly tells users to use numpy.asarray() for dense conversion, implying astype() should not do this. Users who read the documentation would expect SparseArray output and could have bugs in their code due to this mismatch.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current implementation consistently returns numpy arrays for non-sparse dtypes and SparseArrays for sparse dtypes. This appears to be intentional design. The documentation could be updated to say "The output will be a SparseArray when using SparseDtype, otherwise a numpy array" to match the actual behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation explicitly contrasts astype() with numpy.asarray(), saying to use the latter for dense conversion. This suggests the original design intent was for astype() to always return SparseArray. The implementation appears to be the bug, not the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could frame this as requesting new functionality - making astype() always return SparseArray as per the documentation. The current behavior might be considered the baseline, and having it always return SparseArray would be an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not requesting new functionality - the documentation already promises this behavior. The issue is that the implementation doesn't match the documented behavior. This is a bug, not a request for something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation makes an explicit, unambiguous promise: "The output will always be a SparseArray." The implementation violates this promise for non-sparse dtypes. This is a clear API contract violation that can cause issues for users who rely on the documented behavior. The documentation even tells users to use numpy.asarray() for dense conversion, implying astype() shouldn't do this.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Given that approximately 90% of bug reports from this user are invalid, there's a high prior probability this isn't a real bug. The current behavior might be intentional, with the documentation being outdated or incorrect. Many users might depend on the current behavior.

## Overall Consideration

This case presents a clear discrepancy between documented and actual behavior. The documentation explicitly states "The output will always be a SparseArray" - this is not ambiguous or open to interpretation. The method's behavior directly contradicts this statement when non-sparse dtypes are used.

The strongest argument for DOCUMENTATION_FIX is that the current implementation behavior appears consistent and intentional - it returns SparseArray for sparse dtypes and numpy arrays for non-sparse dtypes. This suggests the implementation might be correct and the documentation wrong. The fact that astype() with non-sparse dtypes produces the same output as numpy.asarray() suggests this might be intentional behavior for convenience.

However, the documentation specifically tells users to use numpy.asarray() for dense conversion, which would be redundant if astype() is supposed to do the same thing. This suggests the original design intent was different from the current implementation. Given the high false positive rate of bug reports from this user and the fact that this behavior could be seen as a reasonable design choice (automatic dense conversion for non-sparse dtypes), this is most likely a DOCUMENTATION_FIX where the documentation should be updated to reflect the actual, intentional behavior of the method.
