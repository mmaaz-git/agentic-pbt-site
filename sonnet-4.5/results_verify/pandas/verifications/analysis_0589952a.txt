BUG CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
============================

Evaluating this bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID - Why it might be INVALID:
   - No explicit documentation says comments must preserve '#'
   - Could argue the function works as designed

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The function explicitly attempts to handle comments specially (checks for '#')
   - Stripping '#' from comments breaks Python/Cython syntax
   - The code clearly intends to preserve comments (has special comment handling)
   - Bug is reproducible and causes syntactic corruption

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - Edge case with differently indented comments might be rare
   - Users could work around by ensuring consistent indentation

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - This causes syntactic corruption of valid Python code
   - The fix is trivial (one-line change)
   - Comments at different indentation levels are common in real code
   - Silent corruption of code is a serious issue

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - No documentation exists for this function
   - Could document that comments must have same indent as code

   Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code clearly attempts to handle comments (explicit checks)
   - The bug is in the implementation, not documentation
   - Documenting a limitation that breaks syntax would be wrong
   - The function name implies it should only strip indentation, not mangle content

4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could frame as "add support for differently indented comments"
   - No documentation promises this would work

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The code already tries to handle comments (has comment detection logic)
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
   - The bug causes syntax errors in output, not just missing functionality

5. BUG - Why this IS a BUG:
   - Function mangles syntactically valid Python/Cython code
   - Strips '#' character which changes code semantics
   - Clear logic error: uses stale 'indent' variable from first loop in second loop
   - Function has explicit comment-handling code that doesn't work correctly
   - The proposed fix is a simple correction of an obvious mistake
   - Causes silent corruption that breaks code execution
   - Violates principle of least surprise for a function named "strip_common_indent"

ASSESSMENT:
This is clearly a BUG. The function:
1. Has a logic error using wrong variable (stale 'indent' instead of current match.start())
2. Corrupts syntactically valid Python code
3. Already attempts to handle comments but does so incorrectly
4. Violates reasonable expectations even without documentation
5. The fix is trivial and obvious

The bug is not about undefined behavior or missing features - it's about incorrect implementation of existing comment-handling logic that causes code corruption.
