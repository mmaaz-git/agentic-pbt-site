## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `_dtype_to_na_value` function is an internal pandas function (denoted by the leading underscore) located in
`pandas/core/internals/concat.py`. Its docstring states simply: "Find the NA value to go with this dtype."

### Visibility and API Status
- This is an internal function not exposed in the public pandas API
- No public documentation exists at pandas.pydata.org for this function
- As an internal function, its behavior and implementation are subject to change without notice

### Context and Usage
The function is called during DataFrame concatenation operations when determining appropriate NA values
for different data types. It's used in `_concatenate_join_units` to handle missing values during joins.

### Complex Number Support in Pandas
- Pandas documentation does not explicitly mention support for complex dtypes (complex64, complex128)
- The user guide's dtype section covers integers, floats, and other types but omits complex numbers
- There is no documented specification for how pandas should handle NA values for complex types

### NumPy Complex Type Behavior
- NumPy's complex types (complex64, complex128) accept various string formats for initialization
- In NumPy 2.3.0, both `np.complex128("NaN")` and `np.complex128(np.nan)` are valid
- The behavior of string parsing for complex types is not explicitly documented as guaranteed behavior

### Key Findings
1. The function in question is internal/private (starts with underscore)
2. There is no public API contract for this function
3. Complex number support in pandas is undocumented
4. The specific string parsing behavior ("NaN" vs np.nan) is implementation detail

### Implications
Since this is an internal function with no public documentation or API guarantees, changes to its
implementation or behavior cannot strictly be considered bugs unless they break documented public APIs
that depend on it. The lack of documentation about complex number support suggests this is either
unsupported or implementation-defined behavior.
