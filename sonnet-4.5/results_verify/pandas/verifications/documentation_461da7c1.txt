## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **pandas.util.hash_array documentation:**
   - The function documentation (both in code and online) provides general parameters and behavior
   - NO specific mention of complex number handling
   - NO distinction documented between complex64 and complex128 behavior
   - The documentation simply states it returns "deterministic integers" for input arrays

2. **Code Comments:**
   - Line 293 comment: "_hash_ndarray only takes 64-bit values, so handle 128-bit by parts"
   - This comment suggests the special handling is for values that don't fit in 64 bits
   - However, the comment is misleading because:
     a) It implies the branching is about size (128-bit vs 64-bit)
     b) It doesn't clarify that ALL complex numbers should use the same formula
     c) complex64 (8 bytes) can fit in 64 bits but should still be decomposed into real/imag

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - There is no documented specification stating complex numbers should be hashed differently based on precision
   - Mathematical convention would expect equivalent complex values to hash consistently
   - The formula `hash(real) + 23 * hash(imag)` is implemented for complex128 and appears to be the intended approach for all complex types

### Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation doesn't specify:
   - How complex numbers are hashed
   - Whether complex64 and complex128 should hash the same way
   - The specific formula used for complex number hashing

2. The inline comment on line 293 is ambiguous and could be interpreted as:
   - Only 128-bit values need special handling (current interpretation in code)
   - OR all complex values need special handling (what seems intended)

### Conclusion

The documentation is insufficient to determine the intended behavior. However:
- The existence of the complex number formula (real + 23*imag) for complex128 suggests this is the intended approach for ALL complex types
- There's no reasonable justification for treating complex64 and complex128 differently
- The lack of documentation doesn't excuse the inconsistent behavior
- This is a genuine bug in implementation, not a documentation issue
