DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS: pandas.io.parsers.read_csv Large Integer Handling

## Documentation Review Summary

After extensive review of pandas documentation and related resources, the following findings emerge:

## Official pandas.read_csv Documentation

1. **No explicit documentation about large integer handling**
   - The official read_csv documentation does NOT specify what happens with integers outside int64/uint64 range
   - No mention of automatic conversion to strings for overflow values
   - No documented limitation on integer precision

2. **Type Inference Documentation**
   - States that the parser "attempts to coerce columns to numeric types when possible"
   - Does not define what happens when numeric coercion is not possible within standard bounds
   - No explicit promise about preserving arbitrary-precision integers

3. **dtype Parameter**
   - Documentation shows dtype can be specified explicitly
   - Shows examples with np.int64, 'Int64', object, etc.
   - Does NOT document that 'object' dtype with numeric strings won't be parsed as numbers

4. **converters Parameter**
   - Documentation shows converters can be used for custom type conversion
   - This is presented as an optional feature, not a requirement for large integers

## Related GitHub Issues

1. **Issue #52505 (Incorrect reading of CSV containing large integers)**
   - Confirms this is a known problem
   - Describes it as "silent data corruption"
   - Was marked as resolved with a fix for pyarrow engine
   - However, the default C engine still has this issue

2. **General pandas dtype documentation**
   - States that object dtype is used for "mixed types"
   - Does not specify that large integers should become strings

## Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No specification of integer overflow behavior**
   - Documentation doesn't state that integers outside int64/uint64 become strings
   - No warning about precision loss or type conversion for large values

2. **Round-trip expectations not defined**
   - No explicit guarantee about CSV round-trip preserving data types
   - However, reasonable expectation is that numeric data remains numeric

3. **Inconsistent behavior not documented**
   - int64 values round-trip correctly
   - uint64 values round-trip correctly
   - Values outside these ranges silently become strings
   - This inconsistency is not documented

## CSV Format Considerations

CSV is a text format that doesn't inherently carry type information. However:
- Pandas successfully writes large integers as numeric text
- Other tools (like converters={'col': int}) can read them correctly
- The default behavior could reasonably parse them as integers

## Conclusion

The documentation does NOT specify that large integers should become strings. This behavior is:
1. Undocumented
2. Inconsistent with the handling of int64/uint64 values
3. Surprising to users who expect numeric data to remain numeric
4. Already acknowledged as problematic in GitHub issues

The lack of documentation about this behavior, combined with the inconsistency and the existence of GitHub issues treating it as a bug, suggests this is indeed a bug rather than intended behavior.
