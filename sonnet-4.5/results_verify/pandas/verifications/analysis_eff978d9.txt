## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Strong Evidence:**
- The error message has objectively swapped arguments, showing invalid input where valid options should be
- The message "methodtype must be one of invalid" is nonsensical and misleading
- This violates basic UX principles for error messages
- The fix is trivial and obvious - swap the two variables in the f-string
- This affects all users who pass invalid methodtype values

**Why it IS a bug:**
This is a clear programming error where variables are in the wrong order, creating backwards error messages that confuse users.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Potential Arguments:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly specify the ValueError message format
- It's "just" an error message, not core functionality

**Why it's NOT invalid:**
Error messages don't need documentation to be correct - saying "must be one of invalid" is objectively wrong regardless of documentation. This is like having a sort function return [3,1,2] - it's wrong even without documentation.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Potential Arguments:**
- It only affects error cases when users pass invalid parameters
- Users shouldn't be passing invalid methodtypes anyway
- The error is still raised, just with a confusing message

**Why it's NOT wontfix:**
Error messages are crucial for developer experience. When users make mistakes (which is common), clear error messages help them fix issues quickly. This bug makes debugging harder and wastes developer time.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Potential Arguments:**
- The documentation could specify the ValueError format
- We could document that the error message is backwards

**Why it's NOT a documentation fix:**
The code is clearly wrong - documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct. The fix belongs in the code, not the documentation.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Potential Arguments:**
- Better error messages could be considered a "feature"
- The current code "works" in that it raises an error

**Why it's NOT a feature request:**
This isn't adding new functionality or enhancing existing features. It's fixing an obvious mistake where arguments are swapped. The intended behavior is clear from context.

### Final Assessment

This is unquestionably a **BUG**. The error message has swapped arguments, creating nonsensical output that says "methodtype must be one of [invalid_input]" instead of showing the valid options. This is a simple programming error that violates basic UX principles and makes debugging harder for users. The fix is trivial - swap the two variables in the f-string on line 298.
