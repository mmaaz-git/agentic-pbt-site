BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and behaves exactly as described.

Key Findings:
-------------

1. The bug occurs when `length_of_indexer()` is called with a slice where the start index is greater than or equal to the target array length.

2. Confirmed test cases:
   - slice(1, None) on empty array: Returns -1 instead of 0
   - slice(10, None) on array[0-4]: Returns -5 instead of 0
   - slice(3, None) on array[0-2]: Correctly returns 0 (boundary case works)

3. The function returns negative values in these cases because of the formula:
   (stop - start + step - 1) // step

   When start > stop, this produces negative results. For example:
   - start=1, stop=0, step=1: (0 - 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 = -1
   - start=10, stop=5, step=1: (5 - 10 + 1 - 1) // 1 = -5

4. Real-world Impact Confirmed:
   The `check_setitem_lengths()` function uses `length_of_indexer()` and incorrectly raises a ValueError when trying to assign an empty list to an out-of-bounds slice. This is problematic because:
   - NumPy correctly handles `arr[10:] = []` on a 5-element array as a no-op
   - But pandas' check_setitem_lengths raises: "cannot set using a slice indexer with a different length than the value"
   - This prevents valid no-op assignments that should work

5. The bug violates the fundamental invariant that:
   length_of_indexer(slc, target) should equal len(target[slc])

   This invariant is broken for all cases where the slice start is beyond the array bounds.

The bug is reproducible, has real-world impact, and the proposed fix appears reasonable.
