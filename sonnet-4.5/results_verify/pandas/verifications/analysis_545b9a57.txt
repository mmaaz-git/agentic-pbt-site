## Bug Report Analysis

### Considering Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The code produces objectively incorrect output: start[i] > end[i] violates a fundamental invariant of window bounds
- The class name "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" semantically implies forward-looking windows (positive size)
- The code already validates other semantic constraints (e.g., rejects center=True for forward windows)
- This causes downstream failures in any code that assumes valid window bounds
- The fix is straightforward: validate window_size >= 0

**Arguments Against:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state window_size must be non-negative
- Could argue the behavior is "undefined" rather than "incorrect"

#### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- Documentation never explicitly states window_size must be >= 0
- The code technically "works" - it produces output without crashing
- User is providing input that doesn't make semantic sense

**Arguments Against:**
- The output violates mathematical invariants (start <= end)
- The class name clearly implies forward-looking behavior
- Just because documentation doesn't prohibit something doesn't mean nonsensical behavior is acceptable

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- This is an obscure edge case - users wouldn't normally pass negative window sizes
- The semantic meaning of "forward window" makes negative sizes nonsensical
- Users passing negative values are misusing the API

**Arguments Against:**
- The fix is trivial (add one validation check)
- The current behavior produces objectively incorrect output
- Even if obscure, it violates fundamental invariants

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be viewed as a request to add input validation that doesn't currently exist
- The code wasn't designed to handle negative window sizes

**Arguments Against:**
- This isn't adding new functionality, it's fixing broken behavior
- The current output is incorrect, not just missing

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation could be clearer about valid window_size values
- Could update docs to explicitly state window_size must be >= 0

**Arguments Against:**
- The code behavior is incorrect regardless of documentation
- This is a code bug, not just a documentation issue
- Fixing only documentation would leave broken behavior in place

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code produces mathematically invalid output (start > end) that violates fundamental window bound invariants. The semantic meaning of "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" strongly implies forward-looking (positive) windows. The fact that the code already validates other semantic constraints (like rejecting center=True) shows it's intended to enforce meaningful behavior. The fix is trivial and prevents objectively incorrect output.
