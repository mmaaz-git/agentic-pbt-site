# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Category: BUG

### Why this might be a BUG:
1. **Silent data corruption**: Finite values become infinity without warning or error
2. **Violates reasonable expectations**: A data analysis library should preserve numeric values by default
3. **Inconsistent with standard library**: Python's json module handles this correctly with default settings
4. **Loss of valid data**: The value 1.7976931345e+308 is a valid finite float that gets corrupted
5. **Round-trip property violated**: ujson_loads(ujson_dumps(x)) â‰  x for valid inputs
6. **No documentation warning**: Users aren't warned about this limitation

### Strength: STRONG
This is clearly a bug - valid finite data becomes invalid (infinity) through normal use of the library with default settings.

## Category: INVALID

### Why this might be INVALID:
1. The documentation does state double_precision defaults to 10
2. User could argue they should use higher precision for edge cases

### Strength: VERY WEAK
The bug is reproducible and causes actual data loss. The documentation doesn't warn about overflow, and users reasonably expect finite values to remain finite.

## Category: WONTFIX

### Why this might be WONTFIX:
1. Edge case affecting only values very close to float maximum
2. Workaround exists (set double_precision=15)
3. Changing default might affect performance or file sizes
4. Backwards compatibility concerns - existing code might depend on current behavior

### Strength: WEAK
While it's an edge case, data integrity is fundamental for a data analysis library. The fix is simple and improves correctness.

## Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX

### Why this might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
1. Code works as designed with double_precision=10
2. Documentation could warn about precision loss for extreme values
3. Could document that round-trip is not guaranteed with default settings
4. Could clarify "decimal places" vs "significant digits"

### Strength: MODERATE
While documentation improvements would help, the core issue is that default behavior causes data corruption.

## Category: FEATURE_REQUEST

### Why this might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
1. Could argue that perfect round-trip fidelity is a new feature
2. Request to change default behavior could be seen as enhancement

### Strength: WEAK
This isn't requesting new functionality - it's asking for correct handling of valid input data.

## Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The key factors are:

1. **Data integrity violation**: Valid finite floats become infinity - this is data corruption
2. **Silent failure**: No warning or error when precision loss occurs
3. **Reasonable expectations**: In a data analysis library, numeric fidelity is fundamental
4. **Simple fix available**: Changing default to 15 (max allowed) would fix it
5. **Precedent**: Standard library json preserves these values correctly

The fact that it only affects edge cases near float boundaries doesn't negate that it's a bug - it's still corrupting valid data. The library should either:
- Use sufficient precision by default (recommended fix)
- Raise an error when precision loss would cause overflow
- At minimum, document this limitation clearly

Since pandas is specifically designed for data analysis where numeric accuracy matters, silently converting finite values to infinity is a bug that should be fixed.
