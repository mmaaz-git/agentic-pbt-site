## Bug Reproduction Results

### Main Test Case
The bug report's main example was successfully reproduced:
- Input: DataFrame with single cell containing one space character (' ')
- CSV output: 'col0\n \n'
- After read_csv: Empty DataFrame with 0 rows (original had 1 row)
- **Result: Data loss confirmed**

### Property-Based Test
The Hypothesis test from the bug report failed immediately with the simple case of data=[[' ']], confirming the issue exists with whitespace-only data.

### Extended Testing Results

1. **Single column with whitespace only**:
   - Single space: LOST (1 row -> 0 rows)
   - Multiple spaces: LOST (1 row -> 0 rows)
   - Tab character: LOST (1 row -> 0 rows)

2. **Multiple columns with whitespace**:
   - Row with [' ', '  ', '   ']: PRESERVED (1 row -> 1 row)
   - This shows the behavior is inconsistent - multiple whitespace fields preserve the row

3. **Mixed content**:
   - DataFrame with ['a'], [' '], ['b']: Middle row LOST (3 rows -> 2 rows)
   - The whitespace-only row is silently dropped

4. **Empty string vs whitespace**:
   - Empty string ['']: PRESERVED (1 row -> 1 row)
   - Single space [' ']: LOST (1 row -> 0 rows)
   - This shows pandas treats empty strings differently from whitespace

5. **Special characters**:
   - Newline character ['\n']: PRESERVED (1 row -> 1 row)

### Workaround Verification
Using `skip_blank_lines=False` successfully preserves the whitespace row:
- With skip_blank_lines=False: 1 row preserved, value ' ' correctly maintained

### Technical Details
The CSV file generated by to_csv() for a single space is valid:
- Header: 'col0\n'
- Data row: ' \n' (a space followed by newline)

This is valid CSV data that should represent a row with a single-space value. The default read_csv() behavior treats this as a "blank line" and skips it, causing data loss.
