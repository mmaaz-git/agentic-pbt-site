## Documentation Analysis

### _check_expression Docstring (Internal Function)
From pandas/core/computation/eval.py lines 109-121:
```
Make sure an expression is not an empty string

Parameters
----------
expr : object
    An object that can be converted to a string

Raises
------
ValueError
  * If expr is an empty string
```

Key observations:
1. The docstring explicitly states it should ensure "an expression is not an empty string"
2. It promises to raise ValueError "If expr is an empty string"
3. The documentation doesn't distinguish between empty strings and whitespace-only strings
4. Semantically, a whitespace-only string IS an empty expression (contains no meaningful expression content)

### pandas.eval() Documentation
From the official pandas API documentation and the docstring in eval.py:
- The `expr` parameter must be a "string" representing a Python expression
- It "cannot contain any Python statements, only Python expressions"
- The documentation states it will raise ValueError but doesn't specify all cases
- No explicit mention of how whitespace-only strings should be handled

### Test Coverage
Existing tests in pandas/tests/computation/test_eval.py:
- There IS a test for empty string: `test_empty_string_raises` (line 1865)
- This test verifies that pd.eval("") raises ValueError
- There are NO tests for whitespace-only strings like " ", "\t", "\n", "\r"
- No tests assert that whitespace strings should return None

### Documentation Intent vs Implementation
The documentation for _check_expression clearly indicates the function's purpose is to:
1. "Make sure an expression is not an empty string" (title)
2. Raise ValueError "If expr is an empty string"

A whitespace-only string:
- Contains no valid Python expression
- Is semantically empty from a code evaluation perspective
- Cannot be evaluated to produce any meaningful result
- Is functionally equivalent to an empty string for expression evaluation purposes

### Conclusion
The documentation strongly suggests that whitespace-only strings should be treated the same as empty strings:
1. They contain no evaluable expression
2. The function's stated purpose is to ensure expressions aren't empty
3. Returning None for whitespace is undocumented behavior
4. The inconsistency between "" and " " violates the principle of least surprise
