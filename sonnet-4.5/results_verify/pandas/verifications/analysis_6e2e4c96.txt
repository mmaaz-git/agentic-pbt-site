## Triage Analysis for waitForNewPaste Bug Report

### Considering BUG Classification

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The function's docstring explicitly states it waits for "a new text string" and returns "this text"
2. The current implementation violates this contract by returning non-string values (None, 0, False, [], {})
3. The bug can occur in real-world scenarios (e.g., macOS with pyobjc where paste() returns None for non-text clipboard data)
4. The proposed fix is simple and correct: add `isinstance(currentText, str)` check
5. The function name itself implies waiting for text ("Paste" typically refers to text operations)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None significant - the documentation is clear about expecting text strings

### Considering INVALID Classification

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The function is in an internal/vendored module not part of pandas' public API
2. Users shouldn't directly use pandas.io.clipboard functions

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function is accessible and importable
2. The documentation explicitly promises text string behavior
3. The bug is real and reproducible
4. Internal functions should still follow their documented contracts

### Considering WONTFIX Classification

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. This is an edge case that may rarely occur in practice
2. Most clipboard operations deal with text, so non-text returns are uncommon
3. The module is vendored from pyperclip, not core pandas functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The fix is trivial (one line change)
2. The bug can cause unexpected behavior and type errors
3. It's not an obscure edge case - it can happen whenever clipboard contains non-text data
4. The severity is medium, not trivial

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Could update docs to say "returns whatever paste() returns when it changes"
2. Could document that non-string values may be returned in some cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function name and purpose clearly indicate it should wait for text
2. Changing the documentation would make the function less useful
3. The intent is clear: wait for NEW PASTE (text), not just any change
4. The fix to make code match docs is simpler than changing docs to match buggy code

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST Classification

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Handling non-string clipboard data could be seen as a new feature
2. Type checking could be considered an enhancement

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The docstring already promises this behavior - it's not a new feature
2. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capabilities
3. The function already claims to wait for "text string" - making it do so isn't a feature

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Clear documentation violation**: The docstring unambiguously states the function waits for "a new text string" and returns "this text"
2. **Realistic scenario**: Can occur on macOS when clipboard contains non-text data
3. **Simple, correct fix**: Adding type check makes the function behave as documented
4. **Not trivial**: Can cause type errors and unexpected behavior in applications
5. **Well-defined expected behavior**: The documentation leaves no ambiguity about what should happen

The function fails to implement its documented contract. When documentation clearly specifies behavior and the implementation doesn't match, it's a bug in the code, not the documentation.
