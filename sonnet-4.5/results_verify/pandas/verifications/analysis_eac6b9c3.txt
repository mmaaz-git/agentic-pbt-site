## Bug Report Analysis

### BUG (Most Likely Classification)

**Why this should be classified as BUG:**
1. **Violates reasonable expectations:** Empty strings are not valid date representations in any common date format
2. **Breaks round-trip property:** A fundamental expectation for JSON serialization is that `deserialize(serialize(x)) == x` for supported types
3. **Silent data corruption:** The conversion happens without warning, changing the data type and value
4. **Inconsistent with explicit conversions:** `pd.to_datetime('')` with default settings raises an error, but read_json silently converts to NaT
5. **Has a workaround:** The fact that `convert_dates=False` fixes it suggests the automatic conversion is overly aggressive
6. **Data loss:** An empty string carries different semantic meaning than NaT (missing time value)

### INVALID (Less Likely)

**Arguments against (weak):**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise round-trip preservation
- User could argue that automatic type inference is best-effort
- The convert_dates parameter provides control

**Counter-arguments:**
- Empty string is clearly not a date format
- Round-trip is a reasonable expectation even if not documented
- Default behavior should be sensible

### WONTFIX (Unlikely)

**Why this is unlikely to be WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty strings are common in data
- The issue affects basic data integrity
- It's not about internal implementation details
- The fix appears straightforward

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Unlikely)

**Why this is not just a documentation issue:**
- Even if documented, converting empty strings to dates is counterintuitive
- The behavior is more likely a bug than an intentional feature to document
- Users would not expect to check documentation for such basic behavior

### FEATURE_REQUEST (Very Unlikely)

**Why this is not a feature request:**
- The report is about fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- Round-trip preservation is a basic expectation, not an enhancement
- The issue is with existing default behavior

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The automatic date conversion is too aggressive and incorrectly treats empty strings as parseable dates, converting them to NaT. This violates reasonable expectations about data preservation and round-trip serialization. An empty string is fundamentally not a date representation and should not be converted to a datetime type without explicit user intent.
