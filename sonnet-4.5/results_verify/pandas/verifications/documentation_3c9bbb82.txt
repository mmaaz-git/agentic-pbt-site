## Documentation Analysis for SparseArray.map()

### Source Code Documentation

The method's docstring in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/arrays/sparse/array.py` (lines 1319-1355) states:

**Key Claims:**
1. Line 1331: "The output array will have the same density as the input."
2. Line 1332-1333: "The output fill value will be the result of applying the mapping to `self.fill_value`"

**Parameters Documented:**
- mapper: dict, Series, callable - The correspondence from old values to new
- na_action: {None, 'ignore'} - If 'ignore', propagate NA values

**Examples Provided:**
The docstring includes examples showing successful mapping operations, but notably none of the examples demonstrate or warn about the case where a sparse value maps to the fill value.

### Base Class Documentation

SparseArray inherits from ExtensionArray, which has its own map method with different documentation:
- ExtensionArray.map() documentation does not mention density preservation
- It has a more general contract about mapping values
- The base implementation delegates to `map_array()`

### Online Documentation

1. **Current pandas docs (2.3.2)**: The SparseArray class page doesn't explicitly list the map method in its API documentation, suggesting it may be considered an internal or inherited method.

2. **Historical documentation**: Found references to SparseArray.map in pandas 0.24 documentation, but with limited details.

### Key Documentation Issues

1. **Undocumented Restriction**: The docstring does not document the critical restriction that sparse values cannot be mapped to the fill value. This is a significant limitation that users need to know about.

2. **Misleading Promise**: The claim "The output array will have the same density as the input" is unconditionally stated, but the implementation enforces this by raising an error rather than by ensuring it through recalculation.

3. **No Warning in Examples**: None of the provided examples show the failure case or warn users about this restriction.

4. **Inconsistent with Base Class**: The SparseArray.map() has additional restrictions not present in the base ExtensionArray.map() but these are not clearly documented.

### Conclusion

The documentation is incomplete and misleading. It promises density preservation without explaining that this is enforced by rejecting certain valid mappings rather than by handling them correctly. The restriction that sparse values cannot map to fill values is a critical limitation that should be prominently documented.
