## Documentation Analysis for pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable

### Official Documentation
The function `pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable(obj)` is documented both in the API reference and in the source code docstring.

### Function Purpose (from docstring)
- "Check if the object can be compiled into a regex pattern instance."
- Returns: "bool - Whether `obj` can be compiled as a regex pattern."

### Current Implementation
The implementation (lines 187-192 in inference.py) shows:
```python
try:
    re.compile(obj)
except TypeError:
    return False
else:
    return True
```

### Key Observations
1. The documentation explicitly states this function should CHECK if an object can be compiled - it's meant to be a validation/checking function that returns a boolean.

2. The documented examples show:
   - `is_re_compilable(".*")` returns `True` (valid regex)
   - `is_re_compilable(1)` returns `False` (non-string type)

3. The implementation currently only catches `TypeError`, which handles cases where the input is not a string-like object (e.g., integers, None).

4. The documentation does NOT specify what should happen with invalid regex patterns (malformed strings that are strings but not valid regex). However, the function name "is_re_compilable" and the docstring "Check if the object can be compiled" strongly suggest this is a predicate function that should return False for ANY object that cannot be compiled, not just non-string objects.

5. The function is part of the public API (`pandas.api.types`) and is meant to be used by users to check compilability before attempting regex operations.

### Documentation Clarity
The documentation is reasonably clear that this function should determine whether something CAN be compiled as a regex. The natural expectation from both the name and description is that it would return False for invalid regex patterns like ')' rather than raising an exception.
