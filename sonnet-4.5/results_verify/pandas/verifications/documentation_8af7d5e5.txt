## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review
I reviewed the official pandas documentation for both `hash_array` and `hash_pandas_object` functions:

1. **pandas.util.hash_array**: The documentation provides only a basic description stating "Given a 1d array, return an array of deterministic integers." There is no mention of:
   - How different dtypes are handled
   - Specific behavior for complex numbers
   - Consistency guarantees across different precision types
   - The formula used for complex number hashing

2. **pandas.util.hash_pandas_object**: Similarly minimal documentation with no details about complex number handling or dtype-specific behaviors.

### Code Comments
The only relevant documentation is an inline comment at line 293 in the source code:
```python
# _hash_ndarray only takes 64-bit values, so handle 128-bit by parts
```

This comment explains why complex128 gets special handling but doesn't establish any principle about consistency across complex number types.

### Documentation Gaps
- No explicit documentation states that complex numbers of different precisions should hash consistently
- No documentation explains the `hash(real) + 23 * hash(imag)` formula for complex numbers
- No documentation indicates whether complex64 and complex128 should produce the same or different hashes for equivalent values
- The behavior is essentially undocumented implementation detail

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify how complex numbers should be hashed, making this behavior essentially undefined from a documentation perspective. However, there's a reasonable expectation that the same logical data type (complex numbers) should be hashed consistently regardless of precision, especially given that pandas generally aims for consistency in operations across different numeric precisions.
