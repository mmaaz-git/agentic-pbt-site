# Reproduction Analysis

## Issue Verification
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.io._util._arrow_dtype_mapping().

## Key Findings:

1. **Source Code Inspection**:
   - Confirmed duplicate key at lines 41 and 44 in /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/_util.py
   - Both lines contain: `pa.string(): pd.StringDtype()`

2. **AST Analysis Test**:
   - The provided test code correctly identifies the duplicate
   - Found 14 keys in the dictionary literal
   - Only 13 unique keys exist
   - Duplicate key identified: 'pa.string()'

3. **Runtime Behavior**:
   - At runtime, the dictionary contains only 13 entries (not 14)
   - The second `pa.string()` entry (line 44) overwrites the first (line 41)
   - This follows Python's standard behavior where duplicate keys in dict literals result in the last value being retained
   - The first entry at line 41 is effectively dead code that has no effect

## Effect of the Bug:
The duplicate key means that one dictionary entry is silently lost. While both entries map to the same value (pd.StringDtype()), this represents:
- Dead code that serves no purpose
- Potential confusion about intent
- Possible indication of a missing mapping (perhaps one was meant to be a different PyArrow type)

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
