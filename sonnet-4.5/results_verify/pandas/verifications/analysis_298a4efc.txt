## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function fails when given infinity values, which is a limitation of the underlying matplotlib library, not necessarily a pandas bug. Matplotlib doesn't support infinity as axis limits, and this is a reasonable restriction for a plotting library. The user could preprocess their data to remove infinity values before plotting, which is a common practice in data visualization. The error message is clear about the problem ("Axis limits cannot be NaN or Inf").

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
DataFrames can legitimately contain infinity values from valid mathematical operations (division by zero, logarithms, etc.), and the documentation doesn't state that infinity values are forbidden. Other pandas plotting functions like df.plot() and df.plot.scatter() handle infinity values without crashing. The function already handles NaN values by filtering them, so it's reasonable to expect similar handling for infinity.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case that occurs with infinity values, which are relatively uncommon in typical data analysis workflows. The error comes from matplotlib, not pandas itself, and changing this behavior would require working around matplotlib's limitations. The workaround is simple - users can filter infinity values before plotting. The current error message is informative enough for users to understand what went wrong.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency between different pandas plotting functions suggests this isn't just an accepted limitation. Some functions handle infinity while others don't, indicating there's room for improvement. The fix would be relatively simple (filter infinity values like NaN is filtered) and would improve user experience. DataFrames explicitly support infinity as valid values.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't mention that infinity values will cause the function to fail, which is a documentation gap. Adding a note about this limitation would help users understand the expected behavior. The function's current behavior might be intentional, and documenting it would clarify the design decision. This is the least disruptive solution that still addresses the user's confusion.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting the limitation doesn't fix the inconsistency with other pandas plotting functions. If df.plot() can handle infinity, users would reasonably expect scatter_matrix to handle it too. The code already has logic to filter NaN values, suggesting that special value handling was considered in the design. Documentation alone doesn't address the underlying usability issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding infinity handling would be a new feature that extends the current functionality. The function wasn't originally designed to handle infinity values, as evidenced by the lack of filtering. This would be an enhancement to make the function more robust. It aligns with making pandas plotting functions more consistent in their behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Handling special float values (NaN, inf) is typically considered basic functionality for numerical libraries, not a feature. The function already handles NaN, so infinity handling would be completing existing functionality rather than adding new features. DataFrames inherently support infinity, so plotting functions should too. Other pandas functions already handle this, so it's more about consistency than new functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with a valid DataFrame that contains legitimate float values (infinity is a valid IEEE 754 float). The documentation doesn't forbid infinity values, creating an undocumented failure mode. The function already filters NaN values but inconsistently doesn't filter infinity, suggesting an oversight. Other pandas plotting functions handle infinity, indicating this is unexpected behavior. The proposed fix is straightforward and follows the existing pattern for NaN handling.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The error originates from matplotlib, not from pandas code directly. The current behavior might be intentional to preserve the mathematical properties of the data. Infinity in scatter plots could be misleading or meaningless from a visualization perspective. The error message clearly indicates the problem, and users can easily work around it. Not all plotting functions are expected to handle all edge cases identically.

## Overall Consideration

After examining all aspects, this appears to be a DOCUMENTATION_FIX rather than a bug. Here's why:

First, the function's behavior is technically correct from matplotlib's perspective - infinity values cannot be meaningfully displayed as axis limits in a plot. While DataFrames support infinity values, not all operations on DataFrames need to support all possible values. The error message is clear and comes from the underlying plotting library, not from a pandas-specific failure.

Second, while there is inconsistency between pandas plotting functions, this doesn't automatically make it a bug. Different plotting types have different mathematical requirements. Scatter plots specifically need finite axis ranges to be meaningful, whereas line plots can clip infinity values at the plot boundaries. The fact that plot.hist() and plot.kde() also fail with infinity suggests this is a category of functions with specific mathematical constraints.

Third, the most appropriate resolution is to document this limitation clearly. Users should be informed that scatter_matrix requires finite values and that infinity/NaN values should be filtered or replaced before plotting. This aligns with general data visualization best practices where data cleaning precedes visualization. Adding a note to the documentation would prevent user confusion while maintaining the current, mathematically sound behavior.

The bug report's suggested fix of filtering infinity values like NaN would actually hide important information from users - if their data contains infinity, they should make an explicit decision about how to handle it rather than having it silently filtered.
