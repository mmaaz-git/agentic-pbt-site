## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review:

1. **Docstring in Source Code** (lines 273-292 in pandas/errors/__init__.py):
   - The docstring provides examples showing proper usage
   - For classmethod: `raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(cls, methodtype="classmethod")`
   - For regular method: `raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(self)`
   - The example clearly shows that when `methodtype="classmethod"`, the first parameter should be `cls` (the class itself)

2. **Parameter Documentation**:
   - The parameter is named `class_instance` but can accept either a class or an instance
   - No explicit type hints or validation that enforce `class_instance` to be a class when `methodtype="classmethod"`
   - The documentation example shows the correct usage but doesn't explicitly state that passing an instance with `methodtype="classmethod"` is invalid

3. **Online pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError Documentation**:
   - Confirms the same usage patterns as the docstring
   - Shows that for classmethods, the convention is to pass the class (`cls`)
   - Does not explicitly forbid passing an instance when `methodtype="classmethod"`

### Key Observations:

1. **Implicit vs Explicit Requirements**:
   - The documentation shows by example that classmethods should receive `cls` (the class)
   - However, there is NO explicit statement that says "when methodtype='classmethod', class_instance MUST be a class"
   - The parameter name `class_instance` is ambiguous - it could mean "class or instance"

2. **Documentation Gap**:
   - The documentation doesn't warn users about what happens if they pass an instance with `methodtype="classmethod"`
   - There's no validation or error message explaining the proper usage when incorrect parameters are provided

3. **Expected Behavior from Examples**:
   - The examples clearly demonstrate the intended usage pattern
   - A reasonable user following the examples would pass a class for classmethods
   - However, a user making a mistake gets a cryptic AttributeError instead of a helpful error message

### Conclusion:

While the documentation examples show the correct usage pattern (passing a class for classmethods), it does not explicitly document that this is a requirement. The code itself doesn't validate this assumption, leading to a confusing AttributeError when users make this mistake. This is a gap between the implied contract (from examples) and the actual implementation's error handling.
