## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Success
The bug has been successfully reproduced. The issue is confirmed as reported.

### Test Results

1. **Simple Reproduction Test**:
   - Running the provided reproduction code confirms the exact behavior described in the bug report
   - `_parse_datetime(0.5, 'd')` returns `1960-01-01 12:00:00`
   - `_convert_datetimes([0.5], 'd')` returns `1960-01-01 00:00:00`
   - The difference is exactly 12 hours (0.5 days)

2. **Extended Testing with Multiple Values**:
   - Tested with values: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.5, 2.33
   - All fractional day components are truncated by `_convert_datetimes`
   - `_parse_datetime` correctly preserves fractional components in all cases
   - Examples:
     - 0.25 days: loses 6 hours
     - 0.75 days: loses 18 hours
     - 2.33 days: loses 7 hours 55 minutes 12 seconds

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug is located in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/sas/sas7bdat.py`:

1. **Line 75** in `_parse_datetime`:
   ```python
   return datetime(1960, 1, 1) + timedelta(days=sas_datetime)
   ```
   This correctly preserves fractional days because `timedelta(days=)` accepts and preserves float values.

2. **Line 107** in `_convert_datetimes`:
   ```python
   vals = np.array(sas_datetimes, dtype="M8[D]") + td
   ```
   This truncates fractional days because `dtype="M8[D]"` creates datetime64 with day precision, which only stores whole days.

### Impact

The bug causes:
1. **Data Loss**: Fractional day components (hours, minutes, seconds) are silently discarded
2. **Inconsistency**: Two functions designed to handle the same SAS datetime conversion produce different results
3. **Silent Failure**: No warning or error is raised when precision is lost

The bug is real and affects any SAS data that includes fractional day values when the unit is 'd'.
