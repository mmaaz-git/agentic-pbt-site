# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Category: BUG
**Why this is a BUG:**
- The code crashes with a RecursionError when calling cumsum() on a valid SparseArray
- The documentation explicitly states cumsum() should work and return a result with NaN fill value
- The infinite recursion is caused by a logic error in the implementation
- This is not edge-case behavior - it affects all SparseArrays with non-null fill values (e.g., 0 for integers)
- The cumulative sum is a fundamental array operation that should work

## Not INVALID
**Why this is NOT INVALID:**
- The bug report correctly identifies actual broken behavior
- The documentation supports that this should work
- The test case is reasonable and uses valid inputs
- The infinite recursion is clearly unintended behavior
- The proposed fix addresses the actual root cause

## Not WONTFIX
**Why this is NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects common usage (integer arrays with fill_value=0)
- The cumsum() operation is a core array method, not an obscure feature
- The crash is severe (RecursionError) and not a minor inconvenience
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't require major refactoring

## Not DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why this is NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
- The code fails to implement what the documentation promises
- The documentation states "the fill value will be `np.nan` regardless", implying any input fill value should work
- This is a code bug, not a documentation error

## Not FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why this is NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- cumsum() already exists and is documented
- The bug report isn't asking for new functionality
- The expected behavior (working cumsum with non-null fill values) is already promised by the documentation
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

## Summary
This is a clear **BUG**. The cumsum() method enters infinite recursion when called on SparseArrays with non-null fill values due to a logic error in the implementation. The bug violates the documented behavior which promises that cumsum() will work and return results with NaN fill value. The proposed fix correctly addresses the root cause by ensuring the result uses a null fill value to avoid re-entering the same code path.
