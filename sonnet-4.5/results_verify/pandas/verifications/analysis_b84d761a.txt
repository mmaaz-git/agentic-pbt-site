## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
These bugs describe actual technical issues that exist in the code. Bug 1 is a clear case of swapped parameters in an f-string that creates a confusing error message. Bug 2 is a real AttributeError that occurs when using the class. Neither of these can be dismissed as incorrect reports - the code genuinely behaves as described.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bugs are accurately reported with reproducible test cases. The swapped parameters bug makes error messages confusing for users, and the AttributeError crash is a real runtime failure. The report correctly identifies the exact line numbers where the issues occur and provides working reproduction code.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
These are internal error classes that most users won't interact with directly. AbstractMethodError is primarily used internally by pandas developers for marking abstract methods. The parameter name confusion in the validation error only affects developers who pass wrong arguments, and they'll still get an error (just with a confusing message). The classmethod issue only occurs if someone misuses the API by passing an instance when they should pass a class.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The first bug creates genuinely confusing error messages that could mislead developers trying to debug their code. When an error message says "methodtype must be one of invalid_type", it's actively harmful to understanding. The second bug causes a crash with an unhelpful AttributeError instead of the intended error message, making debugging harder. These affect developer experience even if they're edge cases.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state that when methodtype='classmethod', the class_instance parameter must be a class object rather than an instance. The existing docstring example at line 290-291 has its own error (showing the same message for both classmethod and regular method). The documentation could be updated to clarify the expected parameter types for different methodtype values.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The swapped parameter bug is clearly a code error, not a documentation issue - the error message format is objectively wrong. While better documentation could help with Bug 2, the fact that the code crashes with an AttributeError rather than providing a helpful message is still a code defect, not just a documentation gap.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding validation to ensure class_instance is actually a class when methodtype='classmethod' would be a new feature that improves error handling. Making the __str__ method more defensive to handle both classes and instances gracefully could be seen as an enhancement rather than a bug fix. The current code works fine when used as intended (passing a class for classmethods).

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The swapped parameters in Bug 1 is clearly a bug, not a missing feature - the code already tries to show an error message but gets it wrong. For Bug 2, when code crashes with an AttributeError instead of working as designed, that's a bug in the implementation, not a request for new functionality. The __str__ method should already handle its designed use cases without crashing.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Bug 1 is an objective error where the f-string on line 298 has swapped the positions of the methodtype and types variables, creating backwards error messages. This is a clear programming mistake that makes the error message say the opposite of what it should. Bug 2 shows the __str__ method crashing with AttributeError when it should produce a string - a failure of basic functionality. Both issues have clear fixes and make the code behave incorrectly compared to its obvious intent.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
These are edge cases in an internal error class that most users never directly instantiate. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that passing an instance with methodtype='classmethod' should work. While the swapped message is confusing, users still get an error and can figure out the issue. The bugs are in error handling paths rather than core functionality.

**Overall consideration**
The bug report identifies two real technical issues in pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError. Bug 1 is unambiguously a programming error - the f-string on line 298 has the variables in the wrong order, causing error messages to say "methodtype must be one of [invalid_value]" instead of "methodtype must be one of [valid_values]". This is objectively wrong and harmful to users trying to debug their code.

Bug 2 is slightly more nuanced but still represents a defect. When methodtype='classmethod', the __str__ method assumes class_instance has a __name__ attribute (line 305), but there's no validation to ensure this assumption holds. This causes an unhelpful AttributeError instead of the intended AbstractMethodError message. While one could argue users shouldn't pass instances for classmethods, good error handling should either validate inputs or handle edge cases gracefully.

Given that both issues represent actual defects in the code's implementation (not missing features or documentation gaps), and that Bug 1 in particular is an unambiguous programming error with a trivial fix, this should be classified as a BUG. The issues may be minor in impact, but they are genuine bugs that make the code behave incorrectly compared to its clear intent.
