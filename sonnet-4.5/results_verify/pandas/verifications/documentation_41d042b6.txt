## Documentation Analysis for _excel2num

### Function Documentation
The function has inline documentation in the source code:

```python
def _excel2num(x: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert Excel column name like 'AB' to 0-based column index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : str
        The Excel column name to convert to a 0-based column index.

    Returns
    -------
    num : int
        The column index corresponding to the name.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Part of the Excel column name was invalid.
    """
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Purpose**: Converts Excel column names (like 'A', 'B', 'AA', etc.) to 0-based column indices
2. **Input**: A string representing an Excel column name
3. **Output**: An integer representing the 0-based column index
4. **Documented Exception**: Raises ValueError when "Part of the Excel column name was invalid"

### Excel Column Naming Convention (External Research)

Based on web research of Excel specifications:
- Excel columns follow the pattern: A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ..., AZ, BA, ..., ZZ, AAA, etc.
- Valid column names consist only of uppercase letters A-Z
- Column indices start at 0 (A=0, B=1, etc.)
- Excel supports up to 16,384 columns (up to column XFD)
- **Empty strings are NOT valid Excel column names**
- When Excel encounters empty column headers in actual spreadsheets, it automatically replaces them with placeholders like "empty_XX"

### Documentation Interpretation

1. **The contract is clear**: The function should raise ValueError for invalid column names
2. **Empty strings are invalid**: Based on Excel's own behavior and specifications, an empty string is not a valid column name
3. **The docstring covers this case**: "Part of the Excel column name was invalid" applies to empty strings since there is no "part" to validate
4. **Return value expectation**: The function returns "The column index corresponding to the name" - there is no Excel column that corresponds to an empty name

### Internal vs. Public API Consideration

- The function name starts with underscore (_excel2num), indicating it's an internal/private function
- However, it's used by other internal functions like _range2cols which could be called by public APIs
- The function has proper docstring documentation, suggesting it's meant to have a well-defined contract
- Internal functions still need to maintain consistent behavior, especially when they can affect user-facing functionality

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly states that ValueError should be raised for invalid column names. Empty strings are definitively invalid Excel column names based on Excel's own specifications and behavior. The current implementation violates the documented contract by returning -1 instead of raising ValueError for empty/whitespace-only inputs.
