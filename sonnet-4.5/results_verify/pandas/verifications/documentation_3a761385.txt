## Documentation Analysis

### pandas.DataFrame.to_excel Documentation

The documentation states:
- `na_rep` parameter: "Missing data representation" with default value of an empty string (`''`)
- This means NaN values are written as empty strings by default
- No explicit documentation about how empty strings themselves are handled

### pandas.read_excel Documentation

The documentation explains:
- `na_filter` (default True): Detects missing value markers
- `keep_default_na` (default True): Controls inclusion of default NaN values
- When `na_filter=False`: Ignores NA detection entirely
- When `keep_default_na=False` with `na_filter=True`: Only recognizes explicitly specified NA values

Key finding: The documentation mentions that by default, empty strings ('') are recognized as NA/NaN values during reading.

### Round-Trip Guarantees

**No explicit round-trip guarantees found** in the pandas documentation for Excel operations. The documentation does not promise that `read_excel(to_excel(df))` will preserve the original data exactly.

This is in contrast to other formats like:
- Pickle: Explicitly guarantees perfect round-trip
- Parquet: Generally preserves data types and values
- CSV: Has known limitations but documented

### Excel Format Limitations

The fundamental issue stems from Excel's data model:
- Excel doesn't distinguish between an empty string and an empty cell
- Empty cells in Excel are typically interpreted as missing/null values
- This is a limitation of the Excel format itself, not necessarily pandas

### Documentation Gap

The documentation fails to:
1. Warn users that empty strings will be converted to NaN during round-trip
2. Explain that rows containing only empty values may be lost entirely
3. Provide clear guidance on preserving empty strings vs NaN values
4. State whether round-trip preservation is a design goal

The workaround (`na_filter=False`) is documented but not explicitly connected to the empty string preservation use case.
