Reproduction Results
====================

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULT:
The hypothesis test FAILS as reported. With all values masked, masked_sum returns 0 instead of NA.

DIRECT REPRODUCTION:
Running the provided reproduction code confirms:
- masked_sum with all masked values and min_count=0: Returns 0 (not NA)
- masked_prod with all masked values and min_count=0: Returns 1 (not NA)
- masked_mean with all masked values: Returns NA (as expected per bug report)
- masked_var with all masked values: Returns NA (as expected per bug report)
- masked_std with all masked values: Returns NA (as expected per bug report)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. When min_count=0 (default), check_below_min_count returns False because min_count is not > 0
2. The execution proceeds to use numpy's sum/prod with where=~mask
3. When mask is all True, ~mask is all False, so numpy returns identity elements (0 for sum, 1 for prod)
4. mean/var/std have explicit checks for mask.all() that return NA, bypassing this issue

BEHAVIOR WITH MIN_COUNT:
- With min_count=1, both sum and prod correctly return NA for all-masked arrays
- This is because check_below_min_count returns True when non_nulls (0) < min_count (1)

TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
The bug report is technically accurate:
- The code behaves exactly as described
- The inconsistency between sum/prod and mean/var/std exists
- The proposed fix would make the behavior consistent

NUMPY'S DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR:
NumPy's documentation for the where parameter states that sum returns the additive identity (0) and prod returns the multiplicative identity (1) when no elements are selected. This is mathematically correct behavior for empty sums and products.
