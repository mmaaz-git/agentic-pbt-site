DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS: SparseArray.cumsum

## SparseArray.cumsum Docstring (from source code):

The method docstring states:
- "Cumulative sum of non-NA/null values."
- "When performing the cumulative summation, any non-NA/null values will be skipped."
- "The resulting SparseArray will preserve the locations of NaN values, but the fill value will be `np.nan` regardless."

## Expected Behavior:

1. **NumPy cumsum behavior**:
   - Standard cumulative sum: each element is the sum of all previous elements
   - For [1, 2, 3] should return [1, 3, 6]

2. **SparseArray specific behavior**:
   - Should handle sparse data efficiently
   - Should preserve sparsity where possible
   - The docstring mentions handling NA/null values specially

## Key Observations:

1. **The docstring is somewhat misleading/unclear**:
   - It says "non-NA/null values will be skipped" but this appears to be a typo
   - It should probably say "NA/null values will be skipped"
   - The behavior with non-null fill values is not explicitly documented

2. **Fill value behavior**:
   - The docstring mentions "fill value will be `np.nan` regardless"
   - But this only seems to apply to certain cases
   - The behavior with non-null fill values (like 0) is not documented

3. **Implementation expectations**:
   - The method SHOULD compute cumulative sum
   - It SHOULD NOT crash with infinite recursion
   - The crash is clearly unintended behavior

## Documentation Gaps:

1. No explicit documentation about how cumsum handles integer SparseArrays
2. No mention of the special handling for _null_fill_value cases
3. The public pandas documentation doesn't have a dedicated page for SparseArray.cumsum
4. The behavior difference between null and non-null fill values is undocumented

## Conclusion:

The documentation does not specify that cumsum should fail or recurse infinitely for integer SparseArrays. The method is expected to return a cumulative sum. The infinite recursion is clearly a bug, not intended behavior. The documentation could be clearer about fill_value handling, but the crash is definitely not an expected or documented behavior.
