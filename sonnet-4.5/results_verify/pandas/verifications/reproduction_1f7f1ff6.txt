# Reproduction Analysis

## Summary
I successfully reproduced a variant of the reported bug, though with slightly different behavior than described in the bug report.

## Test Results

### 1. Basic Reproduction Test
When running the exact reproduction code from the bug report using `pandas.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()` and `deregister_matplotlib_converters()`:

**Actual Output:**
```
Initial state:
datetime.datetime in registry: False

First cycle:
After register: True
After deregister: True  # Bug: Should be False

Second cycle:
After register: True
After deregister: True  # Bug: Should be False
```

**Expected Output (per bug report):**
The bug report claimed the first cycle would work correctly (deregister returning to False), but my testing shows it fails from the first cycle itself.

### 2. Hypothesis Tests
When running the property-based tests that import from `pandas.plotting._matplotlib.converter` directly (using `register()` and `deregister()` functions), both tests PASSED. This suggests the issue is specific to how the functions are exposed through the public API.

### 3. Detailed Investigation
The key finding is that the behavior differs depending on the initial state of matplotlib's registry:

- When matplotlib starts with converters already registered (typical case when using the public API), the bug manifests immediately
- When starting with an empty registry (as in the direct converter module test), the functions work correctly

### 4. Root Cause Verification
The bug report correctly identifies the issue with the `_mpl_units` cache persisting across calls. However, in my testing:
- The `_mpl_units` dictionary remains empty throughout all cycles
- The problem appears to be that matplotlib has default converters pre-registered
- When deregister is called, it's not correctly removing pandas converters when matplotlib had pre-existing converters

## Conclusion
The bug is CONFIRMED, though with slightly different behavior than reported. The core issue is that `deregister_matplotlib_converters()` does not properly restore the registry to its original state after `register_matplotlib_converters()` has been called, particularly when matplotlib has pre-existing converters registered.
