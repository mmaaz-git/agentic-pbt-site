## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Reproduction

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. The function `_parse_letter_version` indeed behaves incorrectly when passed integer 0.

#### Test Results:

1. **Integer 0 (BUG CONFIRMED)**:
   - Input: `_parse_letter_version(None, 0)`
   - Expected: `('post', 0)`
   - Actual: `None`
   - **This is the bug - integer 0 is treated as falsy**

2. **String "0" (works correctly)**:
   - Input: `_parse_letter_version(None, "0")`
   - Expected: `('post', 0)`
   - Actual: `('post', 0)`
   - **Works as expected**

3. **Integer 1 (works correctly)**:
   - Input: `_parse_letter_version(None, 1)`
   - Expected: `('post', 1)`
   - Actual: `('post', 1)`
   - **Works as expected**

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug is in line 495 of the implementation:
```python
if not letter and number:
```

This condition uses Python's truthiness evaluation where integer 0 is considered falsy. When `number=0`, the condition evaluates to `False` even though 0 is a valid number.

### Impact on Version Parsing

Interestingly, when parsing actual version strings like "1.0-0", the Version class works correctly:
- `Version("1.0-0")` successfully creates a version object
- `Version("1.0-0").post` returns `0` as expected

This is because the regex parsing always passes strings to `_parse_letter_version`:
- The regex captures "0" as a string from "1.0-0"
- String "0" is truthy in Python, so the bug doesn't manifest

However, the bug would manifest if:
1. The function is called directly with integer 0 (as in the test case)
2. Future code changes cause integers to be passed instead of strings
3. Other code paths in the packaging system use this function with integer inputs

### Type Contract Violation

The function signature explicitly accepts `SupportsInt` (which includes integers), but the implementation doesn't handle integer 0 correctly. This is a violation of the type contract and creates inconsistent behavior between:
- Integer 0 vs String "0"
- Integer 0 vs Integer 1
- The type signature vs the implementation
