DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
The strip_common_indent function in Cython.Build.Inline has NO documentation:
- No docstring
- No inline comments explaining its purpose
- Not mentioned in the official Cython documentation (checked readthedocs.io)

2. USAGE CONTEXT:
The function is used by cython_inline() to normalize indentation in inline Cython code snippets before compilation. Based on code inspection:
- It's meant to strip common leading indentation from multi-line code strings
- It's supposed to preserve the relative indentation between lines
- It's used after strip_string_literals() in the processing pipeline

3. SIMILAR FUNCTION:
I found a DIFFERENT strip_common_indent function in Cython/Compiler/TreeFragment.py with this docstring:
"Strips empty lines and common indentation from the list of strings given in lines"

This suggests the intent is to remove common indentation while preserving code structure.

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Without explicit documentation, the reasonable expectation based on:
- Function name "strip_common_indent"
- Usage in cython_inline for processing Python/Cython code
- Python's syntax requirements

Is that the function should:
- Remove common leading whitespace from all lines
- Preserve the syntactic structure of the code
- Maintain comment markers (#) as they are syntactically significant
- Keep relative indentation between lines

5. COMMENT HANDLING:
There is NO documentation specifying how comments should be handled. However:
- The code explicitly checks for '#' to identify comment lines (line 416 and 422)
- Comments are special-cased in both loops
- This indicates an intent to handle comments specially, though the implementation is buggy

CONCLUSION:
The lack of documentation means we must rely on:
1. The function name and context (processing Python/Cython code)
2. The fact that Python comments are syntactically significant
3. The explicit comment-handling code showing intent to preserve comments
4. Common sense that stripping '#' would break Python syntax

The bug violates reasonable expectations even without explicit documentation.
