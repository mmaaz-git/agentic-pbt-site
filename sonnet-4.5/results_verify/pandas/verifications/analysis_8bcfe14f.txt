## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This bug could be considered invalid if we argue that the current behavior works correctly and produces expected results. The function always receives the correct data because it's only called with "indexes" as the argument. From a purely functional perspective, the code produces correct output.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug is clearly valid because there's an obvious mismatch between the function signature (parameter "inds") and implementation (uses "indexes"). This is objectively incorrect code that violates basic programming principles of function scope and parameter usage. The docstring also documents "inds" as the parameter, confirming this is unintended.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be WONTFIX because: (1) It's in an internal function (prefixed with underscore), (2) It doesn't cause any actual errors or incorrect behavior, (3) It's been working fine for years without issues, (4) The function is only called internally within the same module where the bug doesn't manifest, (5) It's a trivial scope issue that has zero user impact.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even though it doesn't cause runtime errors, this is poor code quality that makes the codebase harder to maintain. Future refactoring could easily break if someone assumes the parameter works as declared. It's also a simple one-line fix that improves code clarity.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue to just update the docstring and parameter name to match the implementation (rename "inds" to "indexes" everywhere). This would make the documentation match the code's actual behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is actually correct - it describes what the function should do. The implementation is wrong, not the documentation. Changing the parameter name to "indexes" would shadow the outer scope variable, which would be even worse design.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't really applicable here, but one could stretch to say "add proper parameter handling" is a new feature to make the function work with different arguments.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature. The function already has a parameter that it's supposed to use but doesn't. Fixing broken code isn't adding a feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a textbook bug - the function declares a parameter "inds" but never uses it, instead accessing "indexes" from outer scope. This violates function encapsulation, makes the code confusing, and could cause issues if the function is ever refactored or called differently. The fix is trivial and obvious.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against calling this a bug is that it doesn't cause any user-visible errors or incorrect behavior. It's an internal implementation detail that happens to work correctly despite being technically wrong.

**Overall consideration**
This is a clear case of incorrect code that violates basic programming principles. A function declares a parameter but completely ignores it, instead using a variable from outer scope. While this doesn't currently cause errors (because the function is always called with the outer variable as its argument), it's misleading, confusing, and fragile. The parameter name in the signature, docstring, and implementation should all match.

However, given that this is in an internal function (underscore-prefixed), has no user impact, and has been working without issues, most maintainers would likely close this as WONTFIX. It's the type of "technically correct but practically irrelevant" bug report that maintainers often reject as not worth the effort to fix, test, and release. While it would be nice to fix for code cleanliness, it provides no actual benefit to users.

The fact that the bug reporter admits "the bug happens to work correctly in the current code" strongly suggests this should be WONTFIX. The reporter even acknowledges it's only problematic for hypothetical future changes. This is exactly the type of pedantic bug report that wastes maintainer time on issues that don't actually matter in practice.
