Bug Reproduction Results for pandas.api.types.is_re_compilable
==============================================================

Testing Environment:
--------------------
- pandas version: 2.2.3 (from installed environment)
- Python version: 3.13
- Test location: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/worker_/54/

Reproduction Results:
---------------------

1. SPECIFIC TEST CASES FROM BUG REPORT:
All the specific test cases mentioned in the bug report were confirmed to crash:

- Input: '?' → EXCEPTION: PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Input: '*' → EXCEPTION: PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Input: '+' → EXCEPTION: PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Input: '(?'→ EXCEPTION: PatternError: unexpected end of pattern at position 2
- Input: '[' → EXCEPTION: PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0

For all these cases, re.compile() also raises re.error with the same messages,
confirming that these are indeed invalid regex patterns.

2. HYPOTHESIS TESTING:
The hypothesis test successfully found multiple failing examples:
- Input: '(' → PatternError: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0
- Input: ')' → PatternError: unbalanced parenthesis at position 0
- Input: '?' → PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0

The test confirms that is_re_compilable raises exceptions instead of returning False
for invalid regex patterns.

3. CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS:
The current implementation in pandas/core/dtypes/inference.py:
```python
def is_re_compilable(obj) -> bool:
    try:
        re.compile(obj)
    except TypeError:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

The function only catches TypeError (for non-string inputs like integers) but does NOT
catch re.error exceptions that occur when a string contains an invalid regex pattern.

4. EXPECTED vs ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
- EXPECTED: is_re_compilable('?') should return False
- ACTUAL: is_re_compilable('?') raises PatternError

The bug report is ACCURATE. The function crashes with PatternError (a subclass of re.error)
when given invalid regex patterns, instead of returning False as documented.

5. VERIFICATION OF PROPOSED FIX:
The proposed fix to catch both TypeError and re.error would correctly handle all cases:
- Invalid regex strings would return False (catching re.error)
- Non-string objects would return False (catching TypeError)
- Valid regex strings would return True

Conclusion:
-----------
The bug report is technically correct. The function does not behave as its documentation
suggests - it should return a boolean for all inputs, but instead raises exceptions for
invalid regex patterns.
