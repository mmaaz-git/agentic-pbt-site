## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in `pandas.arrays.NumpyExtensionArray`.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test fails as reported. When running the test with any list of integers (e.g., `[0]`), the assertion `numpy_ext_arr.dtype == np_arr.dtype` fails with the error message:
   - Error: "AssertionError: Dtype mismatch: int64 != int64"
   - This is confusing because the string representations are identical

2. **Simple Reproduction**: The simpler test case also confirms the issue:
   - `numpy_ext_arr.dtype` is of type `<class 'pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes.NumpyEADtype'>`
   - `np_arr.dtype` is of type `<class 'numpy.dtypes.Int64DType'>`
   - String representations are identical: both show "int64"
   - Equality check returns `False`: `numpy_ext_arr.dtype == np_arr.dtype` → False
   - However, `numpy_ext_arr.dtype.numpy_dtype == np_arr.dtype` → True

### Key Findings

The bug is confirmed. The `NumpyExtensionArray` wraps numpy arrays but returns a `NumpyEADtype` object for its dtype property, which is not equal to the underlying numpy dtype despite:
1. Having identical string representations
2. Having a `.numpy_dtype` attribute that IS equal to the numpy dtype
3. Being documented as "A pandas ExtensionArray for NumPy data"

The equality failure occurs because `NumpyEADtype` inherits from `ExtensionDtype`, whose `__eq__` method only returns True for:
- Other instances of the exact same type with matching metadata
- Strings that can be converted to the same dtype

Since numpy dtypes are neither of these, the equality check fails.
