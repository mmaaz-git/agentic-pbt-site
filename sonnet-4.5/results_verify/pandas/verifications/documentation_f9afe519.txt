## Documentation Analysis for FixedForwardWindowIndexer

After reviewing the official pandas documentation and source code for FixedForwardWindowIndexer, I found:

### Official Documentation
- The pandas API documentation describes FixedForwardWindowIndexer as creating "window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
- The example shows using window_size=2, which creates a forward-looking window from the current row
- The documentation provides a specific example with positive window_size values

### Key Findings:
1. **No explicit documentation about negative window sizes**: Neither the API documentation nor the docstrings explicitly state whether negative window sizes are valid or invalid inputs.

2. **Parameter type hints**: The window_size parameter is typed as `int` in the BaseIndexer.__init__ method, which technically allows negative integers.

3. **No validation in constructor**: The __init__ method inherited from BaseIndexer does not validate the window_size parameter.

4. **No validation in get_window_bounds**: The FixedForwardWindowIndexer.get_window_bounds method does not check for negative window sizes. It only validates:
   - That center is not True (raises ValueError)
   - That closed is not set (raises ValueError)

5. **Implementation details**: The code calculates:
   - `start = np.arange(0, num_values, step, dtype="int64")`
   - `end = start + self.window_size`
   - Then clips end to [0, num_values] if window_size is non-zero

6. **Expected behavior not specified**: The documentation does not specify what should happen with negative window sizes. It neither explicitly allows them nor forbids them.

7. **Related classes**: Other indexer classes like FixedWindowIndexer handle negative values through the clipping operation but don't explicitly validate against negative inputs either.

### Documentation Gap:
The documentation does not specify:
- Whether negative window sizes are valid inputs
- What the expected behavior should be for negative window sizes
- Any invariants about the relationship between start and end bounds

This is a documentation gap where the behavior for negative window sizes is undefined, making it unclear whether the current behavior is a bug or simply unspecified behavior.
