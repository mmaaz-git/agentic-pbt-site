TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for BUG

Why this IS a valid bug:
1. Documentation explicitly states it works "Like in the regular Python `slice` object"
2. Python's slice preserves trailing null characters, numpy.strings.slice strips them
3. This causes silent data corruption - users lose data without warning
4. Behavior is inconsistent with other numpy.strings functions that preserve nulls
5. No documentation warns about this special handling of null characters
6. The behavior violates the principle of least surprise

## Consideration for INVALID

Why this might be invalid:
- Could argue that NumPy string handling has different conventions than Python
- However, the documentation explicitly claims Python-like behavior, so this is weak

## Consideration for WONTFIX

Why this might be wontfix:
- If the underlying C implementation treats nulls as terminators by design
- If fixing would break backward compatibility
- However, this is a data corruption issue, not a trivial edge case

## Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

Why this might be a documentation issue:
- The documentation could be updated to warn about null character handling
- Could add a note that trailing nulls are stripped unlike Python
- However, this would be admitting the function doesn't do what it claims

## Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

Why this might be a feature request:
- Could argue that preserving nulls is a new feature
- However, the documentation already claims this behavior should work

## CONCLUSION

This is clearly a BUG because:

1. **Documentation violation**: The function explicitly claims to work "Like in the regular Python `slice` object" but demonstrably does not

2. **Data corruption**: Silent loss of valid character data without warning or documentation

3. **Inconsistent behavior**: Other numpy.strings functions preserve nulls correctly, creating an inconsistent API

4. **Not an edge case**: Null characters are valid in Python strings and used in real applications (binary data, padding, separators)

5. **Reasonable expectation**: Users have every reason to expect numpy.strings.slice to preserve all characters based on:
   - The explicit documentation claim
   - Python's standard behavior
   - Other numpy.strings functions' behavior

This is not INVALID because the documentation creates a clear contract that is violated.
This is not WONTFIX because it's a significant data corruption issue, not a trivial edge case.
This is not DOCUMENTATION_FIX because the code is wrong relative to the stated behavior.
This is not FEATURE_REQUEST because the documentation already promises this behavior.
