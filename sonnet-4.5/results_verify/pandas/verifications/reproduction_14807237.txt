# Reproduction of Bug Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The pandas ExtensionDtype registry indeed allows the same dtype class to be registered multiple times, causing unbounded growth of the registry.

## Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test ran successfully with 50 examples. For each value of n (1-100), registering the same dtype class n times resulted in the registry growing by exactly n entries. This confirms the bug - the registry grows unboundedly with duplicate registrations.

## Simple Reproduction Results
Running the simple reproduction test showed:
- Initial registry size: 18 (built-in dtypes)
- After first registration: 19 (growth: 1)
- After second registration: 20 (growth: 2)
- After third registration: 21 (growth: 3)

The test confirmed that registering the same MyDtype class three times resulted in three identical entries in the registry. All three entries have the same class object (id: 410495920), confirming they are exact duplicates.

## Code Analysis
Looking at the source code in pandas/core/dtypes/base.py:
1. The `register_extension_dtype` function (line 478) simply calls `_registry.register(cls)`
2. The `Registry.register` method (line 520) unconditionally appends the dtype to the list: `self.dtypes.append(dtype)`
3. There is no check for duplicates before appending

## Impact Verification
The bug has the following confirmed impacts:
1. **Memory growth**: Each duplicate registration adds another entry to the registry list
2. **Silent behavior**: No error or warning is raised when registering duplicates
3. **Potential performance impact**: The `find` method iterates through all dtypes, including duplicates

## Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. The registry allows unbounded duplicate registrations of the same dtype class, which can lead to memory issues and is inconsistent with expected registration system behavior.
