## Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the bug report.

### Hypothesis Test
The Hypothesis test failed exactly as described, with the following error:
- Input: ArrowExtensionArray(pa.array([None])), loc=0, item=0
- Error: pyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: Unsupported cast from int64 to null using function cast_null

### Direct Reproduction
The direct reproduction code also failed with the same error:
```python
arr = ArrowExtensionArray(pa.array([None]))
result = arr.insert(0, 42)
```
Output: ArrowNotImplementedError: Unsupported cast from int64 to null using function cast_null

### Additional Testing
I conducted additional tests to understand the behavior:

1. When creating an array with mixed None and non-None values (e.g., [None, 42]), PyArrow infers the type as int64, not null.
2. When creating an array with only None values, PyArrow creates a null-type array.
3. PyArrow allows casting FROM null to int64 (results in null values in int64 type).
4. PyArrow does NOT allow casting FROM int64 to null type (raises ArrowNotImplementedError).

The error occurs in the insert() method at line 2116 of base.py:
```python
item_arr = type(self)._from_sequence([item], dtype=self.dtype)
```

When self.dtype is null and item is a non-None value, _from_sequence creates an int64 array and then attempts to cast it to null type, which fails.

The bug report accurately describes the issue and the error message matches exactly.
