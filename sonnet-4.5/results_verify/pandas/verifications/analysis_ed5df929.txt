## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None. The bug is clearly reproducible and the error message is objectively incorrect.

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The bug is easily reproducible with the provided test cases
- The error message clearly has swapped variables
- The intent of the error message is obvious from standard programming practices

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The error only occurs when developers pass invalid parameters
- It's an internal validation error that developers would only see during development
- The ValueError is still raised correctly, just with a confusing message

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Error messages are important for developer experience
- The fix is trivial (just swap two variables in the f-string)
- Confusing error messages waste developer time and create frustration
- Even though it's a low-severity bug, it affects the usability of the library

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly specify what the error message should be

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code clearly has a bug - the variables are in the wrong position
- The documentation doesn't need to specify error message formats
- The intent is clear from variable naming and standard practices
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature.

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The feature (parameter validation) already exists
- The error message format is already implemented, just incorrectly
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality

### Considering BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
- The error message displays incorrect information due to swapped variables
- The message says "must be one of foobar" when foobar is the invalid input
- The message shows valid options where it should show the invalid input
- This is clearly unintended behavior that confuses users
- The fix is straightforward and matches the obvious intent
- Standard error message patterns dictate showing valid options first, then the invalid input

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- None. This is unambiguously a bug in the implementation.

### Final Assessment
This is a clear **BUG**. The error message has swapped variables that make it confusing and incorrect. While it's low severity (since the ValueError is still raised correctly), it negatively impacts developer experience and should be fixed. The proposed fix in the bug report is correct and trivial to implement.
