Documentation Analysis
======================

Function Documentation:
-----------------------
The `length_of_indexer()` function in pandas.core.indexers.utils has minimal documentation:

```python
def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
    """
    Return the expected length of target[indexer]

    Returns
    -------
    int
    """
```

Key Points:
-----------

1. **Function Purpose**: The docstring clearly states the function should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]". This is unambiguous - it should match the actual length that would result from the indexing operation.

2. **Return Type**: Specified as `int`, which by convention in Python lengths should be non-negative integers (0 or greater).

3. **Internal vs Public**: This is an internal pandas function (in core.indexers.utils), not part of the public API. However, internal functions still need to behave correctly as they're used throughout pandas.

4. **No Edge Case Documentation**: The documentation does not specify:
   - What to return for empty slices
   - Whether negative values are allowed
   - Special handling for invalid slices

5. **Python Slice Semantics**: While not explicitly documented, the function name and purpose strongly imply it should match Python's built-in slice behavior:
   - Python NEVER returns negative lengths for sequences
   - Empty slices always have length 0
   - This is a fundamental invariant in Python

6. **Testing Coverage**: The existing test suite has minimal coverage:
   - Only tests boolean array indexing
   - No tests for slice edge cases
   - No tests for empty slices

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation, while brief, is clear about the function's purpose: return the expected length of the indexing operation. Since Python's indexing operations never produce negative lengths, and the function promises to return "the expected length", returning -1 for empty slices violates both the documented contract and Python's fundamental semantics for sequence lengths.
