DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Function Documentation

The function `convert_to_line_delimits` has the following documentation:

### Docstring:
"Helper function that converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON."

### Code Comment:
"Determine we have a JSON list to turn to lines otherwise just return the json object, only lists can"

## Documentation Intent

The documentation clearly states the function's purpose:
1. It should convert JSON lists (arrays) to line-delimited JSON format
2. It should return non-list JSON objects unchanged
3. Only JSON lists (starting with '[' and ending with ']') should be converted

## Line-Delimited JSON Format

Line-delimited JSON (also known as NDJSON or JSON Lines) is a format where:
- Each line contains a separate, valid JSON value
- Lines are separated by newline characters
- Commonly used for streaming large datasets

For a JSON array like `[1, 2, 3]`, the line-delimited format would be:
```
1
2
3
```

## Documentation Consistency

The documentation is consistent in its intent:
- The docstring says "converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON"
- The comment says "only lists can" be converted to lines
- The comment explicitly states "otherwise just return the json object"

This clearly indicates that:
- JSON arrays (lists) should be converted to line-delimited format
- Non-arrays should be returned unchanged

## Evaluation

The current implementation violates the documented behavior:
- It incorrectly processes strings like '00' and '{"foo": "bar"}' which are NOT JSON arrays
- These should be returned unchanged according to the documentation
- The bug causes these non-array inputs to be mangled

The documentation is clear and unambiguous about the expected behavior. The implementation does not match the documented intent due to the operator precedence bug.
