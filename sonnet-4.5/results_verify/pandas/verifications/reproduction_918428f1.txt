REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. PROPERTY-BASED TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - The Hypothesis test failed as expected with input [0]
   - Error message: "Different hash keys should produce different hashes for numeric arrays"
   - This confirms that when different hash_key values are provided, they do NOT produce different hashes for numeric arrays

2. SIMPLE EXAMPLE REPRODUCTION:
   - Created array [1, 2, 3] and hashed with two different keys ('0'*16 and '1'*16)
   - Output confirmed:
     * Hash with key '0'*16: [ 6238072747940578789 15839785061582574730  2185194620014831856]
     * Hash with key '1'*16: [ 6238072747940578789 15839785061582574730  2185194620014831856]
     * The hashes are identical despite different hash_key values

3. SOURCE CODE EXAMINATION:
   - Located the hash_array function in pandas/core/util/hashing.py
   - Confirmed the function signature includes hash_key parameter (line 236)
   - Traced execution path for numeric arrays:
     * hash_array calls _hash_ndarray (line 279)
     * _hash_ndarray handles numeric types at lines 301-306:
       - bool: converted to u8
       - datetime64/timedelta64: viewed as i8 then u8
       - numeric types <= 8 bytes: viewed as unsigned then u8
     * After conversion, applies bitwise operations (lines 334-338)
     * hash_key is NEVER used in the numeric path

   - hash_key is only used in two scenarios:
     a) When categorize=True and values are categorized (lines 311-323)
     b) When values have object dtype (lines 326-331)

The bug report is accurate: the hash_key parameter is completely ignored when hashing numeric arrays, despite being a documented parameter that users would reasonably expect to affect the output.
