## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation Status:
The `pandas.compat._optional.get_version()` function is part of a PRIVATE module and has no official public documentation. The underscore in `_optional` indicates this is an internal implementation detail.

### Type Annotations:
The function has explicit type annotations:
- Parameter: `module: types.ModuleType`
- Return type: `-> str`

This clearly declares that the function should return a string.

### Python Convention for __version__:
According to PEP 396 (though withdrawn, still widely followed):
1. The `__version__` attribute's value SHOULD be a string
2. When a module includes a version number, it should be available in the `__version__` attribute as a string

### Key Findings:

1. **No explicit documentation** exists for how `get_version()` should handle non-string `__version__` attributes, as this is a private internal function.

2. **Type annotation contract**: The function explicitly declares `-> str` return type, creating a contract that it will return a string.

3. **Python convention**: While not enforced, the Python community convention (per PEP 396) is that `__version__` should be a string. However, Python does not enforce this at runtime.

4. **Implementation assumption**: The code at line 81 (`version.split()[0]`) clearly assumes `version` is a string, as it calls the `.split()` method.

### Conclusion:
While there's no explicit documentation stating how the function should handle non-string `__version__` attributes, the combination of:
- The explicit `-> str` type annotation
- The code's assumption that `version` is a string (line 81)
- Python conventions that `__version__` should be a string

indicates that the function's current behavior of returning non-string values violates its own type contract and implementation assumptions.
