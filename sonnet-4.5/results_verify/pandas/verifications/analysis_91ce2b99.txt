BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against all possible categories:

1. INVALID (Code works as intended, report is wrong)
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Python officially recognizes "utf_8" as a valid UTF-8 encoding alias
   - The error message says "only supports utf-8 encoding" which implies UTF-8 in general
   - No documentation specifies that only hyphenated versions are accepted
   - The validation logic is clearly incomplete (missing underscore removal)

   Arguments FOR:
   - None - the code clearly has a logic error

2. WONTFIX (Bug is trivial/uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could be considered an edge case since "utf-8" (hyphenated) is the most common form
   - Workaround exists (just use "utf-8" instead of "utf_8")

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Python officially supports "utf_8" as a standard alias
   - Breaks principle of least surprise - users expect Python encoding names to work
   - Fix is trivial (one line change per function)
   - Could affect real users who use "utf_8" convention

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue that supporting all UTF-8 aliases is a new feature

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The error message already claims to support "utf-8 encoding" in general
   - This is fixing inconsistent validation, not adding new functionality
   - The functions already accept encoding parameter, just validate it incorrectly

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong/unclear)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Documentation doesn't mention encoding parameter restrictions at all
   - Could update docs to specify only "utf-8" spelling is accepted

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code behavior is clearly wrong, not the documentation
   - Error messages imply all UTF-8 should work
   - Fixing docs to match broken code would be backwards

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Code rejects valid Python encoding names that Python itself accepts
   - Validation logic has clear oversight (missing underscore handling)
   - Error messages misleadingly say "utf-8" is supported without qualification
   - Inconsistent with Python's encoding normalization
   - Fix is simple and correct (add .replace("_", ""))
   - No documentation justifies the current restrictive behavior

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - None - this is clearly a bug

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a BUG. The code contains a clear logic error where the validation function forgets to normalize underscores when checking UTF-8 encoding names, causing it to reject valid Python encoding aliases like "utf_8". The fix is straightforward and correct.
