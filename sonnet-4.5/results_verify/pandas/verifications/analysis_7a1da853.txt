Bug Report Triage Analysis
===========================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The pandas documentation does specify a maximum precision of 15 digits and defaults to 10. The user is working with extreme edge cases near the maximum float value, which could be considered outside the intended use case. The documentation doesn't promise perfect round-tripping for all possible float values, especially at the boundaries of floating-point representation.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The value 1.7976931345e+308 is a legitimate, finite float value within Python's representable range. Silent data corruption where a finite value becomes infinity is objectively incorrect behavior. The user isn't doing anything wrong or unreasonable - they're just storing a valid float in a DataFrame and expecting it to survive JSON serialization.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an extreme edge case involving floats very close to sys.float_info.max. In practice, such large values are rarely used in data analysis. The issue only affects a tiny range of values near the maximum float. Users can work around it by setting double_precision=15. The bug is actually in the underlying ujson library, not pandas itself.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Data corruption is a serious issue regardless of how rare the edge case is. The workaround (double_precision=15) isn't obvious and users wouldn't know to use it until after encountering data corruption. The default behavior silently corrupts data without any warning or error. Other serialization formats and libraries handle this correctly.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to warn users about potential data corruption for large float values near sys.float_info.max. It could recommend using double_precision=15 for applications that need to handle the full range of float values. The behavior is technically "working as documented" given the 10-digit default precision.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The issue isn't just unclear documentation - it's actual data corruption. Documenting a bug doesn't make it not a bug. Users reasonably expect that finite values remain finite after round-tripping. The problem is in the implementation, not just the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting full float range with perfect round-tripping could be seen as a new feature rather than fixing a bug. The current implementation works for 99.999% of use cases. Adding proper handling for extreme float values could be considered an enhancement. Users could request a "safe_mode" that validates round-trip integrity.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality - it's asking for correct handling of existing Python float values. Basic data integrity during serialization is a fundamental expectation, not a feature. The Python standard library json module already handles this correctly, so it's clearly achievable.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Silent data corruption is occurring - a finite float value becomes infinity after round-tripping. The value is within Python's valid float range (less than sys.float_info.max). No error or warning is raised to alert users to the corruption. The behavior violates the principle of least surprise and basic data integrity. Python's standard json library handles the same value correctly, proving it's possible.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation does specify precision limitations (max 15 digits, default 10). The issue is in an upstream dependency (ujson), not pandas code itself. Extreme edge cases near floating-point limits often have undefined behavior. The workaround of using double_precision=15 does fix the issue.

## Overall Consideration

This case presents a clear instance of data corruption where a valid, finite floating-point value becomes infinity after round-tripping through pandas' JSON serialization. The value 1.7976931345e+308 is legitimately within Python's float range, being less than sys.float_info.max. The corruption happens silently with no errors or warnings, which is particularly problematic for data integrity.

While the documentation does mention precision limitations, it doesn't warn users that valid finite values might become infinity. This isn't just a precision issue where values are slightly off - it's a fundamental change from finite to infinite. The fact that Python's standard json library handles this correctly demonstrates that proper handling is achievable and expected.

The severity of silent data corruption, combined with the fact that this affects valid Python float values and that correct behavior is demonstrated by the standard library, strongly suggests this is a legitimate bug rather than a documentation issue or feature request. Even though it's an edge case, data integrity issues warrant proper fixes rather than just documentation updates.
