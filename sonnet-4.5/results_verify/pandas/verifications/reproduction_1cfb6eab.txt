## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in pandas.io.clipboard.waitForPaste() and waitForNewPaste() functions. The bug report is accurate.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Created a test script to verify the bug using both direct tests and property-based testing
2. Mocked the paste() function to return empty string (for waitForPaste) or constant string (for waitForNewPaste)
3. Tested with various timeout values: 0, -1, 0.001, and random negative values

### Results
All tests confirm the bug:

1. **Direct tests with waitForPaste():**
   - timeout=0: Takes 0.0101s instead of immediate timeout
   - timeout=-1: Takes 0.0101s instead of immediate timeout
   - timeout=0.001: Takes 0.0101s instead of timing out after 0.001s

2. **Tests with waitForNewPaste():**
   - timeout=0: Takes 0.0101s instead of immediate timeout
   - timeout=-1: Takes 0.0101s instead of immediate timeout

3. **Property-based testing:**
   - All tested values between -100 and 0.005 consistently take ~0.0101s to timeout
   - This confirms the bug is systematic, not sporadic

### Root Cause Confirmed
Looking at the source code (lines 694-733 in /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/clipboard/__init__.py):

Both functions follow this pattern:
```python
while True:
    clipboardText = paste()  # or check for new text
    if clipboardText != "":  # or if different
        return clipboardText
    time.sleep(0.01)  # ALWAYS sleeps first

    if timeout is not None and time.time() > startTime + timeout:
        raise PyperclipTimeoutException(...)
```

The bug occurs because:
1. The functions ALWAYS execute time.sleep(0.01) before checking the timeout
2. Even with timeout=0 or negative values, the first sleep happens before any timeout check
3. This guarantees a minimum wait of ~0.01 seconds regardless of timeout value

### Impact
Users who:
- Expect timeout=0 to mean "check once and return immediately"
- Want fine-grained timeout control (e.g., timeout=0.001 for 1ms timeout)
- Use negative timeouts expecting immediate failure

All get unexpected behavior where the function waits at least 10ms.
