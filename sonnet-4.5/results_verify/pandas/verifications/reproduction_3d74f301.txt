REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer BUG
===================================================================

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION - CONFIRMED:
   The specific case mentioned in the bug report is reproduced:
   - Input: slice(None, -1, None) on empty list []
   - Expected (Python's behavior): len([][:-1]) = 0
   - Actual (length_of_indexer): -1

   This is a clear mismatch between the function's output and Python's actual slicing behavior.

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST - MULTIPLE FAILURES:
   The hypothesis test found numerous failing cases, including:
   - slice(1, None, None) on empty list: Expected 0, Got -1
   - slice(None, -1, None) on empty list: Expected 0, Got -1
   - slice(None, -2, None) on empty list: Expected 0, Got -2
   - slice(5, None, None) on empty list: Expected 0, Got -5
   - Very large start values also produce incorrect negative results

3. PATTERN OF FAILURES:
   All failures occur when:
   a) The target is an empty list (len = 0)
   b) The slice has parameters that would be out of bounds

   Specific failing patterns:
   - Negative stop values: slice(None, -N, None) returns -N instead of 0
   - Positive start > 0: slice(N, ..., None) returns negative values
   - Start > stop cases produce negative lengths

4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   Looking at the source code (lines 298-316 of utils.py):

   When stop < 0 and target_len = 0:
   - Line 310: stop += target_len results in stop = -1 + 0 = -1
   - Line 316: return (stop - start + step - 1) // step
   - With start=0, stop=-1, step=1: (-1 - 0 + 1 - 1) // 1 = -1

   Similarly for start > target_len when target_len = 0:
   - Start remains unchanged (e.g., 1)
   - Stop becomes 0 (target_len)
   - Formula: (0 - 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 = -1

5. PYTHON'S CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
   Python's slice.indices() method properly normalizes all these cases:
   - slice(None, -1, None).indices(0) returns (0, 0, 1)
   - slice(1, None, None).indices(0) returns (0, 0, 1)
   - All slices on empty sequences correctly normalize to produce length 0

6. IMPACT:
   The bug affects internal pandas operations that rely on length_of_indexer for:
   - Validating slice assignments (check_setitem_lengths function)
   - Pre-calculating result sizes for optimization

   This could lead to:
   - Incorrect validation errors or missed validation
   - Wrong memory allocation calculations
   - Potential crashes or unexpected behavior in edge cases
