REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the Hypothesis test and the specific failing case confirm the issue.

## Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test failed exactly as described:
- Input: text='0', start=1, stop=0, repl=''
- Expected (Python): '00'
- Actual (Pandas): '0'
- The test correctly identifies that pandas.str.slice_replace does not match Python's string slicing behavior

## Specific Test Case
The specific failing case was reproduced:
- Text: '0'
- start=1, stop=0, repl=''
- Python result: '00' (computed as '0'[:1] + '' + '0'[0:] = '0' + '' + '0')
- Pandas result: '0' (incorrect)

## Additional Testing
I tested multiple cases where start > stop, and ALL of them fail:
1. ('0', 1, 0, ''): Python='00', Pandas='0' ✗
2. ('abc', 2, 1, 'X'): Python='abXbc', Pandas='abXc' ✗
3. ('hello', 3, 2, 'Y'): Python='helYllo', Pandas='helYlo' ✗
4. ('test', 4, 0, 'Z'): Python='testZtest', Pandas='testZ' ✗
5. ('12345', 5, 2, ''): Python='12345345', Pandas='12345' ✗

## Root Cause Verification
Examined the pandas source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/strings/object_array.py` lines 347-364.

The bug is exactly as described in the report:
- When start > stop, x[start:stop] returns an empty string ''
- The code then incorrectly sets local_stop = start (line 353)
- This causes the final concatenation to use the wrong index
- Instead of text[stop:], it uses text[start:], losing the intended suffix

The bug report accurately describes both the problem and its root cause.
