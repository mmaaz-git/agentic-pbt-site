Documentation Analysis for _excel2num Function
==============================================

Function Documentation:
----------------------
The function has clear documentation in its docstring (lines 99-116 in _util.py):
- Purpose: "Convert Excel column name like 'AB' to 0-based column index"
- Input: str - The Excel column name to convert
- Output: int - The column index corresponding to the name
- Raises: ValueError - Part of the Excel column name was invalid

Excel Column Naming Rules:
--------------------------
Based on Excel's official naming conventions:
1. Column names consist ONLY of letters A-Z
2. They follow the pattern: A, B, ..., Z, AA, AB, ..., AZ, BA, ...
3. Whitespace characters are explicitly NOT allowed in column names
4. Empty strings are not valid column names

Function Contract Analysis:
--------------------------
1. The docstring explicitly states the function should raise ValueError for invalid input
2. The example given is 'AB' which contains only letters
3. The error condition states "Part of the Excel column name was invalid"
4. There is no documented special case for empty/whitespace inputs returning -1

Conclusion:
----------
The function behavior is INCORRECT according to its own documentation:
- Whitespace-only strings are NOT valid Excel column names
- Empty strings are NOT valid Excel column names
- The function should raise ValueError for these inputs as stated in the docstring
- Returning -1 for invalid inputs is not documented anywhere
- The current behavior violates the documented contract
