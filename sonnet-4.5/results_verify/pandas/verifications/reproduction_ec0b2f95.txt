## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.io._util._arrow_dtype_mapping. The function contains a duplicate dictionary key that causes one mapping to be silently overwritten.

### Verification Steps Taken

1. **Located the source code**: Found the function at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/_util.py`

2. **Confirmed the duplicate key**: Examined lines 29-46 and confirmed that `pa.string()` appears twice:
   - First occurrence: Line 41 of the file (line 13 within the function)
   - Second occurrence: Line 44 of the file (line 16 within the function)
   - Both map to `pd.StringDtype()`

3. **Ran the Hypothesis test**: The test correctly failed with the message "Expected 14 keys but got 13. Duplicate keys detected in dictionary literal."

4. **Ran the reproduction code**: Confirmed that:
   - The dictionary contains only 13 keys instead of 14
   - The duplicate `pa.string()` key on line 44 overwrites the earlier one on line 41
   - Both entries map to the same value (`pd.StringDtype()`)

### Effect of the Bug

The effect is that the dictionary literal contains 14 entries in the source code, but at runtime only 13 unique keys exist in the resulting dictionary. This happens because Python's dictionary semantics cause the second `pa.string()` entry to overwrite the first one during dictionary construction.

While the practical impact is minimal (since both duplicate entries map to the same value `pd.StringDtype()`), this represents:
1. Dead code that serves no purpose
2. A potential source of confusion for maintainers
3. A violation of the principle of least surprise

The bug report accurately describes the issue and provides correct test code to reproduce it.
