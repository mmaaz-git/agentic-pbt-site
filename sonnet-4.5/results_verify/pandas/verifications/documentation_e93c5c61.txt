Documentation Analysis for pandas.arrays.IntervalArray.overlaps
================================================================

1. Official Documentation (from docstring and online documentation):
   The method's docstring explicitly states:

   "Check elementwise if an Interval overlaps the values in the IntervalArray."

   Parameters section states:
   "other : IntervalArray
       Interval to check against for an overlap."

   This clearly indicates that the parameter `other` should be an IntervalArray type.

2. Documentation Examples:
   Interestingly, all the examples in the documentation show the method being called with a scalar pd.Interval object, NOT an IntervalArray:
   - intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(0.5, 1.5))
   - intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(1, 3, closed='left'))
   - intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(1, 2, closed='right'))

   There are NO examples showing IntervalArray being passed to the method.

3. Source Code Analysis:
   The actual implementation shows:
   ```python
   def overlaps(self, other):
       if isinstance(other, (IntervalArray, ABCIntervalIndex)):
           raise NotImplementedError
       if not isinstance(other, Interval):
           msg = f"`other` must be Interval-like, got {type(other).__name__}"
           raise TypeError(msg)
   ```

   The code explicitly raises NotImplementedError when an IntervalArray is passed, and only accepts scalar Interval objects.

4. Documentation Inconsistency:
   There is a clear contradiction between:
   - The parameter documentation that says "other : IntervalArray"
   - The actual implementation that only accepts scalar Interval objects
   - The examples that only demonstrate usage with scalar Interval objects

5. Method Purpose:
   Based on the implementation and examples, the method performs element-wise comparison between each interval in the IntervalArray and a single Interval object, returning a boolean array indicating overlaps.

Conclusion:
The documentation's parameter specification is incorrect. It states that `other` should be an IntervalArray, but the implementation only supports scalar Interval objects. All provided examples use scalar Intervals, suggesting this is the intended behavior.
