## Documentation Analysis

### Pandas Documentation
- The pandas documentation for `read_clipboard()` and `to_clipboard()` does not specify any platform-specific behaviors
- No mention of WSL-specific handling or CRLF behavior
- The documentation treats clipboard operations as platform-agnostic

### Source Code Comments
The only documentation in the source code is a single comment at line 519:
```python
# WSL appends "\r\n" to the contents.
```
This comment asserts that WSL (PowerShell's Get-Clipboard) always appends CRLF, but provides no reference or justification for this assumption.

### PowerShell Get-Clipboard Documentation
Microsoft's official documentation for Get-Clipboard:
- States it "gets the contents of the clipboard as text"
- Mentions multiline text handling with arrays or raw strings
- Does NOT document that it always appends CRLF to output
- No specification about trailing newlines

### Community Knowledge
Research reveals that PowerShell's newline behavior is:
- Inconsistent across versions (PS 5.1 vs 7.x)
- Platform-dependent (Windows vs WSL)
- Not well-documented by Microsoft
- Known to cause cross-platform issues

### Key Finding
The assumption that "WSL appends '\r\n' to the contents" appears to be:
1. Undocumented by Microsoft
2. Not guaranteed across PowerShell versions
3. An implementation detail rather than a specified behavior

### Documentation Gap
There is no official documentation supporting the code's assumption that Get-Clipboard always appends CRLF. This is an undocumented implementation detail that the pandas code relies upon, making it fragile to changes in PowerShell behavior.
