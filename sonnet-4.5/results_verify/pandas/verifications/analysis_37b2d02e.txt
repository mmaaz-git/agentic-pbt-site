BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating bug report for pandas.io.formats.format.format_percentiles

INVALID Consideration:
-----------------------
Arguments AGAINST INVALID:
- The function documentation clearly states it accepts floats in [0,1]
- Subnormal floats ARE valid floats in [0,1] mathematically
- The validation explicitly checks for [0,1] and passes
- No documentation suggests subnormal floats should be excluded
- The output "nan%" and "inf%" are clearly incorrect percentage representations

Arguments FOR INVALID:
- None. The bug is real and violates documented behavior.

WONTFIX Consideration:
----------------------
Arguments AGAINST WONTFIX:
- This is not an obscure edge case - describe() is a commonly used function
- The bug produces invalid output that could break downstream code
- The fix is straightforward (handle subnormal floats properly)
- Users encountering this would have no way to know it's expected behavior
- The function already handles other edge cases (0% and 100%)

Arguments FOR WONTFIX:
- Subnormal floats (like 5e-324) are extremely rare in practice
- Most users would never encounter this issue
- The values are so small they're effectively zero

Assessment: While subnormal floats are rare, the function should handle ALL valid inputs correctly. The rarity doesn't justify incorrect behavior.

DOCUMENTATION_FIX Consideration:
--------------------------------
Arguments FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- Could update docs to say "excluding subnormal floats"
- Could document that very small values may produce unexpected results

Arguments AGAINST DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The current behavior is clearly wrong (producing "nan%" and "inf%")
- Warnings are generated, indicating unintended behavior
- It's more sensible to fix the code than document broken behavior
- Other pandas functions handle subnormal floats correctly

Assessment: This is a code bug, not a documentation issue.

FEATURE_REQUEST Consideration:
------------------------------
Arguments FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could be seen as requesting support for subnormal floats

Arguments AGAINST FEATURE_REQUEST:
- The function already claims to support floats in [0,1]
- Subnormal floats ARE in [0,1]
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The validation already accepts these values

Assessment: This is not a new feature - it's fixing existing functionality.

BUG Consideration:
-----------------
Arguments FOR BUG:
- Valid inputs (passing validation) produce invalid outputs
- RuntimeWarnings are generated for valid inputs
- Output "nan%" and "inf%" are not valid percentage strings
- The function violates its documented contract
- The issue affects a public API function (describe())
- The fix is straightforward and reasonable
- Other similar values work correctly (e.g., 1e-10 works fine)

Arguments AGAINST BUG:
- Subnormal floats are rare edge cases

Assessment: This is clearly a BUG.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
----------------
This is a valid BUG. The function fails to handle valid inputs correctly, producing invalid output and warnings. While subnormal floats are rare, the function should handle all values in its documented domain [0,1] correctly. The fact that validation passes but execution fails with warnings and invalid output clearly indicates a bug in the implementation.
