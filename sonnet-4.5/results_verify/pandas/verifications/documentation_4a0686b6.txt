## Documentation Analysis

### Official Dataframe Interchange Protocol
The protocol is defined at https://github.com/data-apis/dataframe-api and vendored in pandas.

#### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **Protocol Specification (dataframe_protocol.py, lines 457-465)**:
   - `get_chunks(n_chunks: int | None = None)` returns an iterator yielding chunks
   - When `n_chunks` is provided, it "must be a multiple of self.num_chunks()"
   - The producer must subdivide each chunk before yielding it
   - No explicit requirement that chunks must be non-empty

2. **Implementation Notes**:
   - The protocol doesn't explicitly forbid empty chunks
   - The protocol doesn't specify what should happen when n_chunks > num_rows
   - The comment about n_chunks being "a multiple of self.num_chunks()" doesn't apply here since pandas reports num_chunks=1 by default

3. **Pandas Documentation**:
   - Pandas docs recommend using Arrow C Data Interface instead
   - Severe implementation issues are noted
   - No specific guidance on empty chunks behavior

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation lacks clarity on:
1. Whether empty chunks are acceptable
2. How to handle cases where n_chunks exceeds available data
3. What downstream consumers should expect regarding chunk sizes

### Reasonable Expectations
While not explicitly documented, it's reasonable to expect that:
- Chunks should contain data when possible
- The number of chunks should not exceed the number of rows (when each chunk would have at most 1 row)
- Empty chunks serve no purpose and waste resources
