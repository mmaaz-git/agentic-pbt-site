DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have reviewed all available documentation for pandas.plotting.lag_plot and found:

1. OFFICIAL PANDAS DOCUMENTATION (from pandas.pydata.org)
The documentation states:
- Parameter: "lag : int, default 1" - described as "Lag length of the scatter plot"
- The documentation does NOT explicitly state that lag must be positive
- The documentation does NOT mention what happens with negative or zero lag values
- All examples shown use positive lag values (specifically lag=1)

2. FUNCTION DOCSTRING (from source code)
The docstring matches the online documentation:
- "lag : int, default 1" - "Lag length of the scatter plot"
- No mention of valid ranges or restrictions on the lag parameter
- Example only shows lag=1 usage

3. CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF LAG PLOTS
From a statistical and time series analysis perspective:
- Lag plots are used to visualize autocorrelation in time series data
- They plot y(t) against y(t+k) where k is the lag
- A lag of k means comparing each value with the value k steps ahead
- Mathematically and conceptually, lag plots only make sense for positive lag values
- A lag of 0 would mean plotting a series against itself (all points on diagonal)
- A negative lag has no standard interpretation in time series analysis

4. RELATED FUNCTIONS
Looking at similar functions like autocorrelation_plot:
- These work with the concept of positive lags
- The mathematical formulas assume positive lag values

5. AXIS LABELS
The implementation creates axis labels as:
- X-axis: "y(t)"
- Y-axis: "y(t + {lag})"
- For negative lag, this produces "y(t + -1)" which is confusing notation

CONCLUSION
While the documentation does not explicitly state that lag must be positive, the following strongly suggest this is the intended behavior:
1. The default value is 1 (positive)
2. All examples use positive values
3. The mathematical concept of lag in time series is inherently positive
4. The axis labeling assumes positive lag values
5. The function name and purpose (lag plot) implies positive lag

The documentation could be clearer about this restriction, but the intent seems to be that only positive lag values should be accepted.
