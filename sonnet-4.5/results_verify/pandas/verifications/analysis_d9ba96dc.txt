BUG REPORT ANALYSIS AND CATEGORIZATION
=======================================

Evaluation of each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Code behaves as intended, report is wrong)
   ---------------------------------------------------
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug is clearly reproducible with the provided test cases
   - There is a genuine inconsistency between retbins output and interval boundaries
   - The documentation states retbins returns "the computed bins" which implies the actual bins used
   - The precision parameter is modifying actual numerical values, not just display

   Arguments FOR:
   - None. The inconsistency is real and verifiable.

   Conclusion: NOT INVALID

2. WONTFIX (Bug is trivial/uninteresting)
   ---------------------------------------
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is a significant API inconsistency that affects data analysis
   - Users cannot reliably reconstruct intervals from the returned bins
   - The mismatch can lead to incorrect assumptions about data binning
   - This affects reproducibility when sharing bin edges with others

   Arguments FOR:
   - Users can work around by using higher precision values
   - The issue only manifests with non-default precision values

   Conclusion: NOT WONTFIX - This is a meaningful inconsistency

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The user is not asking for new functionality
   - They expect existing functionality to work consistently
   - The expectation that retbins returns the actual bins used is reasonable

   Arguments FOR:
   - None. This is about existing behavior, not new features.

   Conclusion: NOT A FEATURE REQUEST

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation doesn't match code behavior)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation says precision affects "store and display" which is ambiguous
   - The documentation could be clearer that precision rounds the actual interval values
   - A documentation update could warn users about this behavior

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation says retbins returns "the computed bins" which implies exact values
   - Users reasonably expect interval boundaries to match the bin edges
   - This is more than a documentation issue - it's an API consistency problem
   - Simply documenting this inconsistency doesn't make it correct behavior

   Conclusion: POSSIBLY, but the inconsistency itself is problematic

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   ------------------------------------
   Arguments FOR:
   - Clear inconsistency between retbins output and interval boundaries
   - The precision parameter is modifying actual numerical values, not just display
   - This violates the principle of least surprise
   - The API contract implied by retbins ("returns the bins") is violated
   - Users cannot reliably use the returned bins to reconstruct intervals
   - The behavior is counterintuitive and error-prone

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The current behavior might be intentional for some internal reason
   - Changing it could break existing code that relies on this behavior

   Conclusion: LIKELY A BUG

Final Assessment:
----------------
This is a BUG. The precision parameter should only affect the string representation of intervals, not their actual numerical boundaries. The current behavior creates an inconsistency where the bins returned by retbins=True don't match the actual interval boundaries, violating reasonable user expectations and the implied API contract.
