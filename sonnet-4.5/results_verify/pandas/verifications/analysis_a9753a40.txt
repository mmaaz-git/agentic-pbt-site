TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE A BUG:
   - The code crashes with RecursionError on valid input data
   - SparseArray([1, 0, 2, 0, 3]) is completely valid and uses the default fill_value
   - The infinite recursion is clearly an implementation error (line 1550)
   - The method becomes completely unusable for common use cases (fill_value=0)
   - The crash happens on the default configuration for integer sparse arrays
   - cumsum is a core mathematical operation that should work on all valid arrays
   - The bug prevents basic functionality from working

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE A BUG:
   - None. This is clearly broken functionality.

2. INVALID
   WHY IT MIGHT BE INVALID:
   - (None - the bug is real and reproducible)

   WHY IT'S NOT INVALID:
   - The bug report is accurate in all details
   - The code does crash as described
   - The recursion error is real and reproducible
   - The analysis of the cause is correct

3. WONTFIX
   WHY IT MIGHT BE WONTFIX:
   - (None - this is a critical bug in core functionality)

   WHY IT'S NOT WONTFIX:
   - This affects the default case (integer arrays with fill_value=0)
   - cumsum is a fundamental array operation, not an obscure edge case
   - The bug makes the method completely unusable, not just suboptimal
   - This would affect many real-world use cases of sparse arrays

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   WHY IT MIGHT BE DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly say fill_value=0 should work

   WHY IT'S NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code crashes with RecursionError, which is never acceptable
   - Even if documented as unsupported, it should raise ValueError, not crash
   - The documentation describes cumsum as computing cumulative sums, which
     implies it should work on all valid arrays
   - fill_value=0 is the default for integer sparse arrays, so it must be supported

5. FEATURE_REQUEST
   WHY IT MIGHT BE FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could argue that supporting non-null fill values is a new feature

   WHY IT'S NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - cumsum is already implemented and documented
   - The method exists but crashes due to a bug
   - fill_value=0 is the default, not a special case
   - This is fixing broken code, not adding new functionality

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

The infinite recursion occurs because:
1. Line 1550 attempts to handle non-null fill values by converting to dense
2. But it wraps the dense array back in SparseArray before calling cumsum
3. This creates the same condition (_null_fill_value=False) and loops forever

The suggested fix is correct:
- Change: return SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()
- To: return type(self)(self.to_dense().cumsum())

This would:
1. Convert sparse to dense array
2. Compute cumsum on the dense array
3. Wrap the result back as SparseArray
4. Avoid the recursion

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- HIGH SEVERITY: Crashes on default configuration
- AFFECTS: Core mathematical operation
- IMPACT: Method completely unusable for common cases
- FIX: Simple one-line change

This is unquestionably a BUG that needs to be fixed.
