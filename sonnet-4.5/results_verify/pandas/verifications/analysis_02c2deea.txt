## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be invalid if the MilliSecondLocator was intentionally designed to only return endpoints for some reason, or if there's some other mechanism that's supposed to handle millisecond ticks. Additionally, if the documentation explicitly stated that MilliSecondLocator only returns endpoints, this would be expected behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
This is clearly a typo - using `dmin` twice instead of `dmin` and `dmax` for the start and end of a range. The code structure shows clear intent to create a range from `dmin` to `dmax`, and using the same value for both start and end makes no logical sense. The variable names `st` (start) and `ed` (end) further confirm this is unintentional.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The bug might be considered WONTFIX if millisecond-precision plotting is rarely used in practice, or if there's a workaround available through other matplotlib locators. The code has been this way for some time and may not have caused significant issues for most users.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a clear logic error that completely breaks the functionality of the MilliSecondLocator class. Any user trying to plot time series data with millisecond precision would encounter this bug. It's a one-character fix that restores the intended functionality.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the documentation somewhere stated that MilliSecondLocator only returns two ticks at the endpoints, then the code would be correct and the documentation would need updating. Or if the class was meant to be deprecated or not used directly.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There's no documentation suggesting this behavior is intentional. The code structure clearly shows an attempt to generate a range of dates at millisecond frequency. The bug is in the implementation, not in how it's documented.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
If MilliSecondLocator was never intended to generate multiple ticks and someone is now requesting this functionality, it would be a feature request to add proper millisecond tick generation.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The existing code already attempts to implement this feature - it calculates intervals, creates a date range, and tries to return multiple tick locations. The feature already exists; it's just broken due to a typo.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a textbook bug - a simple typo that breaks functionality. Line 434 uses `dmin` when it should use `dmax`, causing `date_range(start=st, end=ed, ...)` to be called with identical start and end values. This makes it impossible to generate a proper range of millisecond ticks. The variable names (`st` for start, `ed` for end) make the intent crystal clear.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only way this wouldn't be a bug is if the behavior was intentional, but there's no evidence of that. The code structure, variable names, and the try/except block all indicate this was meant to generate multiple ticks.

## Overall Consideration
This is unquestionably a bug. The evidence is overwhelming:

First, the code structure shows clear intent to generate a range of tick marks. Lines 433-435 create variables `st` (start) and `ed` (end) and pass them to `date_range()`. Using the same value for both makes no logical sense and defeats the purpose of having two separate variables.

Second, the bug is a simple typo - using `dmin` twice instead of `dmin` and `dmax`. This is exactly the kind of copy-paste error that commonly occurs in programming. The fix is trivial (changing one variable name) and makes the code work as clearly intended.

Third, the impact is significant - the MilliSecondLocator completely fails to generate appropriate tick marks for millisecond-precision time axes. Instead of multiple ticks at regular intervals, it only returns one tick, making the class useless for its stated purpose. This would affect any user trying to plot high-frequency time series data with matplotlib through pandas.
