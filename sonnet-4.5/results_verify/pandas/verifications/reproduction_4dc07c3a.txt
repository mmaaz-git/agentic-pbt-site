REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR BUG REPORT

## Bug Reproduction - SUCCESSFUL

The bug was successfully reproduced exactly as described in the report.

### Test Results

1. **Specific Failing Input Test**
   - Input: days=4,735,838,584,154,958,556
   - Expected: Should either handle properly or raise an error
   - Actual: Produced negative datetime '-292277022657-01-28T03:24:48'
   - Result as int64: -9223372036854707712 (negative despite positive input)

2. **Boundary Testing**
   - Maximum safe days: 106,751,991,167,300 (approx 292 billion years)
   - With max safe days: Works correctly, produces '292277026596-12-04T00:00:00'
   - With max safe days + 1: Overflows, produces negative datetime '-292277022657-01-27T16:59:44'

3. **Hypothesis Test**
   - Test FAILED as reported
   - Found counterexample: days=5,300,770,121,412,313,574
   - Produced negative result: -9223372036854728448

### Technical Analysis

The overflow occurs exactly as described:
1. Function converts days to uint64 to "avoid overflow" (line 385)
2. Multiplies by 86400 (seconds per day)
3. For days > 106,751,991,167,300, the multiplication result exceeds 2^63-1
4. When cast to datetime64[s], the overflowed value becomes negative

### Code Behavior Verification

The actual code at line 385:
```python
data = (data.astype(np.uint64) * (24 * 60 * 60)).astype("datetime64[s]")
```

This confirms:
- The comment about "converting to uint64 to avoid overflow" is misleading
- The conversion doesn't prevent overflow during multiplication
- The overflow wraps around silently, producing incorrect negative dates

### Conclusion

The bug report is technically accurate:
- The function does silently overflow for large day values
- It produces incorrect negative datetime values instead of raising an error
- The behavior violates the principle of data integrity (silent corruption)
