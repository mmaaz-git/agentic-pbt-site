DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

## numpy.strings.slice Documentation

The official documentation states that numpy.strings.slice should:
- "Slice the strings in `a` by slices specified by `start`, `stop`, `step`"
- Work "Like in the regular Python `slice` object"

Key phrase: "Like in the regular Python `slice` object" - this is an explicit claim that the behavior should match Python's standard slicing.

The documentation provides examples with:
- Basic slicing
- Step slicing
- Negative indices
- Unicode/multi-byte characters (Greek, Chinese, emoji)

However, the documentation does NOT:
- Explicitly mention null character handling
- Specify any exceptions to Python-like behavior
- Warn about any characters being stripped or treated specially

## Python's Standard Behavior

Python strings:
- Treat null characters (\x00) as valid characters
- Preserve ALL characters during slicing operations
- Do not use null as a string terminator (unlike C)
- Include null characters in string length calculations

Testing confirms that Python's slice operation ALWAYS preserves trailing null characters:
- 'abc\x00'[0:4] returns 'abc\x00' (preserves trailing null)
- 'abc\x00def'[0:4] returns 'abc\x00' (preserves null in middle of slice)
- '\x000'[::2] returns '\x00' (preserves null in step slicing)

## Documentation Assessment

The documentation explicitly states the function should behave "Like in the regular Python `slice` object". Since:

1. Python's slice preserves all characters including trailing nulls
2. The numpy documentation claims Python-like behavior
3. No exceptions or special cases are documented

The current behavior of stripping trailing nulls VIOLATES the documented behavior. The documentation creates a reasonable expectation that numpy.strings.slice will preserve all characters just like Python's native slicing does.

The fact that other numpy.strings functions (upper, lower, replace) correctly preserve null characters further reinforces that this is unexpected behavior rather than a documented design choice.
