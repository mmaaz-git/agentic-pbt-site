## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is confirmed and behaves exactly as described.

### Test Results:

1. **Property-based test**: The test fails as expected. When trying to use `pytest.raises` to assert that `opts.pop("xaxis.compat")` raises a ValueError, the test fails with "DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>", meaning the pop() method does not raise any error when removing a default key.

2. **Manual reproduction**: The manual test confirms the inconsistent behavior:
   - `opts.pop("xaxis.compat")` successfully removes the default key without raising any error
   - The removed value (False) is returned
   - The options dictionary becomes empty after the pop operation
   - In contrast, `del opts2["xaxis.compat"]` correctly raises a ValueError with message "Cannot remove default parameter xaxis.compat"

### Observed Behavior:

The _Options class inherits from dict and overrides several methods to protect default keys:
- `__delitem__` is overridden to check if the key is in _DEFAULT_KEYS and raises ValueError if attempting to delete a default key
- `__setitem__`, `__getitem__`, and `__contains__` are overridden to handle key aliasing
- However, `pop()` is NOT overridden and uses the inherited dict.pop() method directly

This creates an inconsistency where:
- Using `del` operator correctly prevents removal of default keys
- Using `pop()` method bypasses this protection and allows removal of default keys

The bug report's description and reproduction code are accurate. The issue is a genuine contract violation where the class invariant (default keys cannot be removed) is not consistently enforced across all removal methods.
