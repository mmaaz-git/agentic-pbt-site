## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation Review

#### _format_argument_list Function
The function's docstring states:
- Purpose: "Convert list of arguments to the string describing those arguments."
- Parameters: Takes a list[str] of allowed arguments (None not allowed)
- Returns: A formatted string for insertion into warning messages
- Examples: Shows how lists are converted to human-readable strings

**Critical Finding**: The docstring does NOT mention that the input list will be mutated. There is no warning about side effects.

#### deprecate_nonkeyword_arguments Decorator
The decorator's docstring states:
- Purpose: "Decorator to deprecate a use of non-keyword arguments of a function."
- allowed_args parameter: "In case of list, it must be the list of names of some first arguments of the decorated functions that are OK to be given as positional arguments."
- No mention of mutation: The documentation does not warn that the allowed_args list will be modified

### Code Implementation Analysis
Looking at line 246-247 in _decorators.py:
```python
if "self" in allow_args:
    allow_args.remove("self")
```
This directly modifies the input list without making a copy first.

### Documentation Gaps
1. The _format_argument_list function documentation does not mention it mutates the input
2. The deprecate_nonkeyword_arguments decorator does not warn users that their allowed_args list will be modified
3. There is no indication this mutation is intentional or expected behavior
4. The mutation happens at runtime (when the decorated function is called), not at decoration time, which is particularly surprising

### Python Best Practices
According to Python conventions:
- Functions should not mutate their arguments unless it's their explicit purpose (like list.sort())
- If mutation is necessary, it should be clearly documented
- Helper/utility functions especially should not have side effects

### Conclusion
The documentation does not indicate that list mutation should occur. This appears to be an implementation detail that leaked out as an unintended side effect. The function's purpose is to format a string, not to modify the input list. Therefore, this is a legitimate bug - the implementation violates both the implicit contract established by the documentation and general Python best practices.
