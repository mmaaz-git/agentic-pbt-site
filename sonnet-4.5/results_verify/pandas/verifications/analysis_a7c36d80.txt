## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Produces incorrect output**: The function generates meaningless plots with negative lag values
2. **Violates mathematical definition**: Lag plots have a well-defined mathematical meaning that requires positive lags
3. **Silent failure**: Function accepts invalid input without warning, producing garbage output
4. **Misleading visualization**: Creates plots that appear to work but are statistically meaningless
5. **Confusing axis labels**: "y(t + -1)" is mathematically confusing and incorrect

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit negative values (but this is weak - many functions don't document all invalid inputs)

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. Edge case that users are unlikely to encounter (who would use negative lag?)
2. Python's slicing behavior is technically working as designed

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - negative numbers are common user errors
2. The function produces completely incorrect output, not just slightly wrong
3. Easy to fix with simple validation
4. Accepting invalid inputs that produce nonsense is not acceptable

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. Documentation doesn't explicitly say negative lags are prohibited
2. Function technically "works" (doesn't crash)

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
1. Mathematical definition of lag plots requires positive lags
2. Function produces meaningless output - this is objectively wrong behavior
3. Default value and examples all use positive values, indicating expected usage
4. "Not explicitly documented as invalid" is not sufficient reason to accept nonsense inputs

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Documentation could be clearer about valid lag values
2. Could argue the code works as designed but docs need updating

**Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code behavior is fundamentally wrong, not just poorly documented
2. Accepting negative lags produces mathematically meaningless results
3. This is a code bug that needs fixing, not a documentation issue
4. No reasonable interpretation of "lag plot" would support negative lags

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could argue that validation is a "new feature"

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. Input validation for mathematical functions is not a feature, it's a requirement
3. The function already exists - it just needs to work correctly

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Mathematically incorrect**: Lag plots have a well-defined statistical meaning that requires positive lag values. Negative lags violate the fundamental concept.

2. **Produces garbage output**: With lag=-1, it plots only the first point against the last point. This is not a lag plot in any meaningful sense.

3. **Silent failure is dangerous**: Users may not immediately realize the plot is meaningless, leading to incorrect analysis.

4. **Easy to make this mistake**: Users might accidentally pass negative values (e.g., from calculations) and get nonsense results.

5. **Standard practice**: Statistical functions should validate inputs to ensure they make mathematical sense. Other pandas functions do validate parameters.

6. **Fix is trivial**: Adding a simple `if lag <= 0: raise ValueError()` check would prevent this issue.

The fact that the documentation doesn't explicitly prohibit negative values is irrelevant - many invalid inputs aren't explicitly documented as such. The function should enforce the mathematical constraints of the operation it implements.
