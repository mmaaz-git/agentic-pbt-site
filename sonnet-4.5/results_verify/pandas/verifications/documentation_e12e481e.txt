## Documentation Analysis

### Module Purpose
The `numpy.f2py.symbolic` module is part of the F2PY (Fortran to Python interface generator) utility. Based on the source code comments and documentation:

1. **Purpose**: The module implements a minimal symbolic engine for parsing Fortran/C expressions into a tree of expression instances. It's specifically designed to analyze Fortran expressions to solve dimension specifications.

2. **String Concatenation**: The code explicitly documents that in Fortran, `//` is a concatenate operation for string operands (different from Python's floor division). This is implemented via the `__floordiv__` operator which creates a `CONCAT` expression.

### Normalize Function Documentation
The `normalize` function has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Normalize Expr and apply basic evaluation methods."
- No specification about what "normalize" means precisely
- No explicit contract about associativity or canonical forms

### Analysis of Expected Behavior

1. **What normalize does**: Based on the implementation (lines 899-916), it:
   - Merges adjacent STRING expressions with matching quote types
   - Returns a simplified CONCAT expression or single string if possible
   - Does NOT flatten nested CONCAT expressions

2. **Mathematical Properties**: While string concatenation is mathematically associative, the documentation does not explicitly state that `normalize` must preserve or enforce associative equivalence. However:
   - The purpose of a "normalize" function typically implies creating a canonical form
   - Two equivalent expressions should normalize to the same result
   - The current implementation fails this expectation for nested concatenations

3. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - No specification of what constitutes a "normalized" form
   - No mention of how nested operations should be handled
   - No explicit contract about mathematical properties like associativity

### Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly specify that `normalize` must handle associativity correctly, but the name and purpose of the function strongly imply it should produce canonical forms for equivalent expressions. The lack of explicit documentation about this behavior means this could be considered either a bug or a documentation issue.
