## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The provided Hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue. When running the test with arbitrary integers, it fails when it encounters integers outside the int64 range (like -9,223,372,036,854,775,809 which is below int64 minimum of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808).

Test output:
- The DataFrame is created successfully with object dtype
- The __dataframe__() call succeeds
- The from_dataframe() call fails with: "NotImplementedError: Non-string object dtypes are not supported yet"

### Manual Example Reproduction
The manual reproduction code also confirms the bug:
- DataFrame with value -9,223,372,036,854,775,809 creates successfully
- DataFrame dtype is confirmed as 'object'
- Value is confirmed to be below int64 minimum
- __dataframe__() succeeds without error
- from_dataframe() fails with the same NotImplementedError

### Source Code Analysis
By examining the pandas source code, I found the exact location of the error:
- File: pandas/core/interchange/column.py, line 144
- The dtype property checks if an object dtype column contains strings
- If infer_dtype(self._col) returns "integer" (instead of "string" or "empty"), it raises NotImplementedError

### Key Issue Confirmed
The bug report is accurate in its description:
1. Python integers outside int64 range are stored as object dtype by pandas
2. __dataframe__() creates an interchange object without validation
3. The error only occurs when from_dataframe() tries to use the interchange object
4. This violates the fail-fast principle - the error should occur during __dataframe__() if the data type is unsupported

The behavior exactly matches what the bug report describes.
