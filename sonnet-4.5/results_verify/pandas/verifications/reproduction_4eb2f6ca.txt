## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Claim Verification
The bug report is **technically accurate** in its claims:

1. **The function does change string length for ß character**: Confirmed
   - Input: 'ß' (length 1)
   - Output: 'SS' (length 2)

2. **The property `result[1:] == s[1:]` is violated**: Confirmed
   - For input 'ß': result[1:] = 'S' while s[1:] = ''
   - This breaks the implicit assumption that the rest of the string remains unchanged

3. **The Hypothesis tests fail as described**: Confirmed
   - `test_rest_unchanged` fails for 'ß'
   - `test_first_char_uppercase` fails because result[0] = 'S' but s[0].upper() = 'SS'

### Unicode Behavior Analysis
The issue stems from standard Unicode behavior:
- German ß (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S, U+00DF) uppercases to 'SS' (two characters)
- This is correct per Unicode standards
- Python's `str.upper()` correctly implements this Unicode rule
- Python's `str.capitalize()` also handles this, returning 'Ss' for 'ß'

### Function Implementation Issue
The function `capitalize_first_letter(s)` uses `s[:1].upper() + s[1:]`:
- Takes first character as a substring: 'ß'
- Uppercases it: 'ß'.upper() = 'SS'
- Concatenates with rest: 'SS' + '' = 'SS'
- This changes the string structure unexpectedly

### Actual Usage Context
The function is only used in `PeriodDtype.__eq__` for comparing strings like:
- "period[D]" vs "Period[D]"
- These are controlled ASCII strings that never contain Unicode characters like ß
- The actual use case is unaffected by this Unicode issue

### Technical Assessment
The bug exists as described - the function does not handle Unicode case-changing characters that expand when uppercased. However, this only affects theoretical usage with Unicode strings, not the actual internal usage within pandas where it only processes ASCII strings.
