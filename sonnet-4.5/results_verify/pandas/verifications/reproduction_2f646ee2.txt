## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report is PARTIALLY ACCURATE but contains a minor error in the reported failing input value.

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report successfully identifies an OverflowError, but the exact failing value is slightly different:
- Bug report claims: `days=2936549.0` causes overflow
- Actual result: `days=2936549.0` WORKS and returns `9999-12-31 00:00:00`
- True boundary: `days=2936550.0` and higher cause OverflowError

### Direct Reproduction
Testing the direct example from the bug report:
```python
from pandas.io.sas.sas7bdat import _parse_datetime
days = 2936549.0
result = _parse_datetime(days, 'd')
```

Result: **No error** - Successfully returns `datetime(9999, 12, 31, 0, 0, 0)`

### Boundary Analysis
The exact boundary for OverflowError is:
- Maximum working value: 2936549.999999... days (up to 9999-12-31 23:59:59)
- First failing value: 2936550.0 days (would be 10000-01-01)
- Python datetime.max.year is 9999

The calculation is correct in the bug report:
- 2936549 days from 1960-01-01 = 9999-12-31
- 2936550 days from 1960-01-01 = 10000-01-01 (overflow)

### Error Behavior Confirmed
The function does raise `OverflowError: date value out of range` when given values that would result in dates beyond year 9999. This behavior is confirmed for:
- Any value >= 2936550.0 days
- Equivalent seconds values that exceed the datetime range

### Property Test Issue
The property test's monotonicity assertion is valid - when comparing two consecutive day values where the larger one causes an overflow, the test will fail because the function crashes instead of handling the overflow gracefully.

### Conclusion
The bug EXISTS as described - the function crashes with OverflowError for large date values instead of handling them gracefully. The only minor inaccuracy is the exact boundary value (off by 1 day in the report).
