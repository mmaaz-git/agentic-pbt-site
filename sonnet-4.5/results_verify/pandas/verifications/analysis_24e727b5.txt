TRIAGE ANALYSIS: pandas.plotting.bootstrap_plot Bug Report

Considering each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed):
   STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
   - The documentation explicitly states "random sampling with replacement"
   - The implementation uses random.sample() which samples WITHOUT replacement
   - This is a fundamental statistical error - bootstrapping REQUIRES replacement
   - The bug produces completely incorrect statistical estimates (variance = 0)
   - The function fails its primary purpose of uncertainty estimation
   - The fix is simple and correct: change random.sample() to random.choices()

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - None. This is a clear implementation error.

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. The report is technically accurate.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The report correctly identifies that random.sample() samples without replacement
   - The documentation confirms bootstrapping needs sampling with replacement
   - All tests confirm the bug exists

3. WONTFIX (Bug is trivial/uninteresting):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. This is not trivial.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - This completely breaks the statistical validity of the function
   - Users relying on this for statistical analysis get wrong results
   - This affects scientific/financial analysis where accuracy is critical
   - The bug makes the function statistically useless

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. The documentation already promises this functionality.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The documentation explicitly states the function uses "sampling with replacement"
   - This is not a new feature but a fix to match documented behavior
   - Bootstrap by definition requires sampling with replacement

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Theoretically, we could change docs to say "without replacement"

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - That would make the function NOT a bootstrap plot
   - The function name is "bootstrap_plot" which has a specific statistical meaning
   - Wikipedia and all statistical literature define bootstrap as WITH replacement
   - Changing the docs would be admitting the function is misnamed
   - The correct fix is to change the implementation, not the documentation

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- HIGH SEVERITY: This produces statistically incorrect results
- Silent failure: Users get wrong estimates without knowing
- Affects data science/statistical analysis workflows
- Simple fix available that corrects the behavior

RECOMMENDATION:
This is unquestionably a BUG that must be fixed. The implementation directly
contradicts both the documentation and the fundamental definition of bootstrapping.
The suggested fix (random.sample â†’ random.choices) is correct and necessary.
