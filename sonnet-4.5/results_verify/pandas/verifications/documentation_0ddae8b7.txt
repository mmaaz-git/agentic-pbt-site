## Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer

### Function Documentation
The function `length_of_indexer` is an internal utility function in pandas located in `pandas/core/indexers/utils.py`. The documentation is minimal:

**Docstring:** "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
**Parameters:**
- `indexer`: The indexing object (slice, array, list, etc.)
- `target`: Optional target sequence/array to apply the indexer to
**Returns:** int - the expected length

### Key Observations:
1. **This is an internal utility function** - It's not part of the public pandas API and has no official documentation in the pandas user guide or API reference.

2. **The documentation is sparse** - The docstring only states it returns "the expected length of target[indexer]" without specifying:
   - How it handles negative step slices
   - What the "expected" behavior should be for edge cases
   - Whether it should match Python's built-in slice behavior

3. **No specification of slice behavior** - The documentation does not explicitly state that the function should return the same length as `len(target[indexer])` for all valid slice objects. However, the function name and description strongly imply this should be the case.

4. **Purpose appears to be length calculation** - Given the function name "length_of_indexer" and the docstring stating it returns "the expected length", it's reasonable to expect that for a slice object, it should return the same value as `len(target[slice_object])`.

5. **No mention of limitations** - The documentation doesn't mention any known limitations or cases where the function might not work correctly with certain slice parameters.

### Conclusion:
While the documentation is minimal, the function's purpose is clear from its name and docstring: to return the length that would result from applying an indexer to a target. For slices, this should match Python's standard slice behavior, including proper handling of negative steps.
