REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT: pandas.plotting.bootstrap_plot

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. CODE VERIFICATION:
   - Located the implementation in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/misc.py
   - Line 303 confirms: samplings = [random.sample(data, size) for _ in range(samples)]
   - This indeed uses random.sample() which samples WITHOUT replacement

2. REPRODUCTION TEST RESULTS:
   - Ran the provided reproduction code - it works exactly as described
   - random.sample() NEVER produces duplicates in any sample (0/1000 samples had duplicates)
   - random.choices() produces duplicates in ~95% of samples (as expected for bootstrap)

3. STATISTICAL VERIFICATION:
   - For a 5-element dataset sampled with size=5:
     * WITHOUT replacement (current): P(duplicates) = 0% (impossible)
     * WITH replacement (correct): P(duplicates) â‰ˆ 96.2%

4. VARIANCE ESTIMATION IMPACT:
   - The bug has severe statistical implications
   - Bootstrap variance of mean with current implementation: 0.0000 (wrong!)
   - Bootstrap variance of mean with correct implementation: 0.3688 (closer to theoretical)
   - The current implementation gives 0 variance because every sample is just a permutation
     with the exact same mean

5. PROPERTY-BASED TEST:
   - The hypothesis test confirms random.sample() never produces duplicates
   - This violates the core requirement of bootstrap sampling

CONCLUSION: The bug is REAL and SEVERE. The function is fundamentally broken for its
intended statistical purpose. Every bootstrap sample is just a permutation of the original
data, which completely defeats the purpose of bootstrapping.
