## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `_trim_zeros_complex` function has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Separates the real and imaginary parts from the complex number, and executes the _trim_zeros_float method on each of those."
- This is a private/internal function (starts with underscore)
- No public API documentation exists for this function

### Function Purpose
Based on code analysis and usage context:
1. The function is used internally by pandas formatting code when `fixed_width=True`
2. It's called from FloatArrayFormatter when formatting complex numbers for display
3. Purpose: Trim trailing zeros from complex number string representations while maintaining alignment

### Expected Behavior
From the code comment in the function:
```python
# Complex numbers are represented as "(-)xxx(+/-)xxxj"
```

This comment indicates the function expects to handle complex numbers in their standard Python string representation format, which includes parentheses when both real and imaginary parts are present.

### Python Language Specification
Python's official documentation for complex numbers (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex):
- Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part
- String representation follows the format: `(real+imagj)` when real part is non-zero
- Parentheses are part of the standard representation to ensure unambiguous parsing

### Implicit Contract
While not explicitly documented, the function name `_trim_zeros_complex` and its usage context strongly imply it should:
1. Accept complex number string representations as input
2. Trim trailing zeros from the numeric parts
3. **Preserve the structural format of the complex number representation**
4. Return properly formatted complex number strings

The function is violating this implicit contract by not preserving the complete structure of the input format (losing the closing parenthesis).

### Conclusion
The lack of explicit documentation doesn't excuse the incorrect behavior. The function has a clear purpose implied by its name and usage - to trim zeros while preserving the valid complex number format. Python's standard complex number representation with parentheses is well-established, and any function processing these strings should maintain their structural integrity.
