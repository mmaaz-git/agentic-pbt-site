DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. PANDAS UJSON DOCUMENTATION:
- No official pandas documentation explicitly describes ujson_loads integer limits
- pandas uses ujson as the default JSON parsing engine for performance
- Known issues exist in pandas GitHub repository regarding ujson integer overflow

2. UJSON LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION:
From GitHub issues and PyPI:
- ujson is intended as a fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python
- Known limitations with large integers have been acknowledged by maintainers
- Previous fix attempts added ValueError for out-of-range values, but didn't address all cases

3. JSON SPECIFICATION (RFC 7159):
Section 6 on Numbers states:
- JSON itself places no limits on number magnitude or precision
- Implementations MAY set limits on range and precision
- Good interoperability achieved with IEEE 754-2008 binary64 (double precision)
- Integers in range [-(2^53)+1, (2^53)-1] are interoperable
- Numbers outside this range "may indicate potential interoperability problems"

Key quote: "Note that when such software is used, numbers that are integers and are in the range [-(2^53)+1, (2^53)-1] are interoperable in the sense that implementations will agree exactly on their numeric values."

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Based on JSON spec and Python conventions:
- JSON parsers should either:
  a) Correctly parse all valid JSON numbers (like stdlib json), OR
  b) Raise clear errors for unsupported values
- Silent data corruption is NEVER acceptable behavior

5. COMPARISON WITH PYTHON'S JSON MODULE:
- Python's json module correctly handles arbitrary precision integers
- This is the expected behavior for Python JSON libraries
- ujson trades correctness for speed, but should still fail safely

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly state that ujson will silently corrupt data at -2^64. While the JSON spec allows implementations to have limits, it does not permit silent data corruption. The behavior violates the principle of failing safely when encountering unsupported values.
