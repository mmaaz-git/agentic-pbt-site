## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Arguments For:**
1. The function violates a fundamental Python invariant: `len()` always returns non-negative integers
2. The function's name and docstring clearly indicate it should return "the expected length of target[indexer]"
3. When you actually compute `len(target[indexer])` in Python, it never returns negative values
4. The function is used in validation contexts where negative values are nonsensical (e.g., comparing against `len(value)`)
5. The bug causes actual incorrect behavior - negative lengths are mathematically and semantically invalid

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state "non-negative" requirement
- It's an internal API function (pandas.core.indexers)

**Verdict:** This is a VALID BUG. The semantic meaning of "length" universally implies non-negative values.

### Considering INVALID (Incorrect Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise non-negative values
- It's an internal function that might have different semantics

**Arguments Against:**
- The function name contains "length" which has clear semantic meaning
- The docstring says "expected length of target[indexer]" which directly contradicts returning negative values
- Python's `len()` never returns negative values, setting clear expectations

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID. The bug report correctly identifies a semantic violation.

### Considering WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Arguments For:**
- It's an internal API function, not public-facing
- Edge cases like `slice(1, 0, 1)` are unusual

**Arguments Against:**
- The function is used in actual validation logic that affects user-facing behavior
- The bug can cause confusing error messages or incorrect validation
- Fixing it is straightforward and improves correctness

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX. This affects correctness of internal validation logic.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be viewed as requesting new validation behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- The function already claims to return "length" which has established meaning
- This isn't adding new functionality, it's fixing incorrect behavior
- The expected behavior (non-negative lengths) is standard in Python

**Verdict:** NOT A FEATURE REQUEST. This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding features.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation could be clearer about return values
- Could document that negative values are possible

**Arguments Against:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- Documenting "length can be negative" would be semantically incorrect
- The fix should be in the code to match the documented intent

**Verdict:** NOT A DOCUMENTATION FIX. The code should be fixed to match the semantic meaning of "length".

### Final Analysis
This is clearly a BUG. The function `length_of_indexer` returns negative values when it should return the length of a slice operation, which by definition must be non-negative. The semantic meaning of "length" in programming universally implies a non-negative count. The function's behavior contradicts both its name and its documented purpose.
