TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG - Arguments for:
   - The function names strongly imply a mathematical inverse relationship
   - Most frequency pairs DO maintain the inverse property (as demonstrated)
   - The asymmetry between D and B is inconsistent with how other frequencies work
   - Users would reasonably expect is_subperiod and is_superperiod to be inverses
   - The inconsistency could lead to subtle bugs in user code

   Arguments against:
   - The documentation describes these as resampling possibility checkers, not mathematical period relationships
   - The actual behavior makes sense from a data conversion perspective
   - The functions work as documented (checking if downsampling/upsampling is possible)

2. INVALID - Arguments for:
   - The functions behave exactly as documented (checking resampling possibility)
   - The docstrings never claim these should be inverse functions
   - The behavior is logically correct for frequency conversion operations
   - Day→BusinessDay downsampling would lose weekend data (correctly returns False)
   - BusinessDay→Day upsampling can fill weekends (correctly returns True)

   Arguments against:
   - The function names are misleading and imply mathematical relationships
   - The inconsistency is surprising and counterintuitive
   - Other frequency pairs maintain the expected inverse relationship

3. WONTFIX - Arguments for:
   - The current behavior is technically correct for resampling operations
   - Changing it would break existing code that relies on this behavior
   - The issue only affects the D/B frequency pair
   - It's an edge case that rarely impacts real-world usage

   Arguments against:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - Day and BusinessDay are common frequencies
   - The inconsistency violates principle of least surprise
   - The naming creates reasonable expectations that aren't met

4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments for:
   - Could request new functions with clearer names (can_downsample/can_upsample)
   - Could request consistent inverse behavior as a new feature
   - The current implementation works, but enhancement would improve usability

   Arguments against:
   - This is about fixing existing behavior, not adding new functionality
   - The functions already exist and are widely used

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments for:
   - The function names are misleading compared to their actual purpose
   - Documentation could clarify that these are NOT mathematical inverses
   - Could explicitly document the D/B asymmetry
   - Could rename functions to better reflect their purpose (can_downsample/can_upsample)

   Arguments against:
   - The documentation accurately describes what the functions do
   - The issue is with the implementation inconsistency, not documentation

DETAILED REASONING:
-------------------
The core issue is a mismatch between:
1. Function names that imply mathematical period relationships (subperiod/superperiod)
2. Actual implementation that checks resampling feasibility
3. User expectations based on the names

The D/B asymmetry makes logical sense for data operations:
- BusinessDay → Day: Can fill in weekends (upsampling works)
- Day → BusinessDay: Would lose weekend data (downsampling doesn't work)

However, this creates an inconsistency where:
- is_subperiod('D', 'B') = False (Day cannot downsample to BusinessDay)
- is_superperiod('B', 'D') = True (BusinessDay can upsample to Day)

This violates the mathematical expectation that subperiod and superperiod are inverses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
The functions work as documented (checking resampling possibility) but have misleading names that create false expectations. The best resolution would be a DOCUMENTATION_FIX to:
1. Clarify that these are NOT mathematical inverse functions
2. Explicitly document the D/B asymmetry
3. Consider deprecating in favor of better-named functions
