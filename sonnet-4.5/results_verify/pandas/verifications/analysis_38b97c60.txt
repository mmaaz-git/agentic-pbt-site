## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The invariant that start <= end is fundamental to the concept of a window/range
- The bug produces mathematically nonsensical bounds where start > end
- Python's slicing convention [start:end) assumes start <= end for meaningful results
- While array[1:0] returns an empty array, it's semantically incorrect to have a window that "starts after it ends"
- Other window indexers in pandas (ExpandingIndexer, FixedForwardWindowIndexer) maintain this invariant
- The bug occurs due to unintended interaction between window_size=0 triggering centering logic and closed='neither'

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code technically doesn't crash - array[1:0] returns an empty array
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state the start <= end invariant
- Window_size=0 is an edge case that might not have been fully considered

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly specify that start must be <= end
- The slicing operation array[start:end] still works (returns empty array)
- window_size=0 is an unusual input that might be considered outside normal usage

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The invariant start <= end is implicit in the concept of window bounds
- Just because something doesn't crash doesn't mean it's correct
- The behavior is clearly unintended (the centering logic shouldn't apply to window_size=0)

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- window_size=0 is an obscure edge case unlikely in practice
- The current behavior doesn't cause crashes, just returns empty windows
- Users probably shouldn't use window_size=0 anyway

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is simple and improves correctness
- Even edge cases should behave correctly
- The issue affects a public API that users might reasonably call with window_size=0

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be clearer about the start <= end invariant
- Edge case behavior for window_size=0 is not documented
- Could document that window_size=0 may produce invalid bounds

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is a logic bug in the code, not a documentation issue
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
- The expected behavior (start <= end) is obvious from context

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as a request to handle window_size=0 edge case better
- The current code doesn't explicitly support window_size=0

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already accepts window_size=0, it just handles it incorrectly
- The invariant violation is a bug, not a missing feature

### Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The code violates a fundamental invariant of window bounds (start <= end). While this invariant isn't explicitly documented, it's inherent to the concept of a window or range. The fact that Python's slicing handles start > end gracefully by returning an empty array doesn't make the bounds correct - they're semantically invalid.

The bug arises from an unintended interaction where window_size=0 triggers the centering offset calculation (line 105: `if center or self.window_size == 0`), which was likely meant to handle only the center=True case. This, combined with closed='neither', produces invalid bounds.

The proposed fix is reasonable: either don't apply centering logic when window_size=0, or ensure the final bounds maintain the start <= end invariant.
