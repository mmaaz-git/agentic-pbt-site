## Documentation Analysis

### Public API Documentation
1. The functions `_parse_datetime` and `_convert_datetimes` are **internal functions** (prefixed with underscore), not part of pandas' public API
2. No public documentation exists for these internal functions
3. The public `pandas.read_sas()` function documentation does not specify how datetime precision is handled

### SAS Format Standards (from external sources)
Based on SAS documentation and standards:

1. **SAS Date Values**: Stored as number of days since January 1, 1960
   - Can be fractional (e.g., 0.5 = noon on January 1, 1960)
   - Floating-point representation supports fractional days

2. **SAS Datetime Values**: Stored as number of seconds since January 1, 1960
   - Supports fractional seconds with up to microsecond precision
   - Uses 8-byte floating-point for maximum precision

3. **Precision Requirements**:
   - SAS supports fractional components in both date and datetime values
   - Maximum precision limited by 15-digit floating-point representation
   - Industry standard is to preserve fractional components when converting

### Function Docstrings

From the source code examination:

`_parse_datetime` (lines 67-78):
- No docstring, but code clearly preserves fractional components
- Uses `timedelta(days=sas_datetime)` which accepts floats

`_convert_datetimes` (lines 81-108):
- Docstring states: "Convert to Timestamp if possible, otherwise to datetime.datetime"
- Notes: "SAS float64 lacks precision for more than ms resolution"
- **Does NOT mention truncation of fractional days**
- Parameter documentation says unit 'd' is for "dates" but doesn't specify precision handling

### Key Finding
The docstring for `_convert_datetimes` acknowledges that SAS uses float64 and mentions millisecond resolution, but:
1. Does not document that fractional days will be truncated when unit='d'
2. Does not warn users about potential data loss
3. Creates an inconsistency with `_parse_datetime` which is not documented

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify that fractional days should be truncated. The behavior appears to be an implementation oversight rather than intentional design, as:
1. SAS standard supports fractional days
2. The sister function `_parse_datetime` preserves them
3. No documentation warns about truncation
4. The 's' (seconds) path in the same function preserves fractional components
