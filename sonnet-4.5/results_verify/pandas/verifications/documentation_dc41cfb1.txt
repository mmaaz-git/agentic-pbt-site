=== DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS ===

1. PANDAS ROLLING.VAR() DOCUMENTATION:
According to the official pandas documentation:
- Purpose: Calculate the rolling variance across a specified window
- Formula: (sum of squared deviations) / (N - ddof)
- Default ddof: 1 (for unbiased sample variance)
- Return type: Series/DataFrame with np.float64 dtype
- NO mention of numerical stability issues
- NO warnings about potential negative values
- NO caveats about precision with extreme values

2. MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION OF VARIANCE:
From mathematical references and statistics literature:
- Variance is defined as: Var(X) = E[(X - μ)²]
- For a sample: Var = Σ(xi - mean)² / (n - ddof)
- FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY: Variance is ALWAYS non-negative
- Mathematical proof: Since (X - μ)² ≥ 0 for all X, and expectation/average of non-negative values must be non-negative
- Zero variance only occurs when all values are identical (constant)
- Negative variance is mathematically impossible and indicates calculation error

3. IMPLICATIONS OF NON-NEGATIVITY:
From statistical theory:
- Non-negativity is a fundamental axiom, not just a convention
- Any negative variance indicates:
  * Computational error
  * Numerical instability
  * Implementation bug
- Used to validate statistical models and calculations
- Essential for interpreting data variability

4. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION DOESN'T SAY:
The pandas documentation does NOT:
- Warn about numerical instability with extreme values
- Mention that negative variances are possible due to implementation
- Provide any caveats about precision issues
- State that variance might be negative in edge cases
- Document any known limitations with large/small value combinations

5. COMPARISON WITH EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Expected: Variance should always be ≥ 0 (mathematical requirement)
- Documented: No mention of exceptions to this rule
- Actual: Returns negative values in certain cases
- Conclusion: The implementation violates both mathematical definition and reasonable expectations

6. SPECIFICATION CLARITY:
The function is clearly specified to compute variance, which has an unambiguous mathematical definition that requires non-negative results. The documentation doesn't need to explicitly state "variance is non-negative" because this is a fundamental mathematical property of variance itself.

CONCLUSION: The pandas documentation, combined with the mathematical definition of variance, clearly establishes that rolling.var() should NEVER return negative values. The current behavior violates both the mathematical definition and reasonable user expectations based on the documentation.
