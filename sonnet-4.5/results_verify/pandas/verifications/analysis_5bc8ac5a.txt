BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluation of the bug report against each possible triage category:

1. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
   Why it might be INVALID:
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly promise dimensionality preservation
   - The function technically works and returns an empty array as expected

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The behavior is demonstrably inconsistent (1D for fully masked, 2D for partially masked)
   - Input requirement states "Must be a 2D array" which implies 2D operations
   - Standard numpy behavior preserves dimensionality in similar operations
   - The inconsistency is objectively present and reproducible

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting issue)
   Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - Empty arrays might be considered an edge case
   - Both (0,) and (0, 0) shaped arrays are empty and contain no data

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - Dimensionality matters for subsequent array operations and broadcasting
   - The inconsistency can break code that expects consistent dimensions
   - This is not obscure - fully masked data is a reasonable use case
   - The fix is straightforward and improves consistency

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
   Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could argue that consistent dimensionality is a new feature

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
   - The function already preserves 2D in some empty cases
   - The capability exists; it's just not applied consistently

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
   Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - Documentation doesn't specify what happens with fully masked arrays
   - Could document the current behavior as intended

   Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The inconsistent behavior itself is the problem, not the documentation
   - Documenting "returns 1D for fully masked but 2D for partially masked" would be documenting a bug
   - The code behavior is objectively inconsistent

5. BUG (Valid bug report)
   Why it IS a BUG:
   - Clear inconsistency: same conceptual operation (removing all data) produces different dimensional results
   - Violates principle of least surprise
   - Breaks reasonable user expectations based on numpy patterns
   - Input is explicitly required to be 2D, suggesting 2D operations
   - Function names (compress_rows, compress_cols, compress_rowcols) are inherently 2D concepts
   - Similar numpy operations preserve dimensionality
   - The partially masked case that results in empty DOES preserve 2D
   - Easy to fix with the suggested solution

CONCLUSION:
This is a clear BUG. The function exhibits inconsistent behavior where:
- Fully masked 2D input → 1D empty output
- Partially masked 2D input with all removed → 2D empty output

This inconsistency cannot be justified as intended behavior. The function should consistently return 2D arrays when given 2D input, regardless of whether the result is empty due to full masking or complete removal via filtering.
