REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. BUG CONFIRMATION:
   The bug is real and reproducible. When using Series.rolling(window=2).mean() with the provided test data containing subnormal numbers, the function produces incorrect results.

2. REPRODUCTION RESULTS:
   Test Series: [1.0, 1.605551e-178, -2.798597e-225, -2.225074e-308, -2.798597e-225]

   At index 3 (window containing [-2.798597e-225, -2.225074e-308]):
   - Expected mean: -1.3992985e-225
   - Actual rolling mean: -1.112537e-308
   - Relative error: 100% (essentially completely wrong)

   At index 4 (window containing [-2.225074e-308, -2.798597e-225]):
   - Expected mean: -1.3992985e-225
   - Actual rolling mean: 0.0
   - Relative error: 100%

3. MATHEMATICAL INVARIANT VIOLATION:
   The bug violates a fundamental mathematical property: the mean of a set of numbers must be between the minimum and maximum values. The rolling mean produces values outside these bounds:
   - Window bounds: [-2.798597e-225, -2.225074e-308]
   - Rolling mean: -1.112537e-308 (OUTSIDE bounds)

4. PATTERN OF FAILURE:
   The bug specifically occurs when:
   - Processing values near the subnormal threshold (~2.2e-308 for float64)
   - The series contains a mix of normal and subnormal numbers
   - The rolling window transitions through these extreme values

5. INTERESTINGLY:
   - A simple 2-element series with just the problematic values works correctly
   - The bug manifests when these values are part of a longer series
   - This suggests the issue is related to the incremental update algorithm used for efficiency

The bug is consistently reproducible and represents a serious numerical accuracy issue that could silently corrupt scientific calculations.
