DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

PANDAS DOCUMENTATION:
The pandas documentation for Rolling.corr states:
- The method calculates rolling correlation using Pearson's correlation coefficient
- It returns values between -1 and 1
- Returns NaN for sequences with equal values (due to 0/0 division)
- Output dtype is np.float64

MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION:
According to mathematical literature and authoritative sources:
1. Pearson correlation coefficient is mathematically bounded to the range [-1, 1]
2. This range is a fundamental mathematical property, proven using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
3. Values outside this range are mathematically impossible by definition
4. A correlation of exactly +1 indicates perfect positive linear relationship
5. A correlation of exactly -1 indicates perfect negative linear relationship
6. A correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship

KEY DOCUMENTATION FINDING:
The pandas documentation explicitly states that the method "returns values between -1 and 1", which aligns with the mathematical definition of Pearson's correlation coefficient. Therefore, any value outside this range, even by a tiny amount like machine epsilon, violates both:
1. The documented behavior of the function
2. The fundamental mathematical definition of correlation

CONCLUSION:
The bug report correctly identifies that the function violates its documented behavior. The documentation promises values in [-1, 1], but the implementation can produce values slightly outside this range due to floating-point arithmetic errors. This is not a case of unspecified behavior - the valid range is explicitly documented and mathematically required.
