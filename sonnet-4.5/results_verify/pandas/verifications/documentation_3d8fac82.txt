DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Review of pandas.DataFrame.to_json()
--------------------------------------------------

The official pandas documentation states the following about the double_precision parameter:

1. Parameter Definition:
   - Name: double_precision
   - Type: int
   - Default value: 10
   - Description: "The number of decimal places to use when encoding floating point values"
   - Maximum value: 15 (raises ValueError if exceeded)

2. What the Documentation Says:
   - Clearly documents that the default is 10 decimal places
   - Specifies that this controls floating point encoding precision
   - States the maximum allowed value is 15

3. What the Documentation DOES NOT Say:
   - No warning that the default value causes precision loss for float64 values
   - No mention that float64 values typically require 15-17 significant digits for full precision
   - No explicit statement about round-trip guarantees or expectations
   - No comparison with Python's standard json module behavior (which preserves full precision)
   - No warning that data may be silently corrupted with default settings

4. Round-trip Expectations:
   - The documentation does not explicitly promise lossless round-trip serialization
   - However, it also does not warn users that round-trip will lose precision by default
   - The read_json documentation mentions some round-trip issues (with index names) but not float precision

5. User Expectations vs Documentation:
   - Users reasonably expect that df.to_json() followed by pd.read_json() should preserve data
   - This is a fundamental expectation of serialization/deserialization
   - The documentation does not clearly communicate that this expectation will be violated for floats

Conclusion:
----------
While the documentation technically describes the parameter correctly, it fails to warn users about the significant data integrity implications of the default setting. The documentation is incomplete rather than incorrect - it describes what happens but not the consequences.
