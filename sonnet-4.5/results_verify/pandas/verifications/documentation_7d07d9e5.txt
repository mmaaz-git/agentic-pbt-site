## Documentation Findings for RangeIndex._concat

### Method Nature
The `_concat` method is a **private method** (indicated by the leading underscore). This is not part of the public API as documented in the official pandas documentation. Neither the RangeIndex documentation nor the base Index documentation mentions this method publicly.

### Documentation Status
- The method has internal docstring documentation explaining it's "Overriding parent method for the case of all RangeIndex instances"
- The docstring describes behavior when all indexes are RangeIndex instances
- No public API documentation exists for this method
- The base Index class also has a `_concat` method (also private) with a simple docstring: "Concatenate multiple Index objects."

### Name Parameter Behavior
The base Index._concat method signature shows it accepts a `name` parameter:
```python
def _concat(self, to_concat: list[Index], name: Hashable) -> Index:
```

The base implementation uses the name parameter explicitly in the return statement:
```python
return Index._with_infer(result, name=name)
```

### Key Observations
1. This is an **internal/private method** not meant for direct user consumption
2. The method overrides a parent implementation from the base Index class
3. The RangeIndex implementation has multiple branches that use `.rename(name)` (lines 973, 984, 993, 997)
4. However, when `len(indexes) == 1`, it returns `indexes[0]` directly without applying the name (line 951)
5. The base Index class implementation always applies the name parameter

### Implications
Since this is a private method (prefixed with underscore), it's an internal implementation detail. The behavior consistency between parent and child class implementations is more about code maintainability than public API contract. Users should not be directly calling private methods.
