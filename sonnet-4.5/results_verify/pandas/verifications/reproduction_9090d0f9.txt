Reproduction Results for the Bug Report

I successfully reproduced the reported behavior. Here are the findings:

1. Basic Reproduction - CONFIRMED:
   - DataFrame with Int64 column containing [1, 2, None]
   - Original dtype: Int64 with <NA> value
   - After round-trip: float64 with NaN value
   - Values changed from integers to floats (1 -> 1.0, 2 -> 2.0)

2. Without NA values - INTERESTING FINDING:
   - DataFrame with Int64 column containing [1, 2, 3] (no NA)
   - Original dtype: Int64
   - After round-trip: int64 (lowercase 'i', not Int64!)
   - The nullable Int64 dtype is converted to regular int64 even without NA values

3. Mixed columns test:
   - Int64 column WITH NA: converted to float64
   - Int64 column WITHOUT NA: converted to int64 (not Int64)
   - Regular float64 and string columns: preserved correctly

4. Hypothesis test results:
   - The test FAILS even for values without NA
   - Int64 is always converted to either int64 (no NA) or float64 (with NA)
   - The nullable Int64 dtype is NEVER preserved through the interchange

5. Type conversion patterns observed:
   - Int64 with NA values -> float64
   - Int64 without NA values -> int64 (not Int64)
   - The interchange protocol does not preserve the nullable integer dtype

The bug report's claim is technically correct but incomplete:
- Int64 with NA does convert to float64 (as reported)
- Int64 without NA converts to int64 (not mentioned in report)
- The Int64 nullable dtype is never preserved (broader issue than reported)
