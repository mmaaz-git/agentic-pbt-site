DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:

1. PANDAS MISSING DATA DOCUMENTATION:
   - pd.NA is described as "a singleton experimental value" for missing data
   - pd.NaT is described for datetime/timedelta/period types
   - The documentation explicitly states NA is a singleton
   - No explicit statement about NaT/NaTType being a singleton

2. TYPE ANNOTATIONS DOCUMENTATION:
   - Documentation mentions: "For typing applications, use api.typing.NAType"
   - Documentation mentions: "For typing applications, use api.typing.NaTType"
   - These are meant for type annotations, not general use

3. USAGE GUIDANCE:
   - Users are expected to use pd.NA and pd.NaT directly
   - The documentation does not encourage calling NAType() or NaTType() constructors
   - The typing classes are primarily for type hints

4. SINGLETON BEHAVIOR:
   - NAType is explicitly documented as "The NA singleton" in some references
   - NaTType has no explicit documentation about being a singleton
   - However, there's no documentation that says NaTType should NOT be a singleton

5. CONSISTENCY EXPECTATIONS:
   - The documentation does not explicitly state that NAType and NaTType should have consistent behavior
   - However, they are presented as parallel missing value indicators in api.typing
   - Both serve similar purposes for different data types

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly specify that NaTType() should be a singleton. However:
- NAType is documented as a singleton
- Both are presented as parallel typing utilities
- There's no documentation suggesting they should behave differently
- The inconsistency is not documented as intentional
