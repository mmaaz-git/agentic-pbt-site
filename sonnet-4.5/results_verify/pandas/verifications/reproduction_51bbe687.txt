## Bug Reproduction Results

### Confirmed Behavior
The bug report is technically accurate. When AbstractMethodError is instantiated with an instance (not a class) and methodtype="classmethod", calling str() on the error object raises an AttributeError.

### Test Results

1. **Simple Reproduction**: CONFIRMED
   - Creating `AbstractMethodError(MyClass(), methodtype="classmethod")` and calling `str()` on it raises:
   - `AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__name__'`

2. **Testing All Method Types with Instance**:
   - methodtype="method": Works correctly, outputs "This method must be defined in the concrete class TestClass"
   - methodtype="classmethod": FAILS with AttributeError
   - methodtype="staticmethod": Works correctly
   - methodtype="property": Works correctly

3. **Testing All Method Types with Class Object**:
   - ALL method types work correctly when passed a class object instead of an instance
   - methodtype="classmethod" with class: Outputs "This classmethod must be defined in the concrete class TestClass"

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue is in the `__str__` method implementation (line 303-308):
```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    if self.methodtype == "classmethod":
        name = self.class_instance.__name__  # Assumes class_instance is a class
    else:
        name = type(self.class_instance).__name__  # Works with instances
```

When methodtype="classmethod", the code assumes `class_instance` is a class object (which has `__name__`).
For other method types, it uses `type(class_instance).__name__` which works with both classes and instances.

### Technical Validity
- The bug report's code examples are correct and reproduce the issue
- The error occurs exactly as described
- The suggested fixes in the bug report would both work:
  - Option 1: Add validation in __init__ to reject instances when methodtype="classmethod"
  - Option 2: Handle both cases in __str__ by checking if it's a type

### Usage Pattern Analysis
The conventional usage shown in documentation is:
- For classmethods: Pass `cls` (the class) with methodtype="classmethod"
- For instance methods: Pass `self` (the instance) with methodtype="method"

However, the API accepts any combination without validation, leading to this crash when unconventional but technically allowed combinations are used.
