REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug using both the provided Hypothesis test and the manual reproduction code.

Bug Confirmation:
----------------
1. The Hypothesis test fails with multiple examples, confirming that the issue is systematic and not limited to a specific edge case.

2. The manual reproduction code confirms the exact behavior described in the bug report:
   - With values=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.84375], bins=2, precision=3
   - The bins array returned via retbins=True is: [-0.00184375, 0.921875, 1.84375]
   - The interval categories have boundaries: [(-0.00184, 0.922], (0.922, 1.844]]
   - These values do NOT match

3. Additional testing reveals the precision parameter's effect:
   - precision=1: interval boundaries become (-0.002, 0.9] and (0.9, 1.8]
   - precision=3: interval boundaries become (-0.00184, 0.922] and (0.922, 1.844]
   - precision=10: interval boundaries become (-0.00184375, 0.921875] and (0.921875, 1.84375]

Key Finding:
-----------
The precision parameter is NOT just controlling display/string representation. It is actually modifying the numerical values of the interval boundaries themselves. The intervals' .left and .right properties return different float values depending on the precision parameter, while the bins array returned via retbins=True always contains the original unrounded values.

This creates an inconsistency where:
- bins[i] != categories[i].left (in most cases)
- bins[i+1] != categories[i].right (in most cases)

The bug is real and reproducible.
