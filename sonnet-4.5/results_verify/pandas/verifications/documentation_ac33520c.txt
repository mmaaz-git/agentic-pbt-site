## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The function `length_of_indexer` in `pandas/core/indexers/utils.py` has minimal documentation:
```
"""
Return the expected length of target[indexer]
Returns
-------
int
"""
```

This docstring clearly states that the function should return "the expected length of target[indexer]" - meaning it should predict how many elements would result from indexing a target array with the given indexer.

### Key Findings

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is an internal utility (in `pandas.core.indexers.utils`) not part of the public API, as it doesn't appear in the official pandas API documentation.

2. **Expected Behavior from Documentation**: The docstring states it returns "the expected length of target[indexer]". When I tested this empirically:
   - `target[range(1, 0, 1)]` produces an empty array with length 0
   - `target[range(10, 0, 2)]` produces an empty array with length 0
   - The function should therefore return 0 for these cases

3. **Actual Usage**: The function is imported and used in `pandas/core/indexing.py` where it's used to determine the expected length of an indexed result: `lplane_indexer = length_of_indexer(pi, self.obj.index)` with a comment "lplane_indexer gives the expected length of obj[indexer[0]]"

4. **Range Object Behavior**: Python's range objects have well-defined length semantics:
   - `len(range(start, stop, step))` returns the number of elements in the range
   - Empty ranges (where no values would be generated) have length 0
   - This is consistent regardless of why the range is empty (stop <= start with positive step, start <= stop with negative step, etc.)

5. **No Special Cases Documented**: The documentation doesn't mention any special handling for empty ranges or negative lengths. There's no indication that negative return values are expected or meaningful.

### Conclusion
The documentation, while brief, is clear: the function should return the length that would result from indexing. Since `target[empty_range]` produces an array of length 0, and Python's `len(empty_range)` returns 0, the function should return 0 for empty ranges, not negative values. The current behavior contradicts both the documented purpose and the natural semantics of range objects in Python.
