## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**
1. The behavior is inconsistent with similar pandas functions (register_series_accessor warns and overrides)
2. Silent failure violates the principle of least surprise
3. The current implementation makes it impossible to update or override dtype registrations
4. The registry appends duplicates but find() only returns the first, creating internal inconsistency
5. No documentation exists saying this behavior is intentional

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Weak evidence against:**
1. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise override behavior
2. One could argue that first-come-first-served is a valid design choice

However, this is weak because:
- The lack of documentation doesn't justify inconsistent behavior
- Silent failures are generally considered bugs in API design
- The inconsistency with register_series_accessor suggests this wasn't a deliberate design choice

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Not applicable:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - duplicate names are a reasonable scenario
- The issue affects normal usage patterns (e.g., reloading modules, updating dtype definitions)
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Could be argued but unlikely:**
- One could claim that override behavior is a "new feature"
- However, this is really fixing broken/inconsistent behavior rather than adding new functionality
- The current state leaves the registry in an inconsistent state (contains duplicates but can't access them)

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Partially applicable but insufficient:**
- The documentation could be updated to warn about this behavior
- However, the behavior itself is problematic and inconsistent with pandas design patterns
- Just documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct

### Conclusion:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation:
1. Silently fails in a way that users cannot detect or work around
2. Is inconsistent with similar pandas functions that handle this case properly
3. Leaves the internal registry in an inconsistent state
4. Violates reasonable user expectations based on pandas design patterns

The proposed fix (warning and overriding like register_series_accessor) is appropriate and maintains consistency across the pandas API.
