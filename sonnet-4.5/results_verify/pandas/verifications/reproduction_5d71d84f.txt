BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue concerns pandas.core.window.rolling.Rolling.corr returning correlation values slightly outside the mathematically valid range of [-1, 1].

TEST EXECUTION:
1. Ran the provided reproduction code with values1=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0] and values2 being identical.

2. Observed output:
   - Rolling correlation at index 4: 1.0000000000000002
   - This value is indeed > 1.0 (True)
   - Difference from 1.0: 2.220446049250313e-16 (machine epsilon)

3. Verified that the hypothesis test fails with the assertion error:
   "At index 4: correlation 1.0000000000000002 outside [-1, 1]"

COMPARISON WITH NUMPY:
- When computing the correlation for the same window using numpy.corrcoef, it returns exactly 1.0
- This demonstrates that NumPy handles the numerical precision correctly, while pandas does not

KEY FINDING:
The bug is real and reproducible. The pandas rolling correlation function returns 1.0000000000000002 (exceeding the upper bound by approximately 2e-16), which violates the mathematical constraint that correlation must be in [-1, 1]. While the error is tiny (machine epsilon level), it is technically incorrect and could cause issues in downstream code that relies on this mathematical invariant.
