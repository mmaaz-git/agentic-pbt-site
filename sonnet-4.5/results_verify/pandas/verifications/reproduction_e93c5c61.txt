Bug Reproduction Results for pandas.arrays.IntervalArray.overlaps
==================================================================

1. Test Case 1 - Basic IntervalArray.overlaps(IntervalArray):
   Code: arr.overlaps(arr) where arr = IntervalArray([(0, 1], (2, 3]])
   Result: NotImplementedError raised
   Expected (according to docs): Boolean array indicating overlaps

2. Test Case 2 - Hypothesis Test Failing Input:
   Code: arr.overlaps(arr) where arr = IntervalArray([(0.0, 0.0)])
   Result: NotImplementedError raised
   Expected (according to docs): Boolean array [True] since interval overlaps with itself

3. Test Case 3 - Scalar Interval Input (control test):
   Code: arr.overlaps(pd.Interval(0.5, 1.5))
   Result: SUCCESS - Returns [True, False] as expected
   This demonstrates the method works correctly with scalar Interval objects

4. Hypothesis Test:
   The hypothesis test attempts to verify that intervals overlap with themselves (reflexive property)
   Result: FAILS immediately on first example due to NotImplementedError

5. Source Code Verification:
   The source code explicitly contains:
   ```python
   if isinstance(other, (IntervalArray, ABCIntervalIndex)):
       raise NotImplementedError
   ```
   This is an intentional check that raises NotImplementedError for IntervalArray inputs.

6. Documentation vs Implementation:
   - Documentation says: "other : IntervalArray"
   - Implementation accepts: Only scalar pd.Interval objects
   - Examples show: Only scalar pd.Interval usage

Technical Assessment:
The bug report is technically accurate in that:
1. The documentation states the parameter should be IntervalArray
2. The implementation raises NotImplementedError for IntervalArray inputs
3. This creates a contract violation between documentation and implementation

The method currently only supports element-wise comparison between an IntervalArray and a single Interval, not between two IntervalArrays.
