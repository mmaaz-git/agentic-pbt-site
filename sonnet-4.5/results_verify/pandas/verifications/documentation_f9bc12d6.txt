DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have thoroughly reviewed the documentation for pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix from multiple sources:

1. OFFICIAL PANDAS DOCUMENTATION (pandas.pydata.org):
   - Clearly states: diagonal : {'hist', 'kde'}
   - Description: "Pick between 'kde' and 'hist' for either Kernel Density Estimation or Histogram plot in the diagonal."
   - The notation {'hist', 'kde'} is Python's standard way to document that only these specific values are allowed

2. FUNCTION DOCSTRING (from source code and help() output):
   - Line 181: diagonal : {'hist', 'kde'}
   - Same description as online documentation
   - Uses set notation to explicitly define the allowed values

3. DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY:
   - Both online documentation and docstring are consistent
   - They clearly communicate that ONLY 'hist' or 'kde' are valid values
   - There is no ambiguity about what values are acceptable

4. PYTHON DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS:
   - The notation {'value1', 'value2'} in parameter documentation is the standard Python convention for indicating a parameter accepts only specific literal values
   - This is widely understood in the Python community
   - Examples from other libraries: matplotlib's marker styles, pandas' merge 'how' parameter, etc.

5. API CONTRACT:
   - The documentation establishes a clear API contract
   - Users have a reasonable expectation that:
     a) Only 'hist' or 'kde' will be accepted
     b) Other values should raise an error
     c) The function should validate input according to the documented contract

6. NO CONTRADICTIONS FOUND:
   - There is no documentation suggesting other values might work
   - There is no mention of default behavior for invalid values
   - The documentation does not say "including but not limited to" or similar phrases

CONCLUSION:
The documentation unambiguously states that the diagonal parameter accepts only 'hist' or 'kde'. The current implementation's acceptance of invalid values directly violates the documented API contract. This is not a documentation error - the documentation correctly describes the intended behavior, but the implementation fails to enforce it.
