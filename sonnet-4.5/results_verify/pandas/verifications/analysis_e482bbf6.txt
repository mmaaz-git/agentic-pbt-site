## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Clear documentation violation**: The docstring explicitly states the function "blocks until a non-empty text string exists" and "returns this text"
2. **Type safety issue**: The function returns non-string types (None, int, bool, list, dict) when it should only return strings
3. **Real-world impact**: On macOS with pyobjc backend, paste() actually returns None when clipboard has no string data
4. **Logical error**: Using `clipboardText != ""` instead of proper type and content checking
5. **Breaks expected behavior**: Callers expecting to wait for text get unexpected types immediately

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- No strong reasons against this being a bug

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None. The documentation is explicit, the test cases are valid, and the behavior clearly violates the documented contract.

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The documentation explicitly states "non-empty text string"
- The implementation demonstrably violates this specification
- The bug report accurately describes the issue

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Could argue it's an edge case since paste() normally returns strings
- Might claim it's internal/undocumented function (though it has clear docstring)

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it happens in real scenarios on macOS
- The function has explicit documentation via docstring
- Type safety is important for reliability
- The fix is simple and doesn't break backward compatibility for correct usage

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could update docs to say "blocks until clipboard content is not empty string"
- Could document that it returns whatever paste() returns

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current documentation makes semantic sense - waiting for TEXT
- Changing docs to match broken behavior would make the function less useful
- The name "waitForPaste" implies waiting for valid paste content (text), not arbitrary values

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could frame type checking as a new feature
- Could argue that filtering non-strings is an enhancement

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The documentation already promises this behavior
- It's fixing a bug, not adding new functionality
- The expected behavior is already specified in the docstring

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has explicit documentation stating it should wait for and return a "non-empty text string", but instead it returns any non-empty-string value including None, integers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries. This violates the documented contract and can cause type errors in production code, especially on macOS where paste() returns None when no string data exists on the clipboard. The proposed fix correctly addresses the issue by checking both type and content.
