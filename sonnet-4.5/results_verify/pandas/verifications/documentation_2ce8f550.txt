DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Review:
---------------------
I reviewed the official pandas.core.algorithms.factorize documentation through:
1. Python's built-in help() function
2. Online pandas documentation at pandas.pydata.org

Key Documentation Statement:
----------------------------
The documentation explicitly states in the Returns section:

"codes : ndarray
    An integer ndarray that's an indexer into `uniques`.
    ``uniques.take(codes)`` will have the same values as `values`."

This is an unambiguous guarantee that the round-trip property must hold:
uniques.take(codes) should produce the same values as the input.

Absence of Null Character Limitations:
---------------------------------------
The documentation does NOT mention any limitations regarding:
- Null characters ('\x00')
- Special characters in strings
- C-style string termination issues
- Any exclusions for certain byte values in strings

The documentation discusses handling of None and NaN values extensively, but these are
different from the null character '\x00', which is a valid string character in Python.

Documentation Examples:
-----------------------
The examples show factorization of string arrays like:
- ['b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b']
- ['a', 'a', 'c']

These examples work correctly, but don't test edge cases like null characters.

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation makes a clear promise about the round-trip property without any
stated exceptions for null characters. Since Python strings can contain null characters
as valid data, and the documentation doesn't exclude them, users have a reasonable
expectation that factorize should handle them correctly.

The behavior violates the documented contract of the function.
