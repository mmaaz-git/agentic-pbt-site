## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior observed (returning ndarray for plain dtype) might be the intended design, and users are expected to use SparseDtype when they want to maintain sparsity. The examples in the documentation all use SparseDtype, not plain dtype strings, which could suggest this is the expected pattern.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states "The output will always be a SparseArray" without any qualifications or exceptions. The word "always" is unambiguous, and the dtype parameter accepts "np.dtype or ExtensionDtype" which includes plain dtype strings. The contract is clearly violated.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be seen as a minor documentation inconsistency that doesn't affect practical usage. Users who need sparse arrays can use SparseDtype, and the current behavior of converting to dense for plain dtypes might be a useful convenience feature that many rely on.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it's a fundamental API contract violation where the method returns a completely different type than documented. The distinction between SparseArray and ndarray is significant for memory usage and performance, making this more than a minor inconsistency.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current implementation behavior appears intentional and potentially useful - automatically converting to dense when using plain dtypes while maintaining sparsity with SparseDtype. The documentation should be updated to accurately reflect this dual behavior rather than changing working code that users may depend on.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
While the documentation is wrong, one could argue the implementation should be fixed instead to match the documented behavior, as users may have written code expecting SparseArray returns based on the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that having astype() always return SparseArray (as documented) would be a new feature, since the current behavior of returning ndarray for plain dtypes has likely been in place for a while and users depend on it.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not requesting new functionality - the documentation already promises this behavior. It's either a bug in the implementation or an error in the documentation, not a request for something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The implementation directly violates the documented API contract. The documentation states "The output will always be a SparseArray" but the method returns ndarray for plain dtype inputs. This is a clear bug where the code doesn't match its specification.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
If the current behavior is intentional and useful (which it appears to be given the clear distinction in behavior between SparseDtype and plain dtype), then this is a documentation issue rather than a code bug. The implementation works correctly, just not as documented.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a clear case where the documentation and implementation disagree. The documentation makes an unambiguous promise that "The output will always be a SparseArray" but the implementation returns numpy.ndarray when given plain dtype strings like 'int64'. The bug report accurately identifies this discrepancy and provides proper reproduction steps.

The key question is whether to fix the documentation or the implementation. Given that the current implementation behavior appears to be intentional (different code paths for SparseDtype vs plain dtype) and potentially useful (automatic densification for type conversion), changing the implementation could break existing code. Users may rely on the current behavior of getting dense arrays when using plain dtypes.

The most pragmatic solution is to fix the documentation to accurately describe the actual behavior: astype() returns SparseArray when given SparseDtype, and returns ndarray when given plain dtype. This is exactly what the bug report suggests as a fix. Therefore, this should be categorized as DOCUMENTATION_FIX rather than BUG, as the implementation appears to be working as designed, just not as documented.
