## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Simple Test Case Reproduction
When running the provided simple test case:
```python
from pandas.io.formats.format import _trim_zeros_complex

values = [complex(1, 2), complex(3, 4)]
str_values = [str(v) for v in values]
result = _trim_zeros_complex(str_values)
```

**Expected:** Input `['(1+2j)', '(3+4j)']` should preserve parentheses
**Actual:** Output `['(1+2j', '(3+4j']` - the closing parenthesis is lost

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The hypothesis test also failed immediately with the specific failing input `[(1.0, 1.0)]`:
- Input: `['(1+1j)']`
- Output: `['(1+1j']`
- The closing parenthesis is incorrectly removed

### Root Cause Analysis
I examined the implementation and found the exact issue:

1. The function uses `re.split(r"([j+-])", x)` to split complex number strings
2. For input `"(1+2j)"`, this produces: `['(1', '+', '2', 'j', ')']`
3. The function then extracts:
   - Real part: `"".join(trimmed[:-4])` = `'(1'` (takes everything except last 4 elements)
   - Imaginary part: `"".join(trimmed[-4:-2])` = `'+2'` (takes elements -4 to -2)
4. The closing parenthesis `)` at index -1 is never captured in either part
5. During reconstruction, only the real part, sign, imaginary part, and 'j' are combined, losing the closing parenthesis

### Python Complex Number Representation
Testing Python's complex number string representation confirms:
- Complex numbers with non-zero real parts ALWAYS have parentheses: `(1+2j)`, `(3-4j)`, `(-1+0j)`
- Complex numbers with zero real part do NOT have parentheses: `2j`, `-3j`, `0j`
- This is consistent for both native Python complex and numpy complex types

### Conclusion
The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The function incorrectly handles the standard Python complex number format with parentheses, losing the closing parenthesis during processing.
