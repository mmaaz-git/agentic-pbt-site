## Reproduction of Bug Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The error message in `pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError.__init__` does indeed have swapped variables in the f-string.

### Hypothesis Test Results
- Ran the provided Hypothesis property-based test
- Test failed as expected on input '0' (and would fail on any invalid methodtype)
- The error message produced: "methodtype must be one of 0, got {'method', 'property', 'staticmethod', 'classmethod'} instead."
- This confirms the variables are swapped - it shows the invalid input where it should show valid options, and vice versa

### Manual Reproduction Results
- Ran the manual example with methodtype='foobar'
- Actual output: "methodtype must be one of foobar, got {'method', 'property', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod'} instead."
- Expected output: "methodtype must be one of {'method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', 'property'}, got foobar instead."
- This confirms the bug: the error message template has the variables in the wrong order

### Source Code Verification
Located the bug in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/errors/__init__.py` at line 298:
```python
raise ValueError(
    f"methodtype must be one of {methodtype}, got {types} instead."
)
```

The variables `{methodtype}` and `{types}` are indeed swapped. The correct version should be:
```python
f"methodtype must be one of {types}, got {methodtype} instead."
```

### Impact
This is a clear bug in the error message formatting. When users provide an invalid methodtype, they receive a confusing error message that suggests they should use the invalid value they just provided, rather than showing them the correct valid options.
