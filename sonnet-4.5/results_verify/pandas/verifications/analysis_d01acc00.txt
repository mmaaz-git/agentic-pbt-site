## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function technically works as intended for most practical use cases. One could argue that values extremely close to 0 or 100 (like 0.99999 which is 99.999%) are edge cases that users wouldn't encounter in real-world scenarios. The function's primary purpose is formatting, not mathematical precision.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation is crystal clear - it explicitly states "no entry is *rounded* to 0% or 100%" with emphasis on "rounded" and clarifies "(unless already equal to it)". The provided examples in the documentation demonstrate this behavior (0.9999 → '99.99%', not '100%'). The bug violates a clearly documented contract.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The bug only occurs in very specific edge cases where values are extremely close to 0 or 100. In practice, percentiles like 0.99999 (99.999%) are rare, and users might not care about the difference between 99.999% and 100% for display purposes. The impact on real-world usage is minimal, and fixing it might add unnecessary complexity.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The documentation makes an explicit promise about this behavior, suggesting it's an important design decision. The docstring even emphasizes the word "rounded" with asterisks, indicating this is a key feature. If the maintainers didn't care about this property, they wouldn't have documented it so prominently with multiple examples demonstrating it.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Perhaps the documentation is overly strict and doesn't reflect the actual intended behavior. The code might be working as designed, and the documentation should be updated to say "values very close to 0% or 100% may be rounded to those values for display purposes" or add exceptions for when np.isclose determines values are effectively integers.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is very deliberate and specific about this behavior, with examples that demonstrate the intended behavior (0.9999 → '99.99%'). The documentation appears to be the specification, not an error. The code implementation seems to be the part that's incorrect, not the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that the current behavior (rounding very close values to 0% or 100%) is the existing behavior, and the bug report is requesting a new feature to prevent this rounding. The request would be to enhance the function to strictly adhere to never rounding to 0% or 100% except for exact values.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality - it's pointing out that the existing function doesn't work according to its own documented specification. The documentation already promises this behavior, so it's not a new feature but rather a bug where the implementation doesn't match the specification.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation explicitly and unambiguously states that no entry should be rounded to 0% or 100% unless the input is exactly 0 or 1. The examples in the documentation show this behavior (0.9999 → '99.99%'). The code at line 1603 unconditionally rounds values that are "close to integers" without checking if this would violate the documented constraint. This is a clear case where the implementation fails to meet its documented specification.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if we consider the documentation to be aspirational rather than contractual, or if we believe the edge cases are so rare that they don't constitute a real bug. However, these are weak arguments given how explicit the documentation is.

**Overall consideration**
The bug report identifies a legitimate discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual implementation. The documentation is explicit, detailed, and emphatic about the constraint that values should not be rounded to 0% or 100% unless they are exactly 0 or 1. The documentation even provides examples demonstrating this behavior, showing 0.9999 becoming '99.99%' rather than '100%'. The bug report correctly identifies the exact line of code (line 1603) that causes this violation and provides a minimal reproducible example.

While the bug might be considered an edge case (values like 0.99999 are rare in practice), the fact remains that the code violates its explicitly documented contract. The documentation uses emphasis (asterisks around "rounded") and provides multiple examples to illustrate this specific behavior, suggesting it was an intentional design decision by the original authors.

Given that the documentation is clear, specific, and internally consistent, and the code demonstrably violates this documented behavior in reproducible cases, this should be classified as a BUG. The implementation should be fixed to match the documented specification rather than changing the documentation to match the buggy implementation.
