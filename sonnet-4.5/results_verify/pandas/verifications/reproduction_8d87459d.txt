## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for pandas.core.reshape.tile.cut with mixed sign tiny floats.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Property-based test**: The test fails with the exact error reported:
   - Input: `values=[1.1125369292536007e-308, -6.312184867281418e-301], n_bins=2`
   - Error: "missing values must be missing in the same location both left and right sides"
   - Also produces a RuntimeWarning: "invalid value encountered in divide"

2. **Simple reproduction case**: Confirmed the exact same behavior as reported:
   - Input values are valid (non-NaN)
   - Function crashes with confusing error message about missing values
   - The error occurs even though no missing values were provided

### Root Cause Identified

Through detailed tracing, I identified the exact issue:

1. **Bin calculation works correctly**: When `pd.cut()` computes bin edges using `np.linspace()`, the bins are calculated correctly:
   - Bins: `[-6.31849705e-301, -3.15609238e-301, 1.11253693e-308]`

2. **Failure occurs in `_format_labels()`**: The problem happens when formatting labels for the bins:
   - The `_round_frac()` function is called on each bin edge
   - For the tiny value `1.1125369292536007e-308`, it calculates:
     - `frac = 1.1125369292536007e-308, whole = 0.0`
     - `log10(abs(frac)) = -307.95...`
     - This results in `digits = 310` for rounding precision
   - `np.around(1.1125369292536007e-308, 310)` returns `NaN`

3. **NaN propagation**: The NaN value in the breaks causes:
   - IntervalIndex creation to have inconsistent NaN positions
   - The validation error "missing values must be missing in the same location"

### Verification

The bug is 100% reproducible and matches the reported behavior exactly. The error message is indeed confusing since there are no actual missing values in the input - the NaN values are created internally due to numerical precision issues when trying to round extremely small floating-point values to an impossible precision (310 decimal places).

This is a legitimate bug where valid input data causes an internal failure with an unhelpful error message.
