## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The pandas documentation does not specify that quoted values should be treated differently from unquoted values in terms of type inference. The behavior is consistent with the documented automatic type inference that pandas performs on all CSV data. There is no documented promise that quoting preserves string types, and the RFC 4180 CSV standard does not mandate any type inference behavior at all - it only defines the syntax for encoding fields. Therefore, the current behavior may be working as designed and documented.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report accurately describes behavior that does occur - quoted strings are indeed converted to numeric types. The technical reproduction is correct, and the round-trip property is genuinely broken. The behavior does violate a reasonable user expectation that explicit quoting should preserve string values, even if this expectation isn't documented.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
While the behavior may be surprising, it has likely been this way for many years and many users may depend on the current automatic type inference behavior. The conversion of 'Inf' to infinity is deeply embedded in the parser and appears separate from the NA handling system, suggesting it's a fundamental design choice. Users who need to preserve these strings have workarounds available (using dtype parameter or combinations of keep_default_na/na_filter for most values). Changing this behavior would be a breaking change affecting existing code.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue causes real data corruption when users have legitimate string data containing 'Inf', 'NaN', etc. The lack of any way to fully disable infinity conversion (even with na_filter=False) suggests this is an oversight rather than intentional design. The round-trip property is important for data integrity, and violating it silently could be considered a serious issue worth fixing.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be clearer about the fact that type inference applies to all values regardless of quoting. It should explicitly state that quoted values like "Inf" will still be converted to numeric types. The documentation could also better explain that infinity conversion is separate from NA handling and cannot be disabled. Adding clear warnings about this behavior and documenting the workarounds would help users understand and work around the limitation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current documentation doesn't explicitly promise that quoted values are preserved as strings, so it's not technically incorrect. The behavior is consistent with the general principle that pandas performs automatic type inference. Simply documenting an unintuitive behavior doesn't fix the underlying issue that users reasonably expect quoted values to be preserved.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The request for quoted values to be preserved as strings could be seen as asking for a new feature - a quote-aware type inference mode. This would be an enhancement to add a new parameter like 'respect_quotes=True' that would treat all quoted values as strings. The current system doesn't have this capability, so adding it would be a new feature rather than fixing a bug. The CSV standard doesn't require this behavior, so implementing it would be going beyond the standard.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The ability to round-trip data through CSV is a basic expectation, not a new feature. Users aren't asking for new functionality but rather for the existing CSV reading to not corrupt their data. The fact that quoting doesn't preserve string types could be seen as a missing basic functionality rather than a request for enhancement.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The round-trip property is fundamentally broken - data written to CSV cannot be read back identically even with explicit quoting. This violates the principle of least surprise and a basic expectation of data integrity. Most other CSV parsers respect quoting for type preservation. The fact that infinity conversion cannot be disabled at all (unlike NA values) suggests this is an oversight. The silent data corruption when legitimate string values like 'Inf' (which could be abbreviations or codes) are converted to numeric types is a serious issue.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The behavior is consistent with pandas' documented approach of automatic type inference on all data. The documentation never promises that quoted values will be preserved as strings. The behavior has likely been this way for many versions, suggesting it's intentional design. Users have partial workarounds available through dtype and other parameters. The CSV RFC doesn't specify type inference behavior, so pandas is free to implement it as they choose.

**Overall consideration**
This issue sits at the intersection of user expectations, documented behavior, and design philosophy. The bug report is technically accurate - the described behavior does occur and the round-trip property is broken. However, pandas has never documented that quotes preserve string types, and the automatic type inference is applied consistently to all data as designed. The key question is whether the reasonable user expectation that quoted values should be preserved as strings constitutes a bug when violated, even if not explicitly documented.

The most compelling argument for this being a bug is the complete inability to disable infinity conversion. While NA value conversion can be controlled with keep_default_na=False, there is no equivalent for infinity values. This asymmetry suggests the infinity conversion may be an oversight rather than intentional design. However, the long-standing nature of this behavior and the availability of partial workarounds (dtype='str') suggests this is known and accepted behavior.

Given that the documentation doesn't promise quote preservation, the behavior is consistent with pandas' general type inference approach, and workarounds exist for users who need to preserve these values, this appears to be a case where the documentation could be improved to clarify the behavior rather than a bug in the code. The request to change the behavior to respect quotes would be better classified as a feature request for a new quote-aware parsing mode.
