## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Data
Data: [1.0, -4294967297.0, 0.99999, 0.0, 0.0, 1.6675355247098508e-21]
Window size: 3

### Reproduction Successful - Bug Confirmed
The bug was successfully reproduced. At window index 5 (containing values [0.0, 0.0, 1.6675355247098508e-21]):

**Pandas Results:**
- Rolling mean: 1.5894571940104224e-07
- Rolling min: 0.0
- Rolling max: 1.6675355247098508e-21

**Expected Results (calculated independently):**
- True mean: 5.558451749032836e-22
- Min: 0.0
- Max: 1.6675355247098508e-21

### Mathematical Invariant Violation
The bug violates a fundamental mathematical property:
- **Invariant**: For any set of numbers, min ≤ mean ≤ max
- **Violation**: mean (1.5894571940104224e-07) > max (1.6675355247098508e-21)
- This is mathematically impossible and represents a clear error

### Error Magnitude
- Pandas result: 1.5894571940104224e-07
- True mean: 5.558451749032836e-22
- **Relative error: 2.86 × 10^16 %** (approximately 14 orders of magnitude)
- The result is wrong by a factor of approximately 286,000,000,000,000

### Root Cause Analysis
Through simulation, I identified the likely cause:
1. Pandas uses an incremental accumulator approach for rolling calculations
2. When the window slides from containing -4294967297.0 to not containing it:
   - The accumulator should become 0.0 + 0.0 + 1.6675355247098508e-21
   - But due to floating-point precision errors, it becomes 4.632568358919914e-07
3. This error (4.63e-07) is massive compared to the actual values (1.67e-21)

### Hypothesis Test Results
- The specific failing example consistently reproduces the bug
- The property-based test with 100 random examples passed (likely because they didn't hit the specific conditions that trigger the precision error)
- The bug appears to require very large numbers (like -4294967297 ≈ -2^32) to trigger

### Verification of Bug Report Claims
All claims in the bug report are accurate:
1. ✓ The rolling mean violates the min ≤ mean ≤ max invariant
2. ✓ The error is triggered by large numbers in the series
3. ✓ The error persists to subsequent windows that don't contain the large number
4. ✓ No warning or error is raised despite the massive calculation error
5. ✓ The provided test case consistently reproduces the issue
