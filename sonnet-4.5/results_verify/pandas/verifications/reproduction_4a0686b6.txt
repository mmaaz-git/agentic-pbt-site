## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Successfully Reproduced
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs when requesting more chunks than there are rows in the DataFrame.

### Test Results

#### Test Case 1: 1 row, 2 chunks requested
- Chunk 0: 1 rows
- Chunk 1: 0 rows (EMPTY)

#### Test Case 2: 5 rows, 10 chunks requested
- Chunks 0-4: 1 row each
- Chunks 5-9: 0 rows each (5 EMPTY chunks)

### Root Cause Confirmed
The bug is in the `get_chunks` method at line 107 of dataframe.py:
```python
for start in range(0, step * n_chunks, step):
```

When `n_chunks > num_rows`, the calculation `step * n_chunks` exceeds the actual DataFrame size, causing the iteration to create empty DataFrames through `self._df.iloc[start : start + step, :]` where `start` is beyond the DataFrame's bounds.

### Impact
The function always returns exactly `n_chunks` chunks, even when this results in empty chunks. For example:
- With 1 row and 2 chunks requested: returns 2 chunks (1 with data, 1 empty)
- With 5 rows and 10 chunks requested: returns 10 chunks (5 with data, 5 empty)

This wastes computational resources and may cause unexpected behavior in downstream code that doesn't handle empty chunks properly.
