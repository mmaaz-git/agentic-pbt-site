## Triage Analysis for SparseArray.cumsum() Bug Report

### Considering Each Possible Category

#### 1. BUG - Valid bug that should be fixed
**Supporting Evidence:**
- The method crashes with RecursionError for common use cases (integer arrays with default fill_value=0)
- cumsum() is a documented public API method that should work for all valid SparseArrays
- The crash is clearly due to a coding error (infinite recursion) not intentional behavior
- The proposed fix is simple and correct: call cumsum() on the dense array before wrapping in SparseArray
- The method works correctly for null fill values but fails for non-null, showing inconsistent behavior
- Crashes are never acceptable for documented public methods
- The cumulative sum operation has well-defined mathematical semantics that should work for all numeric values

**Against:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

#### 2. INVALID - Incorrect report or expected behavior
**Supporting Evidence:**
- None. The crash is reproducible and clearly wrong.

**Against:**
- The report accurately describes the bug
- The reproduction steps are correct
- The infinite recursion is confirmed
- The proposed fix is technically correct

#### 3. WONTFIX - Trivial or unimportant issue
**Supporting Evidence:**
- None. This is a critical crash in a public API.

**Against:**
- This affects a core public API method (cumsum)
- Crashes are never trivial
- The default SparseArray configuration (fill_value=0) triggers the bug
- This would affect any user trying to use cumsum() on integer sparse arrays

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Documentation is wrong
**Supporting Evidence:**
- None. The documentation correctly describes what the method should do.

**Against:**
- The documentation states cumsum() should compute cumulative sums
- There's no documentation saying it should fail for non-null fill values
- The implementation is wrong, not the documentation

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST - Asking for new functionality
**Supporting Evidence:**
- None. cumsum() is already a documented method.

**Against:**
- cumsum() is an existing public API method
- The user isn't asking for new functionality
- They're reporting that existing functionality crashes
- The expected behavior (computing cumulative sums) is standard

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug is a simple coding error on line 1550:
```python
return SparseArray(self.to_dense()).cumsum()
```

This creates a new SparseArray which still has a non-null fill value, causing it to recursively hit the same code path. The fix is straightforward:
```python
return SparseArray(self.to_dense().cumsum())
```

This correctly computes the cumsum on the dense array first, then wraps the result.

### Impact Assessment

**Severity: HIGH**
- Causes complete failure (crash) of a public API method
- Affects the most common use case (integer arrays with fill_value=0)
- No workaround except manually converting to dense, computing cumsum, then converting back
- Breaks user code that relies on this standard array operation

### Final Assessment

This is unquestionably a **BUG** that should be fixed. The report is:
- Accurate in its description
- Correct in identifying the root cause
- Helpful in providing a working fix
- Well-documented with reproducible test cases

The infinite recursion crash in a public API method for standard use cases is a clear bug that needs to be addressed.
