CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
========================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID
-----------
Why it might be INVALID:
- The error is raised correctly (ValueError is appropriate)
- The validation logic works (invalid values are rejected)

Why it's NOT INVALID:
- The error message is objectively wrong - it displays the wrong information in the wrong places
- This is not a matter of opinion or convention; it's a clear logic error
- The message "methodtype must be one of invalid" is nonsensical

Verdict: NOT INVALID - The bug is real and demonstrable


2. WONTFIX
----------
Why it might be WONTFIX:
- It only affects error messages, not functionality
- The error is still raised, just with a confusing message
- Users rarely encounter this specific validation error

Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
- Error messages are important for developer experience
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a basic validation message
- The fix is trivial (swap two variables)
- Poor error messages lead to confusion and wasted debugging time

Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - Error messages matter for usability


3. FEATURE_REQUEST
------------------
Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could argue that "better error messages" is an enhancement

Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is not requesting new functionality
- The error message already exists, it's just backwards
- This is fixing broken existing behavior, not adding new features

Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is a bug in existing code


4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
--------------------
Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation doesn't specify the exact error message format

Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- No reasonable interpretation of documentation would suggest the error message should be backwards
- The fix needs to be in the code, not in documentation

Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code needs fixing


5. BUG
------
Why it IS a BUG:
- Clear logic error: variables are swapped in the format string
- Error message displays incorrect information
- The message "methodtype must be one of invalid" is objectively wrong
- The intended behavior is obvious from context and convention
- Simple, clear fix exists (swap the variables)
- Affects user experience when debugging
- Reproducible 100% of the time

Why it might NOT be a BUG:
- (No valid reasons - this is clearly a bug)

Verdict: This is a BUG


FINAL ASSESSMENT
================
This is a clear BUG. The error message has swapped variables, resulting in a backwards and confusing message that says "methodtype must be one of [invalid_value]" instead of "methodtype must be one of [valid_values]". This is not a matter of preference or documentation - it's an objective logic error in the code that produces nonsensical output.
