## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function might be behaving as designed if it was only intended to catch type errors and not pattern errors. Perhaps the expectation is that callers should pass valid regex strings and the function only checks if the type is compilable, not the content validity.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function name `is_re_compilable` and its docstring "Check if the object can be compiled into a regex pattern instance" clearly indicate it should check compilability comprehensively. A function that checks if something "can be compiled" should return False for anything that cannot be compiled, not raise an exception. The documented examples support this interpretation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue that invalid regex patterns are edge cases that rarely occur in practice, and users should validate their regex patterns before passing them to pandas functions. The current behavior might be considered acceptable if it's deemed a low-priority issue.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not an obscure edge case - invalid regex patterns are common user errors (mismatched parentheses, escaped characters, etc.). The function is part of the public API and its purpose is specifically to check compilability safely. Crashing on invalid input defeats the entire purpose of having a checking function.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the intended behavior is to only check type validity (not pattern validity), then the documentation should be updated to clarify this limitation. The docstring could specify that it only catches TypeError and that users must ensure regex patterns are syntactically valid.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function name and current documentation strongly imply comprehensive checking. Changing the documentation to match the buggy behavior would make the function less useful and more confusing. The natural expectation from "is_re_compilable" is that it safely checks all aspects of compilability.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
If the original design never intended to handle invalid regex patterns, then adding support for them could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The current implementation might be considered "working as designed" with room for enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already exists with the explicit purpose of checking compilability. Making it actually work for its stated purpose is not a new feature but fixing broken functionality. The docstring promises to check if an object "can be compiled" - fulfilling this promise is not a feature request.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function's name `is_re_compilable` and docstring explicitly state it checks whether an object "can be compiled into a regex pattern." A predicate function (is_*) should never raise exceptions for invalid input - it should return False. The function fails to fulfill its documented contract by crashing on invalid regex patterns instead of returning False. This is a clear violation of the principle of least surprise and the documented behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if there was additional documentation explicitly stating that the function only handles TypeError and expects valid regex syntax, but no such documentation exists. The current implementation could be seen as incomplete rather than incorrect if one argues the original intent was limited.

## Overall Consideration

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function `is_re_compilable` has a single, well-defined purpose: to check if an object can be compiled as a regex pattern and return a boolean result. The name follows the standard `is_*` predicate pattern which universally implies safe checking without exceptions for invalid input. The docstring reinforces this by stating it "checks if the object can be compiled" and returns a boolean.

The current implementation defeats the entire purpose of having this function. Why would anyone use `is_re_compilable` if it can crash just like calling `re.compile` directly? The function exists specifically to provide a safe way to check compilability before attempting compilation. Users would naturally use this function to validate user input or data from external sources where invalid regex patterns are likely.

The fix is trivial and correct - simply catch `re.PatternError` in addition to `TypeError`. This makes the function behave exactly as its name and documentation promise. There's no ambiguity here - a function called `is_re_compilable` that crashes on non-compilable input is fundamentally broken and needs to be fixed.
