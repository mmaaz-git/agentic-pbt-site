## Documentation Analysis for FixedForwardWindowIndexer

### Official Documentation Review

1. **Class Purpose:**
   - Described as "Creates window boundaries for fixed-length windows that include the current row"
   - The name explicitly includes "Forward" indicating forward-looking behavior
   - The documentation example shows forward-looking windows (e.g., row 0 looks at rows 0 and 1)

2. **Parameter Constraints:**
   - The documentation specifies `window_size: int = 0` as the parameter type
   - NO explicit constraint that window_size must be non-negative
   - NO validation in __init__ method - it simply stores: `self.window_size = window_size`
   - The type annotation indicates an integer, but doesn't restrict the sign

3. **Source Code Analysis:**
   The get_window_bounds implementation reveals the issue:
   ```python
   start = np.arange(0, num_values, step, dtype="int64")
   end = start + self.window_size
   if self.window_size:
       end = np.clip(end, 0, num_values)
   ```

   Critical observation: When window_size is negative:
   - `end = start + self.window_size` produces end values less than start values
   - The clipping logic only executes if window_size is non-zero (truthy)
   - For window_size=-1, the clip constrains end to [0, num_values], but doesn't fix the fundamental issue

4. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - The class name "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" semantically implies forward-looking windows
   - A negative window_size would mean looking backward, which contradicts the "Forward" in the name
   - The example in documentation shows window_size=2 creating forward windows

5. **Missing Documentation:**
   - No explicit statement that window_size must be >= 0
   - No documentation of what happens with negative window_size
   - No validation errors mentioned for invalid window_size values

### Conclusion
The documentation does NOT explicitly forbid negative window_size values, but:
1. The semantic meaning of "Forward" strongly implies non-negative windows
2. The implementation clearly produces invalid results with negative values
3. The lack of validation appears to be an oversight rather than intentional support for negative values
4. All examples use positive window_size values
