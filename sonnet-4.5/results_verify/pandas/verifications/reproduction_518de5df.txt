REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
===================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS
The property-based test using Hypothesis confirms the bug:
- The test fails with the assertion error: "lag_plot should reject lag=-1 but it succeeded"
- This demonstrates that lag_plot does not validate negative lag values
- The function accepts negative lag values when it should raise a ValueError

2. MANUAL TEST RESULTS
Running the provided manual test code produced exactly the outputs described in the bug report:

Test with lag=-1:
- Created 1 point (should have raised ValueError)
- Y-axis label: 'y(t + -1)'
- The function accepts lag=-1 and produces a nonsensical single-point plot

Test with lag=0:
- Raised ValueError: x and y must be the same size
- This is an error from matplotlib, not a proper validation error from pandas

3. CODE ANALYSIS
Looking at the implementation in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/misc.py:

```python
def lag_plot(series: Series, lag: int = 1, ax: Axes | None = None, **kwds) -> Axes:
    # workaround because `c='b'` is hardcoded in matplotlib's scatter method
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    kwds.setdefault("c", plt.rcParams["patch.facecolor"])

    data = series.values
    y1 = data[:-lag]  # Line 434
    y2 = data[lag:]   # Line 435
    if ax is None:
        ax = plt.gca()
    ax.set_xlabel("y(t)")
    ax.set_ylabel(f"y(t + {lag})")
    ax.scatter(y1, y2, **kwds)
    return ax
```

The bug occurs because:
- When lag=-1, `data[:-(-1)]` becomes `data[:1]` (first element only)
- When lag=-1, `data[-1:]` gives the last element only
- This produces a single point plot which is meaningless
- When lag=0, `data[:-0]` becomes `data[:0]` (empty array) and `data[0:]` gives full array
- This causes a size mismatch error from matplotlib

CONCLUSION
The bug is fully reproducible. The function does not validate the lag parameter and accepts invalid values (lag <= 0) that produce nonsensical or error-prone results.
