## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug as reported. Here are my findings:

### Direct Test Case Results

When testing the specific failing case with pattern '[':
- **Actual behavior**: The function raises `re.PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0`
- **Expected behavior**: The function should return `False`

Testing all invalid regex patterns mentioned in the report confirms the bug:
- Pattern '[' raises: re.PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0
- Pattern '(' raises: re.PatternError: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0
- Pattern ')' raises: re.PatternError: unbalanced parenthesis at position 0
- Pattern '?' raises: re.PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Pattern '*' raises: re.PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Pattern '+' raises: re.PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
- Pattern '\' raises: re.PatternError: bad escape (end of pattern) at position 0

### Hypothesis Test Results

The Hypothesis property-based test found 7 distinct failures when testing 500 random strings:
1. '\C' - bad escape \C at position 0
2. '\1' - invalid group reference 1 at position 1
3. '\p' - bad escape \p at position 0
4. '[' - unterminated character set at position 0
5. '(' - missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0
6. ')' - unbalanced parenthesis at position 0
7. '?' - nothing to repeat at position 0

All of these failures resulted in `re.PatternError` being raised by `is_re_compilable`, which should have been caught and returned as `False`.

### Source Code Analysis

The current implementation in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/dtypes/inference.py` (lines 187-192) is:

```python
def is_re_compilable(obj) -> bool:
    try:
        re.compile(obj)
    except TypeError:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

The function only catches `TypeError` (for non-string objects like integers) but does not catch `re.PatternError` which is raised by `re.compile()` for invalid regex patterns.

### Impact

The function is used in production code, specifically in `pandas/core/array_algos/replace.py` where line 38 shows:
```python
regex = regex and is_re_compilable(to_replace)
```

This means any code path using string replacement with regex may crash when given invalid regex patterns, when the expectation is that the function would gracefully return `False` and disable regex mode.

### Conclusion

The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The function fails to handle `re.PatternError` exceptions, causing crashes instead of returning `False` for invalid regex patterns.
