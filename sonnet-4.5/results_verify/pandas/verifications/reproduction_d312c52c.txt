   - The reproduction confirms the exact behavior described
   - The function does exactly what the source code shows:
     * Check if Saturday (weekday 5): add 2 days
     * Check if Sunday (weekday 6): add 1 day
     * Otherwise: return unchanged

8. Use Case Context:
   - Function is used for holiday observance in business contexts
   - When a holiday falls on weekend, it's observed on Monday
   - When a holiday falls on weekday, it's observed on that day
   - This is standard U.S. federal holiday observance behavior
