## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug in scipy.signal.windows.tukey that violates the symmetry guarantee when sym=True for very small alpha values.

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
Running the provided property-based test with Hypothesis immediately found a failing case:
- M=2, alpha=2.8429516001933894e-89
- The test correctly identified that the window is not symmetric when it should be

### Minimal Example Reproduction
The minimal example provided in the bug report was verified:
- Input: M=2, alpha=1e-300, sym=True
- Expected output: A symmetric window
- Actual output: [0. 1.] which is NOT symmetric (reversed is [1. 0.])

### Additional Testing
Tested with various alpha values to identify the threshold where the bug occurs:
- alpha >= 1e-10: Window is correctly symmetric [0. 0.]
- alpha < 1e-50: Window becomes asymmetric [0. 1.]

### Root Cause Verification
Through detailed calculation analysis, I confirmed the exact mechanism of the bug:
1. For very small alpha (e.g., 1e-300), the calculation involves extremely large terms:
   - -2.0/alpha ≈ -2e+300
   - 2.0*n3/alpha/(M-1) ≈ 2e+300

2. Due to Python's left-to-right evaluation of the expression:
   (-2.0/alpha + 1 + 2.0*n3/alpha/(M-1))
   The intermediate calculation becomes:
   - Step 1: -2e+300 + 1 = -2e+300 (the +1 is lost due to floating-point precision)
   - Step 2: -2e+300 + 2e+300 = 0 (catastrophic cancellation)

3. This yields cos(0) = 1 instead of cos(π) = -1, resulting in w3[0] = 1.0 instead of 0.0

The bug is consistently reproducible and the mechanism is well understood.
