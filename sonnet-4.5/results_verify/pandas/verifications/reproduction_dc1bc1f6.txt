BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for pandas.tseries.frequencies functions is_subperiod() and is_superperiod(). The bug involves a symmetry violation between these two functions.

REPRODUCTION RESULTS:
--------------------

1. Hypothesis Test:
   - The property-based test using hypothesis confirmed the bug
   - Falsifying example: source='D', target='B'
   - The test failed with: "Symmetry broken: is_subperiod(D, B) = False, but is_superperiod(B, D) = True"

2. Simple Reproduction:
   - Direct calls to the functions confirmed the asymmetry:
     * is_subperiod('D', 'B') returns False
     * is_superperiod('B', 'D') returns True
   - These values should be equal according to the symmetry property

3. Extended Testing:
   - Tested multiple frequency pairs to understand the scope:
     * D -> B: is_sub=False, is_super(reverse)=True ✗ (BROKEN)
     * B -> D: is_sub=False, is_super(reverse)=True ✗ (BROKEN)
     * Most other frequency pairs maintain proper symmetry (D->h, h->D, D->W, W->D, etc.)

4. Actual Resampling Test:
   - CRITICAL FINDING: Pandas DOES support resampling between D and B in both directions
   - Successfully resampled from D to B (daily to business day) using daily_data.resample('B')
   - Successfully resampled from B to D (business to daily) using business_data.resample('D')
   - This proves that both downsampling (D to B) and upsampling (B to D) are valid operations

IMPACT:
-------
The bug causes is_subperiod('D', 'B') to incorrectly return False when it should return True, since:
1. Resampling from D to B is demonstrably possible in pandas
2. The inverse function is_superperiod('B', 'D') correctly returns True
3. The symmetry property that should exist between these functions is violated

This is a legitimate logic bug in the implementation of is_subperiod() that fails to properly recognize the valid relationship between daily and business day frequencies.
