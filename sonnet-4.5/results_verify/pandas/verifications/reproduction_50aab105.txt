## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the reported issue in pandas.compat.numpy.function ARGSORT_DEFAULTS.

### Verification Steps Taken:

1. **Ran the reproduction code**: Confirmed that ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["kind"] is indeed None, not "quicksort"
   - Output showed all keys in the dictionary, with "kind" set to None

2. **Examined the source code**: Verified the duplicate assignment exists at lines 138 and 140:
   - Line 138: ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["kind"] = "quicksort"
   - Line 140: ARGSORT_DEFAULTS["kind"] = None

3. **Ran the property-based test**: The test passes, confirming that the final value is None

### Effect of the Bug:

The duplicate assignment means:
- Line 138's assignment of "quicksort" is immediately overwritten by line 140's assignment of None
- This results in dead code on line 138 that serves no purpose
- The final dictionary has "kind" = None, which appears to be the intended behavior based on the comments

### Context from Source Code:

The comments at lines 148-149 clarify there are two different validators:
- ARGSORT_DEFAULTS: Used when the 'kind' parameter is NOT supported (should have kind=None)
- ARGSORT_DEFAULTS_KIND: Used when the 'kind' parameter IS supported (doesn't have a 'kind' key at all)

This context suggests line 138 is indeed incorrect and should be removed, as ARGSORT_DEFAULTS is meant for cases where 'kind' is not supported.
