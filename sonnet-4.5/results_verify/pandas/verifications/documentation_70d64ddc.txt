## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

I reviewed the official pandas documentation for both `read_clipboard()` and `to_clipboard()` functions.

### Key Findings

1. **Encoding Parameter Not Documented:**
   - Neither function's documentation explicitly mentions an `encoding` parameter
   - The documentation does not specify that only UTF-8 encoding is supported
   - There is no mention of what exceptions are raised when invalid encodings are provided

2. **Exception Types Not Specified:**
   - The documentation does not specify what exception types these functions raise
   - No mention of NotImplementedError or ValueError in relation to encoding validation
   - No guidance on error handling for encoding-related issues

3. **Internal Implementation Details:**
   - The source code shows both functions accept an `encoding` parameter via kwargs
   - Both functions validate this parameter with identical logic
   - The validation is an internal implementation detail not exposed in the documentation

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation has several gaps:
1. Does not document the `encoding` parameter that both functions accept
2. Does not specify that only UTF-8 encoding is supported
3. Does not document what exceptions are raised for unsupported encodings
4. Does not provide guidance on exception handling

### Implications for Bug Triage

Since the documentation:
- Does not specify what exception type should be raised for unsupported encodings
- Does not even document that these functions accept an encoding parameter
- Does not establish any contract about encoding validation behavior

The inconsistency in exception types is an **internal implementation detail** that is not part of the documented API contract. However, the fact that both functions perform identical validation but raise different exceptions is still a consistency issue that affects users who discover and use this undocumented parameter.
