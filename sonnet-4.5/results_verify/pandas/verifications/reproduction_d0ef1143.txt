# Reproduction of the Bug

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in `pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer`. The function returns negative values in multiple cases where it should return non-negative values representing the length of an indexed result.

## Test Results

### 1. Hypothesis Test Execution
The provided Hypothesis test failed immediately, finding a failure case:
- Input: `slice(None, None, -1)` on array of length 1
- Computed length: -1
- Actual length: 1

### 2. Bug Report's Specific Case
The specific case from the bug report was confirmed:
- Input: `slice(1, 0, None)` on array `[0]`
- Computed length: -1
- Actual length (from `len(target[indexer])`): 0
- This is an empty slice where start > stop, which should have length 0

### 3. Additional Cases Found
Through extended testing, I found multiple cases where negative lengths are returned:

1. **Empty slice (start > stop)**: `slice(1, 0, None)` returns -1 instead of 0
2. **Negative to positive empty**: `slice(-1, 0, None)` returns -4 instead of 0
3. **Full reverse slice**: `slice(None, None, -1)` returns -5 for array of length 5 (should be 5)
4. **Single element reverse**: `slice(None, None, -1)` returns -1 for array of length 1 (should be 1)
5. **Out of bounds indices**: `slice(10, 20, None)` on array of length 3 returns -7 instead of 0

## Confirmation of the Bug
The bug is confirmed. The function `length_of_indexer` is returning negative values in cases where:
1. The slice is empty (no elements selected)
2. The slice has negative step values
3. The indices are out of bounds

A length, by definition, cannot be negative - it represents a count of elements. The function's docstring states it should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]", and the actual length when indexing an array with these slices is always non-negative.
