BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
=========================

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### 1. INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly specify behavior for start > stop
- Could argue this is undefined behavior

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The method name "slice_replace" directly references Python slicing
- Python slicing has well-defined behavior for start > stop (returns empty slice)
- The implementation attempts to handle this case but does so incorrectly
- The expectation that text[:start] + repl + text[stop:] should work is reasonable

**Verdict: NOT INVALID**

### 2. WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Start > stop could be considered an edge case
- Users might not commonly use reversed indices

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental slicing operation
- The bug causes data loss (loses part of the string)
- The fix is simple and doesn't break existing correct behavior
- Python developers expect consistent slicing semantics

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX**

### 3. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that support for start > stop is a new feature
- Documentation doesn't promise this behavior

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The code already attempts to handle start > stop cases (lines 352-355)
- The implementation exists but is buggy, not missing
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- Basic slicing semantics should work consistently

**Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST**

### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could document that start > stop is not supported
- Could add examples showing the current behavior

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code is objectively wrong based on Python slicing semantics
- The implementation tries to handle empty slices but does so incorrectly
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
- The fix addresses the root cause, not just documentation

**Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX**

### 5. BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
- The method produces incorrect results that violate Python slicing semantics
- The implementation contains flawed logic (setting local_stop = start for empty slices)
- Data is lost in the output (missing the text[stop:] portion)
- The behavior is inconsistent with user expectations based on Python's slice behavior
- The bug is reproducible and affects all cases where start > stop
- The proposed fix is correct and simple
- This breaks the principle of least surprise for Python developers

**Verdict: CLEARLY A BUG**

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** that should be fixed. The implementation incorrectly handles cases where start > stop, producing results that violate Python's standard slicing semantics. The bug causes data loss and unexpected behavior. The fix is straightforward and corrects the flawed logic in the current implementation.
