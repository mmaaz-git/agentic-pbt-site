# Documentation Analysis for ensure_python_int

## Documentation Status
The function `ensure_python_int` is NOT documented in the official pandas public API documentation, despite being exported in the module's `__all__` list.

## Function Location and Interface
- Location: `/pandas/core/dtypes/common.py`
- Exported: Yes (included in `__all__` list)
- Used internally: Yes, primarily by `pandas.core.indexes.range.RangeIndex`

## Function Documentation (from docstring)
```python
def ensure_python_int(value: int | np.integer) -> int:
    """
    Ensure that a value is a python int.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value: int or numpy.integer

    Returns
    -------
    int

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError: if the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one.
    """
```

## Key Documentation Findings

### 1. Type Contract is Clear
The function signature and docstring are unambiguous:
- **Input**: `int | np.integer` (Python int or numpy integer types ONLY)
- **Output**: `int` (Python int)
- **Raises**: `TypeError` if value isn't an int or can't be converted

### 2. No Mention of Float Support
The documentation makes NO mention of:
- Accepting float types
- Converting integer-valued floats (like 5.0) to int
- Handling precision loss for large floats
- Any special float handling behavior

### 3. Internal vs Public Status
- The function IS exported (`__all__` list includes it)
- But it's NOT documented in the public pandas API docs
- This creates ambiguity about whether it's truly "public"
- It's used internally by RangeIndex for parameter validation

### 4. Docstring vs Implementation Mismatch
The docstring clearly states the function should:
- Accept only `int` or `numpy.integer` types
- Raise TypeError for anything else

But the implementation:
- Also accepts floats via `is_float(value)` check
- Attempts to convert floats to int
- Only raises TypeError if the conversion changes the value

## Conclusion on Documentation
The documentation (both type signature and docstring) is CLEAR and CORRECT about what the function should do. The implementation is what deviates from the documented behavior. This is not a documentation bug - it's an implementation bug where the code doesn't match its documented contract.

The fact that this function is:
1. Exported in `__all__`
2. Has a clear docstring
3. Has explicit type annotations

Means that users and type checkers have every right to expect it to behave as documented (rejecting floats). The current implementation violates this contract.
