TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
- The documentation explicitly states "file format is inferred from file extension"
- "File extension" has a precise technical meaning (suffix after last period)
- The implementation uses substring matching which contradicts the documentation
- This causes real-world problems for users with backup files or versioned files
- The behavior is counterintuitive and surprising
- Files like "data.xpt.backup" should not be detected as xport files
- The proposed fix is simple and correct (using endswith() instead of 'in')

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. The documentation is clear and the implementation is wrong.

### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Bug Report)

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
- Could argue that substring matching is "more flexible"
- Could argue users should know not to have .xpt in filenames

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation specifically says "file extension" not "contains extension"
- File extension has a precise technical definition
- Many valid use cases exist for files like "data.xpt.backup"
- The current behavior is objectively wrong per the documentation

### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
- Users can work around by explicitly specifying format parameter
- Might argue this is an edge case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not trivial - it affects real users with backup/versioned files
- The fix is simple and improves correctness
- Backup files and versioned files are common in data science workflows
- Silent incorrect behavior is never trivial

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue the current behavior is "as designed"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation already promises this behavior
- This is fixing a bug, not adding a new feature
- The expected behavior is already documented

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Wrong)

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could change documentation to say "contains extension string"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documented behavior is the correct and expected behavior
- Changing docs to match the buggy implementation would be wrong
- Every other file I/O function uses proper extension checking
- The current implementation is clearly a mistake/oversight

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The implementation directly contradicts the documented behavior. The documentation promises to check "file extension" (a term with precise technical meaning), but the code checks for substring containment instead. This causes real problems for users with common filename patterns like backup files.

The bug is:
1. Well-defined (documentation vs implementation mismatch)
2. Reproducible (confirmed with multiple test cases)
3. Impactful (affects real use cases)
4. Fixable (simple change from 'in' to 'endswith()')

No reasonable interpretation of the documentation would lead a user to expect that "data.xpt.backup" would be treated as an xport file.
