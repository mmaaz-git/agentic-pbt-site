## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError.__init__.

### Test Execution

1. **Direct Reproduction**: I ran the provided reproduction script and confirmed the error message has swapped arguments:
   - Actual output: "methodtype must be one of invalid, got {'method', 'classmethod', 'property', 'staticmethod'} instead."
   - Expected output: "methodtype must be one of {'method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', 'property'}, got invalid instead."

2. **Property-Based Test**: I ran a simplified version of the Hypothesis test with input '0' and confirmed:
   - The invalid value '0' appears in the first part of the error message ("methodtype must be one of 0")
   - This is incorrect - the valid types should appear there instead

3. **Source Code Verification**: I examined the source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/errors/__init__.py` line 298:
   ```python
   raise ValueError(
       f"methodtype must be one of {methodtype}, got {types} instead."
   )
   ```
   This confirms the bug - the f-string has `{methodtype}` and `{types}` in the wrong positions.

### Effect of the Bug

The bug creates confusing error messages that mislead users about what values are acceptable. When a user passes an invalid methodtype, they see an error suggesting that "methodtype must be one of [their invalid input]" which is backwards and unhelpful. The error message should clearly state what the valid options are.

This is a clear usability issue that affects the clarity of error messages, which are crucial for developers to understand what went wrong.
