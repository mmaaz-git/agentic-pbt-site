BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluation of each possible category:

1. INVALID
----------
Reasons it might be INVALID:
- None found

Reasons against INVALID:
- The function clearly violates its documented contract
- The documentation states it returns a bool, but it raises exceptions
- The function name "is_re_compilable" semantically implies a safe boolean check
- The current behavior contradicts user expectations based on documentation

Verdict: NOT INVALID - The bug report is correct about the discrepancy

2. WONTFIX
----------
Reasons it might be WONTFIX:
- None - this is not an obscure edge case

Reasons against WONTFIX:
- This affects common invalid regex patterns like '[', '(', '*', etc.
- These are not obscure inputs - they can easily occur in user data
- The function's purpose is specifically to safely check if something is compilable
- Breaking the documented contract is not a trivial issue

Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - This is a meaningful bug affecting normal usage

3. FEATURE_REQUEST
------------------
Reasons it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
- None - the expected behavior is already documented

Reasons against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- The documentation already promises boolean returns
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The bug report is about fixing existing broken functionality

Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - The functionality already exists but is broken

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
--------------------
Reasons it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- One could argue the documentation should mention that exceptions can be raised

Reasons against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The function's semantic purpose is to be a safe checker
- The name "is_re_compilable" strongly implies boolean returns
- Changing docs to say "may raise exceptions" would contradict the function's purpose
- The code implementation appears to be attempting to catch exceptions (just missing one)
- The fix is trivial (add re.error to the except clause)

Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code should be fixed, not the documentation

5. BUG
------
Reasons it IS a BUG:
- Function raises exceptions when documentation promises boolean returns
- The implementation already tries to catch exceptions (TypeError) but misses re.error
- The function's purpose is to safely check compilability without raising exceptions
- The proposed fix is simple and correct: catch re.error in addition to TypeError
- Invalid regex patterns are valid inputs to check for compilability
- The current behavior breaks the contract established by the documentation

Reasons against BUG:
- None found

Verdict: THIS IS A BUG

CONCLUSION
----------
This is a clear BUG. The function violates its documented contract by raising exceptions instead of returning False for invalid regex patterns. The implementation appears to be an oversight where the developer caught TypeError but forgot to catch re.error/re.PatternError which re.compile() can also raise.
