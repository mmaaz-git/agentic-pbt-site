## Documentation Analysis for ensure_python_int

### Function Location and Nature
The function `ensure_python_int` is located in `pandas.core.dtypes.common` and is an internal pandas function (not part of the public API documented on pandas.pydata.org). This is significant because internal functions often have less rigorous documentation requirements than public API functions.

### Documented Contract
The function's docstring states:

```
Ensure that a value is a python int.

Parameters
----------
value: int or numpy.integer

Returns
-------
int

Raises
------
TypeError: if the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one.
```

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Explicit Contract**: The documentation explicitly states that the function should raise `TypeError` when "the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one."

2. **Input Types**: The parameter documentation says it accepts "int or numpy.integer" but the actual implementation also accepts floats (as seen from lines 109-110 where it checks `is_float(value)`).

3. **Conversion Attempt**: The documentation implies the function will attempt conversion with the phrase "can't be converted to one", suggesting it tries to convert valid inputs.

4. **Single Exception Type**: The documentation specifies only ONE exception type should be raised: `TypeError`. There is no mention of `OverflowError`, `ValueError`, or any other exception types.

### Python's int() Behavior
Python's built-in `int()` function raises different exceptions for different error conditions:
- `OverflowError` for infinity values (float('inf'), float('-inf'))
- `ValueError` for NaN values
- `TypeError` for truly incompatible types

### Documentation Interpretation
The documentation is clear and unambiguous: ANY failure to convert to int should result in a `TypeError`. The phrase "can't be converted to one" encompasses all conversion failures, including overflow situations. The documentation does not make exceptions for specific edge cases or allow for other error types to propagate.
