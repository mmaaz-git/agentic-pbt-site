## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is in pandas.core.dtypes.common which is a PRIVATE module not part of the public API. Users should not be relying on internal functions, and the behavior of internal functions is not guaranteed. Additionally, one could argue that raising OverflowError for infinity is actually more precise and informative than TypeError, as it tells the caller exactly what went wrong (overflow) rather than a generic type error.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function has explicit documentation in its docstring that states it raises TypeError "if the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one." The docstring creates a clear contract that is being violated. Even internal functions should follow their documented behavior for code maintainability and consistency.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal function in a private module (pandas.core) that users shouldn't be directly importing. The different exception types (OverflowError vs TypeError) both inherit from Exception and serve the same purpose of indicating conversion failure. The practical impact is minimal since both exceptions indicate the conversion failed. Most code would catch Exception or not catch at all, making the specific exception type irrelevant.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The function already handles ValueError correctly by converting it to TypeError for NaN values, showing that exception type consistency was intentional. The inconsistency with infinity values appears to be an oversight rather than intentional design. The fix is trivial (adding OverflowError to the caught exceptions) and improves consistency.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue the documentation should be updated to reflect the actual behavior: "Raises TypeError for most conversion failures, OverflowError for infinity values." This would document the existing behavior rather than changing code. The current implementation provides more granular error information which could be seen as beneficial.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The implementation already shows clear intent to normalize all conversion failures to TypeError - it catches ValueError and AssertionError and converts them. The omission of OverflowError appears to be a bug, not intentional behavior worth documenting. Documenting exceptions inconsistently raised would make the API harder to use correctly.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Currently the function provides different exception types for different failure modes, which gives callers more information. Adding consistent TypeError for all failures could be seen as a new feature for simplified exception handling. The request is essentially asking for enhanced exception normalization.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The docstring already promises this behavior - it's not a new feature but fixing existing documented behavior. The function already implements exception normalization for ValueError and AssertionError, just incompletely. This is fixing a bug in existing functionality, not adding new capability.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function's docstring explicitly states it raises TypeError "if the value isn't an int or can't be converted to one" with no exceptions mentioned. The code already catches and converts ValueError to TypeError, showing clear intent for exception normalization. The omission of OverflowError from the caught exceptions appears to be an oversight. The fix is trivial and makes the function behavior consistent with its documentation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an internal function in pandas.core which is not part of the public API. Users shouldn't be importing from pandas.core.dtypes.common directly. The different exception type (OverflowError) is actually more informative about what went wrong. Many would argue internal implementation details don't constitute bugs unless they affect public API behavior.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a valid BUG report, though it's a close call given the internal nature of the function. The key factors are:

First, the docstring creates an explicit contract that the function raises TypeError for ANY value that "isn't an int or can't be converted to one." There are no caveats or exceptions mentioned. When infinity is passed, it certainly "can't be converted to" an int, so per the documentation, it should raise TypeError. The documentation is clear and unambiguous on this point.

Second, the implementation already demonstrates intent to normalize exceptions - it catches ValueError (raised by int(nan)) and converts it to TypeError. This shows the developer intended to provide consistent TypeError for all conversion failures. The omission of OverflowError appears to be an oversight rather than intentional design, especially since OverflowError is semantically similar to ValueError in this context (both indicate conversion failure).

Third, while the function is in a private module, it's still used internally within pandas, and having functions behave according to their docstrings is important for code maintainability. Other pandas code relying on this function might expect TypeError and not handle OverflowError. The proposed fix is minimal, correct, and improves consistency without any negative side effects. This makes it a legitimate bug worth fixing rather than dismissing as WONTFIX or INVALID.
