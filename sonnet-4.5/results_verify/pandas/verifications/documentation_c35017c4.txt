## Documentation Analysis for NaTType and NAType

### Official Documentation Review

1. **NaTType Documentation**:
   - The help documentation describes NaTType as "(N)ot-(A)-(T)ime, the time equivalent of NaN"
   - No explicit documentation states that NaTType() constructor should return a singleton
   - No explicit documentation states that NaTType() should create new instances
   - The documentation shows examples using `pd.NaT` directly, not `NaTType()` constructor

2. **NAType Documentation**:
   - Describes NA as "NA ('not available') missing value indicator"
   - Explicitly states: "The NA singleton is a missing value indicator defined by pandas"
   - Uses the word "singleton" directly in the documentation
   - Examples show using `pd.NA` directly, not `NAType()` constructor

3. **pandas.api.typing Module Context**:
   - These types were moved to `pandas.api.typing` as of pandas 2.1 to provide a public API for type hinting
   - GitHub issue #53934 indicates they were moved for use in `pandas-stubs` for type checking
   - GitHub issue #54028 indicates these types lack proper documentation about their purpose and usage

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No Constructor Usage Guidelines**:
   - Neither NaTType nor NAType documentation specifies whether their constructors should be used directly
   - No documentation explicitly states that constructors should return singletons

2. **Purpose of Types in pandas.api.typing**:
   - The documentation doesn't clarify if these are meant for:
     - Type annotations only
     - Direct instantiation
     - Both purposes

3. **Behavioral Consistency**:
   - No documentation explicitly states that NAType() and NaTType() should behave consistently
   - No documentation explains the singleton pattern implementation difference

### Documentation Findings

The documentation does NOT explicitly specify that:
1. NaTType() constructor should return the pd.NaT singleton
2. NaTType() and NAType() constructors should behave consistently
3. These constructors are meant to be called directly by users

However, the documentation DOES indicate:
1. NAType is explicitly described as a "singleton"
2. Both types are in pandas.api.typing for type hinting purposes
3. Examples always use pd.NA and pd.NaT directly, never the constructors

### Conclusion

The documentation is ambiguous about constructor behavior. While NAType is explicitly called a singleton, there's no similar statement for NaTType. The lack of clear documentation about constructor usage patterns leaves the expected behavior undefined. This could be classified as either a documentation issue or an implementation inconsistency.
