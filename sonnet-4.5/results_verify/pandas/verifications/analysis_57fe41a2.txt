## Bug Report Analysis

### Considering BUG Classification
**Arguments For:**
- The docstring explicitly promises `TypeError` for values that "can't be converted to one"
- Infinity mathematically cannot be converted to an integer
- The function already catches and wraps other exceptions (TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError) as TypeError
- The fix is trivial - just add OverflowError to the caught exceptions
- This is a clear violation of the documented API contract

**Arguments Against:**
- None identified - this appears to be a straightforward bug

### Considering INVALID Classification
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that OverflowError is a more specific/descriptive error than TypeError
- Some might consider OverflowError a subtype of "can't convert" errors

**Arguments Against:**
- The docstring explicitly promises TypeError, not "TypeError or OverflowError"
- The function already wraps other exceptions as TypeError, showing clear intent
- Documentation contracts should be honored precisely
- Users relying on exception handling would have their code break

### Considering WONTFIX Classification
**Arguments For:**
- This is an edge case with infinity values
- Might be considered low priority since infinity isn't a common input
- The current error is still informative (OverflowError)

**Arguments Against:**
- The fix is trivial (one-line change)
- It's a clear contract violation
- Property-based testing found this issue, suggesting it's worth fixing
- Consistent error handling improves API reliability

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification
**Arguments For:**
- Could update the docstring to say "raises TypeError or OverflowError"
- Could argue the documentation should match the implementation

**Arguments Against:**
- The function already demonstrates intent to wrap exceptions as TypeError
- Changing documentation instead of code would be backwards
- The code pattern shows clear intent to normalize all conversion failures to TypeError
- Other caught exceptions are already wrapped, so OverflowError should be too

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST Classification
**Arguments For:**
- None - this isn't requesting new functionality

**Arguments Against:**
- The docstring already promises this behavior
- This is fixing existing functionality to match documentation
- Not a new feature but a bug fix

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has a documented contract that promises to raise `TypeError` for values that can't be converted to int. Infinity cannot be converted to int, yet the function raises `OverflowError` instead of the promised `TypeError`. The implementation already shows clear intent to wrap conversion errors as `TypeError` (catching TypeError, ValueError, and AssertionError), but simply missed `OverflowError` in the exception list. The fix is trivial and aligns the implementation with its documented behavior.
