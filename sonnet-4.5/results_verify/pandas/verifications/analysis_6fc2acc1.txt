## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### BUG - Arguments For:
1. **Violates Fundamental Invariant**: The code produces window bounds where start > end, which is mathematically invalid and breaks the basic contract of window indexing.
2. **Silent Failure**: The class accepts negative window_size without error but produces incorrect results that would cause downstream failures.
3. **Implementation Bug**: The algorithm clearly wasn't designed to handle negative values - it clips negative end values to 0 while start continues incrementing.
4. **Real Impact**: This would cause actual failures in production code using rolling window operations.
5. **Clear Fix Available**: Adding input validation would prevent the issue entirely.

### INVALID - Arguments For:
1. **Semantic Nonsense**: "FixedForwardWindowIndexer" with negative window_size is conceptually meaningless - you can't look "forward" by a negative amount.
2. **Undocumented Behavior**: The documentation never suggests negative values are supported.
3. **User Error**: Passing negative window_size to a forward-looking indexer is likely a programming error.

### INVALID - Arguments Against:
1. **No Explicit Prohibition**: The documentation doesn't explicitly state negative values are forbidden.
2. **Accepts Invalid Input**: The code accepts the value without raising an error, suggesting it should handle it properly.
3. **Produces Wrong Output**: Rather than raising an error for unsupported input, it produces mathematically invalid output.

### WONTFIX - Arguments For:
1. **Edge Case**: Negative window sizes for a forward indexer make no semantic sense and would likely never occur in real code.
2. **User Responsibility**: Users should know not to pass negative values to a forward-looking window.

### WONTFIX - Arguments Against:
1. **Not Obscure**: Window size is a primary parameter, not some edge case.
2. **Silent Corruption**: The bug causes silent data corruption rather than an obvious error.
3. **Easy to Fix**: Adding validation is trivial and prevents the issue.

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments For:
1. **Input Validation Missing**: Could be seen as requesting a new feature to validate inputs.
2. **Error Handling**: Requesting better error messages for invalid inputs.

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments Against:
1. **Not New Functionality**: This isn't asking for new capabilities, but fixing broken behavior.
2. **Bug Not Enhancement**: Producing start > end is clearly incorrect behavior, not a missing feature.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments For:
1. **Missing Constraints**: Documentation doesn't specify that window_size must be non-negative.
2. **Could Document Limitation**: Could simply document that negative values are not supported.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments Against:
1. **Code is Wrong**: The issue isn't that documentation is unclear, it's that the code produces invalid output.
2. **Fundamental Invariant**: start <= end is such a basic requirement it shouldn't need documentation.

### Analysis Summary

This is a clear case where:
1. The code accepts input it cannot handle correctly
2. Produces mathematically invalid output (start > end)
3. Violates fundamental invariants of window indexing
4. Would cause real failures in production code
5. Has a simple, obvious fix (input validation)

While negative window_size for a "Forward" indexer is semantically questionable, the fact that the code accepts it without error but then produces invalid output makes this a legitimate bug. The code should either:
- Reject negative values with a clear error message (preferred), OR
- Handle them correctly if they're meant to be supported

Since it does neither, this is a BUG.
