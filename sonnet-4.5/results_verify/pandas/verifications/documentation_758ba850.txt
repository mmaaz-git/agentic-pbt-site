## Documentation Analysis for Cython.Plex.Regexps.Range

### Function Docstring
The Range function in Cython/Plex/Regexps.py has the following documentation:

```
Range(c1, c2) is an RE which matches any single character in the range
|c1| to |c2| inclusive.
Range(s) where |s| is a string of even length is an RE which matches
any single character in the ranges |s[0]| to |s[1]|, |s[2]| to |s[3]|,...
```

### Key Documentation Points:

1. **Two-argument form**: `Range(c1, c2)` - Creates a regular expression matching any character from c1 to c2 inclusive.

2. **Single-argument form**: `Range(s)` - Requires a string of EVEN LENGTH. This is explicitly documented in the docstring.

3. **Even-length requirement**: The docstring clearly states "where |s| is a string of even length", which means this is a documented requirement, not an optional feature.

4. **Behavior with even-length string**: When provided with an even-length string, it creates multiple character ranges by pairing characters: s[0] to s[1], s[2] to s[3], etc.

### Documentation Clarity:
The documentation is clear that the single-argument form REQUIRES an even-length string. The notation "|s| is a string of even length" explicitly documents this precondition. This is not ambiguous - it's a stated requirement of the function.

### External Documentation:
Web searches did not yield additional external documentation about this specific function beyond what's in the source code itself. The function appears to be an internal part of Cython's Plex lexical analyzer module, used for building regular expressions for lexical analysis.

### Conclusion:
The documentation clearly specifies that when Range is called with a single string argument, that string must have even length. The current implementation does not validate this requirement, leading to an IndexError when an odd-length string is provided, rather than a more descriptive error message.
