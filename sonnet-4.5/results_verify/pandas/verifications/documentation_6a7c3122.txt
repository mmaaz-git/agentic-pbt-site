## Documentation Analysis for convert_to_line_delimits

### Official Documentation
The function `convert_to_line_delimits` is an internal helper function in the pandas library, located in `pandas/io/json/_normalize.py`. It is NOT part of the public API and is not documented in the official pandas documentation.

### Function Docstring
The function has a minimal docstring:
```
Helper function that converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON.
```

### Key Observations

1. **Internal Function**: This is an internal, private function in the pandas library. It's part of the `_normalize` module (note the underscore prefix indicating it's private).

2. **Limited Documentation**: The docstring only states it "converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON" but does not specify:
   - What constitutes a valid JSON list
   - What happens with non-list inputs
   - What the exact criteria are for determining if something is a JSON list
   - Whether it should handle malformed JSON

3. **Comment in Code**: The code has a comment that provides slightly more detail:
   ```python
   # Determine we have a JSON list to turn to lines otherwise just return the
   # json object, only lists can
   ```
   This comment suggests the function is supposed to:
   - Determine if the input is a JSON list
   - If it is a list, convert it to line-delimited format
   - If it's not a list, return it unchanged
   - Only lists should be converted

4. **No Specification for Edge Cases**: The documentation doesn't specify behavior for:
   - Malformed JSON (e.g., `'{"a": 1}]'` or `'[1, 2, 3}'`)
   - Empty strings
   - Non-JSON text
   - Strings that look like arrays but aren't valid JSON

5. **Implementation Intent**: Based on the comment and docstring, the clear intent is to:
   - Process JSON arrays (things starting with '[' and ending with ']')
   - Leave everything else unchanged

The documentation and code comments clearly indicate this function should only process JSON arrays and leave everything else unchanged. The current implementation fails to achieve this documented intent.
