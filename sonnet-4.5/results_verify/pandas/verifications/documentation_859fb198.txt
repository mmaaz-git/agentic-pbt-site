DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR BooleanArray any()/all() METHODS

1. CLASS DOCSTRING:
   BooleanArray docstring clearly states: "BooleanArray implements Kleene logic (sometimes called three-value logic) for logical operations."

2. METHOD DOCUMENTATION FOR any():
   The documentation explicitly describes the behavior:
   - Default parameter: skipna=True
   - When skipna=True: "If the entire array is NA and skipna is True, then the result will be False, as for an empty array."
   - When skipna=False: "If skipna is False, the result will still be True if there is at least one element that is truthy, otherwise NA will be returned if there are NA's present."

   Examples from the documentation:
   >>> pd.array([pd.NA], dtype="boolean").any()  # Returns False (documented)
   >>> pd.array([pd.NA], dtype="boolean").any(skipna=False)  # Returns <NA>

3. METHOD DOCUMENTATION FOR all():
   - Default parameter: skipna=True
   - When skipna=True: "If the entire array is NA and skipna is True, then the result will be True, as for an empty array."
   - When skipna=False: "If skipna is False, the result will still be False if there is at least one element that is falsey, otherwise NA will be returned if there are NA's present."

   Examples from the documentation:
   >>> pd.array([pd.NA], dtype="boolean").all()  # Returns True (documented)
   >>> pd.array([pd.NA], dtype="boolean").all(skipna=False)  # Returns <NA>

4. KLEENE LOGIC REFERENCE:
   While the class claims to implement Kleene logic, the documentation of any()/all() methods clearly states that:
   - With skipna=True (the default), all-NA arrays behave like empty arrays
   - With skipna=False, Kleene logic semantics are followed more closely

5. CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
   The behavior described in the bug report as "incorrect" is actually explicitly documented behavior. When skipna=True (the default), the methods are documented to treat all-NA arrays as empty arrays:
   - any() of all-NA returns False (like any() of empty array)
   - all() of all-NA returns True (like all() of empty array)

   This is NOT a violation of the implementation but rather the documented design choice when skipna=True.

6. KLEENE LOGIC VS SKIPNA SEMANTICS:
   The documentation makes it clear that full Kleene logic semantics are only applied when skipna=False. When skipna=True, NA values are skipped/ignored, which is a different semantic model that treats NA as "absent" rather than "unknown".
