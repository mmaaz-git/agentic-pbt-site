## Bug Triage Analysis

### Option 1: BUG (Most Likely)
**Why it's a BUG:**
- The function's docstring explicitly states "We require an exact match" between the replacement values and masked positions
- The purpose of the function, as stated in its name and documentation, is to prevent repetition
- The special case for `shape[-1] == 1` at line 93 allows repetition, directly contradicting the documented contract
- The function fails to enforce the exact match requirement for single-element arrays
- This is a clear violation of the function's stated purpose and contract

### Option 2: DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Less Likely)
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The implementation has an explicit special case for single-element arrays, suggesting it might be intentional
- Perhaps the documentation should say "We require an exact match, except for single-element arrays which are broadcast"
- However, this would be inconsistent with the function's name "putmask_WITHOUT_REPEAT"

### Option 3: INVALID (Unlikely)
**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The documentation is clear and unambiguous about requiring exact matches
- The test correctly expects a ValueError based on the documented behavior
- The bug report accurately describes the discrepancy between documentation and implementation

### Option 4: WONTFIX (Unlikely)
**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - single-element arrays are common in data processing
- The function is actively used within pandas internals (blocks.py)
- Silent repetition when the function promises no repetition could lead to data corruption
- The fix is simple and non-breaking for correct usage

### Option 5: FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Applicable)
**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The bug report isn't asking for new functionality
- It's pointing out that existing functionality doesn't match its documentation
- The function already claims to prevent repetition but fails to do so

### Conclusion
This is a **BUG**. The implementation contains a special case that violates the function's documented contract. The function promises to "require an exact match" and prevent repetition, but the `shape[-1] == 1` condition allows single-element arrays to be repeated. This is a clear implementation bug that should be fixed by removing the problematic special case.
