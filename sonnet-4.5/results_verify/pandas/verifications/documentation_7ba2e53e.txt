DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. Function Location and Accessibility:
   - combine_hash_arrays is located in pandas.core.util.hashing
   - It is NOT part of the public pandas API
   - It cannot be accessed via pandas.util or pandas.util.hashing
   - This is an internal function in the pandas.core namespace

2. Function Documentation:
   The function has minimal docstring:
   """
   Parameters
   ----------
   arrays : Iterator[np.ndarray]
   num_items : int

   Returns
   -------
   np.ndarray[uint64]

   Should be the same as CPython's tupleobject.c
   """

   Critical observations:
   - NO mention that arrays must have the same length
   - NO documentation of preconditions or constraints
   - NO warning about what happens with mismatched array lengths
   - The docstring only mentions it should behave like CPython's tuple hashing

3. Internal Usage Pattern:
   All internal uses in pandas ensure arrays have the same length:
   - When hashing Series with index: both have len(obj.index) elements
   - When hashing DataFrame columns: all columns have len(df.index) elements
   - When hashing MultiIndex levels: all levels have the same number of codes

4. Function Purpose:
   The function implements Python's tuple hashing algorithm to combine multiple hash arrays into a single hash array. The comment references CPython's tupleobject.c, indicating it should follow Python's tuple hashing behavior.

5. Documentation Gap:
   The documentation does NOT specify that all input arrays must have the same length. This is an undocumented precondition that the function relies on but never validates or mentions.

CONCLUSION: The documentation is insufficient and does not mention the same-length requirement, making this a valid documentation issue at minimum.
