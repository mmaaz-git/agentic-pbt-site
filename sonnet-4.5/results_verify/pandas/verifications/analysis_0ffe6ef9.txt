## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The validation clearly fails to catch an invalid input (step=0) that causes a crash during computation
2. The code crashes with an unhandled error after passing validation
3. Step=0 is semantically meaningless for a rolling window (would mean never advancing)
4. The code shows defensive programming with `(self.step or 1)` in some places, indicating developers knew step=0 was problematic
5. The fix is straightforward: change validation from `step < 0` to `step <= 0`
6. The bug prevents legitimate use of the API with a value that passes validation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The specific error message differs from what's reported (ZeroDivisionError vs ValueError)

**Verdict:** STRONG case for BUG

### Considering INVALID

**Arguments FOR:**
- The specific error reported ("slice step cannot be zero") doesn't match the actual error (ZeroDivisionError)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The core issue (step=0 passes validation but crashes) is correct
- The bug is reproducible and real
- The suggested fix would resolve the issue

**Verdict:** WEAK case for INVALID

### Considering WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR:**
- step=0 is an obscure edge case that likely won't occur in practice
- Users should know that step=0 doesn't make sense

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (one character change: < to <=)
- Validation exists specifically to catch invalid inputs
- The crash is unhandled and gives poor user experience

**Verdict:** WEAK case for WONTFIX

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state step must be > 0
- The documentation could be clearer about valid step values
- Users might not realize step=0 is invalid from current docs

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code itself has a bug in validation logic
- Even with better documentation, the code would still crash
- This is primarily a code issue, not a documentation issue

**Verdict:** MODERATE case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX (but code fix is still needed)

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as requesting better input validation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a bug in existing validation code
- The validation already exists but is incorrect
- Not asking for new functionality, just fixing broken validation

**Verdict:** WEAK case for FEATURE_REQUEST

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG**. The validation code explicitly checks for invalid step values but incorrectly allows step=0, which then causes an unhandled crash during computation. The validation should reject step=0 as it is both semantically invalid (a rolling window cannot have a step of 0) and practically problematic (causes crashes). The proposed fix is correct and minimal.
