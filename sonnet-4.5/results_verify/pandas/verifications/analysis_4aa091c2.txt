## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for each category:

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The error message has its arguments in the wrong order, producing semantically incorrect output
- The message says "Unable to locate 'source_file' referenced from 'include_file'" when it should say "Unable to locate 'include_file' referenced from 'source_file'"
- This is objectively wrong - the code is looking for the include file, not the source file
- The incorrect message confuses users debugging missing includes
- The fix is trivial and obvious: swap the arguments in the format string
- The bug affects user-facing error messages that are meant to help debug build issues

**Evidence supporting BUG classification:**
- Clear semantic incorrectness in the error message
- Reproducible with simple test cases
- Violates standard error message conventions
- The proposed fix is correct and straightforward

#### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The bug is in an error message, not in functional code
- It only appears when files cannot be found (error condition)
- Users can still figure out the meaning from context
- Low severity - doesn't break functionality

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Error messages are important for developer experience
- This is a user-facing message that appears during normal debugging
- The fix is trivial (swap two variables)
- Correct error messages are expected in professional software

#### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- No formal documentation specifies the exact error message format
- The code has been this way for potentially years without complaints

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The semantic incorrectness is objective and verifiable
- Standard conventions make the correct format obvious
- The bug report correctly identifies a real issue with swapped arguments

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- If somehow the documentation said this was the intended format

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- No documentation claims this backwards format is correct
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- The semantic meaning is clear from the code structure

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Improving error messages could be seen as an enhancement

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The current message is objectively wrong, not just suboptimal
- Bug fixes are not feature requests

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The error message has its arguments reversed, producing semantically incorrect output that confuses users. While it's a low-severity issue that only affects error messages, it's still objectively wrong and should be fixed. The fix is trivial and correct.
