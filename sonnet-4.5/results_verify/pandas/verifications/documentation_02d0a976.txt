## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation
The official documentation for `pandas.api.types.pandas_dtype()` states:

**Purpose**: Convert input into a pandas only dtype object or a numpy dtype object.

**Parameters**:
- `dtype`: object to be converted

**Returns**:
- np.dtype or a pandas dtype

**Raises**:
- TypeError if not a dtype

**Example**:
```python
>>> pd.api.types.pandas_dtype(int)
dtype('int64')
```

### Key Observations

1. **Vague Input Specification**: The documentation says "object to be converted" but doesn't specify what types of objects are acceptable. It doesn't explicitly state whether Series, arrays, or other pandas objects are supported.

2. **No Mention of Series Handling**: The documentation doesn't mention pandas Series as valid input, nor does it specify any special behavior for array-like objects.

3. **Source Code Reality**: Looking at the source code, the function DOES have special handling for `np.ndarray` (returns `dtype.dtype`), suggesting that array-like objects ARE intended to be supported.

4. **Implicit Behavior**: The fact that the function works with Series objects that have non-object dtypes suggests this is intended behavior, not accidental.

5. **Error Message Issue**: The documentation says it raises "TypeError if not a dtype" but doesn't clarify what constitutes "not a dtype". The current error message when passing a Series with object dtype is misleading.

### Documentation Gap
The documentation doesn't clearly specify:
- Whether pandas Series are valid input
- Whether the function should extract dtype from objects that have a `.dtype` attribute
- What the expected behavior is for array-like objects

Given that:
1. The function already handles `np.ndarray` specially
2. The function successfully handles Series with numeric dtypes
3. Series objects have a clear `.dtype` attribute

It appears the function SHOULD handle all Series uniformly, making this a legitimate bug rather than undefined behavior.
