Documentation Analysis
=====================

Documentation Review:

1. Official Documentation for density property:
   From the source code docstring (lines 698-707 in array.py):
   - States: "The percent of non-fill_value points, as decimal."
   - Provides example: SparseArray([0, 0, 1, 1, 1], fill_value=0) has density 0.6
   - NO mention of edge cases
   - NO mention of what happens with empty arrays
   - NO specification of expected behavior for zero-length arrays

2. API Documentation:
   - pandas.Series.sparse.density and pandas.DataFrame.sparse.density have similar descriptions
   - Described as "The percent of non-fill_value points, as decimal"
   - No edge case documentation found

3. Mathematical Interpretation:
   - The concept of "percent" or "density" for an empty collection is mathematically ambiguous
   - Common conventions in mathematics/statistics:
     * 0/0 is undefined (would justify raising an error)
     * Empty sets have 0% of any property (would justify returning 0.0)
     * Ratios with zero denominator are often represented as NaN (would justify returning NaN)

4. User Expectations:
   - The documentation says it returns "The percent... as decimal" without qualification
   - Users would reasonably expect a property access to not crash
   - Standard Python convention: properties should handle edge cases gracefully
   - Similar pandas operations (e.g., mean() on empty Series) return NaN, not crash

5. Documentation Gaps:
   - The documentation does not specify what should happen for empty arrays
   - No warning about potential ZeroDivisionError
   - No examples showing edge cases
   - The documentation is incomplete regarding this edge case

Conclusion: The documentation is insufficient and does not specify the expected behavior for empty arrays. However, the current behavior (crashing with ZeroDivisionError) violates reasonable expectations that property accessors should not crash on valid inputs.
