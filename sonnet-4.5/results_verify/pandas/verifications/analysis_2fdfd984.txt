## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function's type signature explicitly accepts `Sequence[Hashable]`, which includes strings, not just tuples
- The assertion causes a runtime crash rather than providing a helpful error message
- The comment "# for mypy" suggests the assertion was meant for static type checking, not runtime enforcement
- The function works inconsistently - accepts non-tuples when there are no duplicates but crashes when duplicates exist
- The docstring provides no warning about tuple requirements
- This is a clear violation of the function's contract as defined by its type signature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function appears to be internal (not in public API documentation)
- In normal pandas usage via parsers, `is_potential_multiindex=True` only occurs when names are already tuples

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is internal and not part of the public API
- The normal code path (via parsers) ensures tuples are passed when `is_potential_multiindex=True`
- The assertion might be considered a valid precondition check

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The type signature explicitly allows non-tuples
- Even internal functions should honor their type signatures
- An assertion with "# for mypy" comment shouldn't cause runtime crashes
- The function partially works with non-tuples (when no duplicates)

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an edge case that wouldn't occur in normal pandas usage
- The function is internal and not meant to be called directly
- The crash only happens with a specific combination (non-tuples + duplicates + is_potential_multiindex=True)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is straightforward (proper error handling)
- The current behavior is confusing and inconsistent
- Even internal functions should fail gracefully

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The type signature could be updated to reflect the tuple requirement
- The docstring could document the tuple requirement for `is_potential_multiindex=True`
- This would align documentation with implementation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The current type signature is technically correct for the general case
- The implementation is what's wrong, not the documentation
- Changing the type signature would be a breaking change

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Supporting non-tuples with `is_potential_multiindex=True` could be seen as a new feature
- The current implementation doesn't handle this case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The type signature already promises this functionality
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function partially works with non-tuples already

### Decision Rationale:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has a type signature that promises to accept any `Sequence[Hashable]`, but crashes with an `AssertionError` when given valid input according to that signature. The assertion's comment "# for mypy" strongly suggests it was meant for static type checking only, not runtime enforcement.

Key factors:
1. **Contract violation**: The function doesn't honor its type signature
2. **Poor error handling**: Uses assertion instead of proper error with helpful message
3. **Inconsistent behavior**: Works with non-tuples when no duplicates, fails with duplicates
4. **Misleading implementation**: Comment suggests static checking, but causes runtime crash

Even though this is an internal function and the error might not occur in normal pandas usage through the documented API, it's still a bug that should be fixed. The function should either:
- Handle non-tuples gracefully when `is_potential_multiindex=True`, or
- Raise a proper TypeError with a clear message instead of an assertion error
