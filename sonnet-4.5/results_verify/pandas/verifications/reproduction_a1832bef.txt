REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT: pandas.compat.is_platform_power Docstring Mismatch

1. RUNNING THE REPRODUCTION CODE:

I ran the provided reproduction code and confirmed the bug exists:

Output:
```
Docstring says:

Checking if the running platform use Power architecture.

Returns
-------
bool
    True if the running platform uses ARM architecture.


Implementation checks:
True

The docstring incorrectly states "ARM architecture" instead of "Power architecture"
```

2. EXAMINING THE SOURCE CODE:

I inspected the actual source code at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/compat/__init__.py

Lines 118-127 contain the is_platform_power() function:
```python
def is_platform_power() -> bool:
    """
    Checking if the running platform use Power architecture.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the running platform uses ARM architecture.
    """
    return platform.machine() in ("ppc64", "ppc64le")
```

Lines 104-115 contain the is_platform_arm() function:
```python
def is_platform_arm() -> bool:
    """
    Checking if the running platform use ARM architecture.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the running platform uses ARM architecture.
    """
    return platform.machine() in ("arm64", "aarch64") or platform.machine().startswith("armv")
```

3. THE BUG IS CONFIRMED:

The docstring for is_platform_power() incorrectly states in the Returns section:
"True if the running platform uses ARM architecture."

But the function implementation clearly checks for Power architecture:
- It returns True when platform.machine() is "ppc64" or "ppc64le"
- These are Power architecture identifiers, not ARM

The main description line "Checking if the running platform use Power architecture" is correct.
Only the Returns section has the wrong architecture name.

4. ROOT CAUSE:

This is clearly a copy-paste error. The is_platform_arm() function immediately precedes
is_platform_power() in the source file and has identical docstring wording. When
is_platform_power() was added, the docstring was copied but the Returns section wasn't
updated to change "ARM" to "Power".

5. IMPACT:

This is a documentation bug that could confuse users reading the docstring, making them
think the function checks for ARM when it actually checks for Power architecture.
