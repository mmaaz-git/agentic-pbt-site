## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `length_of_indexer` function has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Returns: int
- No additional parameter documentation or behavior specification

### Key Findings

1. **Internal Function**: This is an internal pandas utility function in `pandas.core.indexers.utils`, not part of the public API. The pandas.core module is explicitly marked as PRIVATE.

2. **Python Slicing Behavior**: According to Python's official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html):
   - Negative indices are relative to the end of the sequence: len(s) + i is substituted
   - Python slices ALWAYS return valid subsequences
   - Slicing an empty list with any indices returns an empty list (length 0)
   - Python never returns negative-length sequences

3. **Expected Behavior**: Given the docstring states "Return the expected length of target[indexer]", the function should return what len(target[indexer]) would return in Python, which:
   - Is always >= 0 (lengths cannot be negative)
   - For empty targets, is always 0 regardless of the slice indices

4. **No Special Case Documentation**: The function documentation does not specify any special behavior for:
   - Empty targets
   - Negative indices
   - Edge cases where negative indices go beyond sequence bounds

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly states the function should return "the expected length of target[indexer]". Since Python's behavior is well-defined (slices always return non-negative lengths), and the function claims to return what would be the expected length of applying an indexer to a target, returning negative values violates both:
1. The contract stated in the docstring
2. Python's fundamental behavior that lengths are non-negative integers
