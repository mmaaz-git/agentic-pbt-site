## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is an internal/private function (prefixed with underscore) and not part of the public API. Private functions might have different behavioral expectations than public ones, and users shouldn't be directly calling internal functions. The documentation might be intended more as a guide for internal developers rather than a strict contract. Additionally, returning -1 for empty strings could be considered a valid sentinel value to indicate "no column."

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function has explicit documentation stating it should raise a ValueError for invalid column names, and an empty string is clearly not a valid Excel column name. The bug report demonstrates actual incorrect behavior that contradicts the documented behavior. The function is used internally by other pandas functions, and the incorrect behavior propagates to those functions.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal function that users shouldn't be calling directly. The impact might be minimal since most users would use the public API functions which might handle empty strings before calling this function. The current behavior of returning -1 might be relied upon by other internal code, and changing it could break backward compatibility. The issue only occurs with clearly invalid input that shouldn't be passed to the function in normal usage.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug can cause real issues when it propagates through other functions like `_range2cols`, potentially causing silent failures or unexpected behavior with negative indexing. The fix is simple and aligns the code with its documentation. Even internal functions should behave as documented to maintain code quality and prevent future bugs.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior of returning -1 for empty strings might be intentional, serving as a sentinel value. The documentation could be updated to specify that empty strings return -1 rather than raising an error. This would be less disruptive than changing the code behavior, especially for an internal function that might have unknown dependencies.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation clearly states the function should raise ValueError for invalid input, and this aligns with standard Python practices and Excel column name conventions. Returning -1 for invalid input is poor design as -1 is a valid Python list index (accessing the last element). The documented behavior is more logical and safer than the current implementation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding validation for empty strings could be seen as a new feature - enhanced input validation. The current function works for all valid inputs, and adding error handling for invalid inputs could be considered an enhancement rather than a bug fix. This could be framed as "please add validation for empty string inputs."

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The documentation already promises this behavior - it's not a new feature but rather fixing the implementation to match the existing specification. The function documentation explicitly states it raises ValueError for invalid input, so this is about fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function's behavior directly contradicts its documentation - it should raise ValueError for invalid column names but returns -1 for empty strings instead. An empty string is unambiguously not a valid Excel column name. The incorrect behavior propagates to other functions and can cause silent failures or unexpected results. The bug is clearly reproducible and the fix is straightforward.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function is internal/private (underscore prefix) and not part of the public API, so strict adherence to documentation might not be required. The behavior might be intentional for backward compatibility reasons. Users shouldn't be calling this function directly anyway. The impact might be minimal in practice since public API functions might validate input before calling this.

## Overall Consideration

After analyzing all aspects, this appears to be a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** issue rather than a BUG. Here's why:

First, the function is clearly internal/private as indicated by the underscore prefix. Private functions in Python are not part of the public API contract, and their behavior can be more flexible than what strict documentation might suggest. The fact that no public pandas documentation exists for this function reinforces that users should not be calling it directly.

Second, while the documentation states the function should raise ValueError for invalid input, the current behavior of returning -1 for empty strings appears to be used by other internal functions like `_range2cols`. Changing this behavior could potentially break existing internal code that relies on this sentinel value. The examples in `_range2cols` show that empty strings in ranges like `':B'` produce `[-1, 0, 1]`, suggesting the -1 return value might be intentional for handling edge cases in range specifications.

Third, the proper fix would be to update the documentation to accurately reflect the current behavior: "Returns -1 for empty or whitespace-only strings, raises ValueError for strings containing invalid characters." This maintains backward compatibility while making the behavior explicit. If the behavior truly needs to change, it should be done carefully with consideration for all internal uses, which is beyond the scope of a simple bug fix.
