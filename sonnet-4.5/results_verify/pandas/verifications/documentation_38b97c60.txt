## Documentation Analysis for FixedWindowIndexer

### Official Documentation Review

I reviewed the available pandas documentation for window indexers:

1. **BaseIndexer.get_window_bounds Documentation**:
   - States it "Computes the bounds of a window"
   - Returns "A tuple of ndarray[int64]s, indicating the boundaries of each window"
   - No explicit statement about the invariant that start <= end

2. **Window Operations Documentation**:
   - Describes that get_window_bounds returns "a tuple of two arrays, the first being the starting indices of the windows and second being the ending indices of the windows"
   - Explains the `closed` parameter options:
     - 'right': close right endpoint
     - 'left': close left endpoint
     - 'both': close both endpoints
     - 'neither': open endpoints
   - No specific documentation about window_size=0 edge cases

3. **Implementation Comments**:
   - The source code docstring states the method returns window boundaries but doesn't explicitly document the start <= end invariant
   - Example implementations in the base class documentation show straightforward cases where start < end

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say

The documentation does not explicitly state:
1. That start must always be <= end (though this is a reasonable expectation for window bounds)
2. How window_size=0 should be handled
3. Whether invalid window bounds (start > end) are acceptable in any scenario
4. The interaction between window_size=0 and the closed parameter

### Implicit Expectations

While not explicitly documented, the concept of window bounds strongly implies:
1. Windows represent contiguous ranges of data
2. A window from position start to end should include elements [start, end) following Python's slicing convention
3. For this to be meaningful, start must be <= end (an empty window would have start == end)

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation lacks:
1. Explicit invariant specifications for the returned bounds
2. Edge case handling for window_size=0
3. Clarification on whether the centering logic should apply when window_size=0 (the current code treats window_size=0 as if center=True)
