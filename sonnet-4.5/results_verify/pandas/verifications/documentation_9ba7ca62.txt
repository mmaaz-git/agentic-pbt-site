DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function Status:
hash_tuples is an INTERNAL function in pandas.core.util.hashing, not part of the public API exposed through pd.util.

Documentation Found:
1. The function has a docstring that states:
   "Hash an MultiIndex / listlike-of-tuples efficiently."
   - Parameters: vals (MultiIndex or listlike-of-tuples), encoding, hash_key
   - Returns: ndarray[np.uint64] of hashed values

2. The docstring does NOT specify behavior for empty inputs
3. The docstring does NOT state that empty inputs should raise an error
4. The docstring does NOT state that empty inputs should be handled gracefully

Related Public API Functions:
1. pandas.util.hash_pandas_object - Can hash Index/Series/DataFrame objects
   - Documentation does not specify empty input behavior

2. pandas.util.hash_array - Hashes 1d arrays
   - Documentation does not explicitly specify empty input behavior
   - In practice, it handles empty arrays gracefully

Key Observations:
1. Since hash_tuples is INTERNAL (not in public API), users should not be directly calling it
2. The function is used internally by hash_pandas_object for MultiIndex objects
3. The documentation does not establish a contract for empty input handling
4. There is no specification that requires consistency across all hashing functions
5. MultiIndex.from_tuples() documentation likely specifies it cannot handle empty input without knowing the number of levels

Implications:
- Without public API documentation specifying expected behavior for empty inputs, this is technically unspecified behavior
- The internal nature of the function suggests it may have different requirements than public functions
- The error comes from a well-documented limitation of MultiIndex.from_tuples() which requires level information
