REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

The bug report is accurate and has been successfully reproduced.

## Hypothesis Test
The provided Hypothesis test correctly identifies the bug. When run, it finds multiple failing examples:
- Input: ')' - raises re.PatternError: unbalanced parenthesis at position 0
- Input: '?' - raises re.PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0

## Manual Test Cases
All four manual test cases confirm the bug:
1. '[' - raises PatternError: unterminated character set at position 0
2. '?' - raises PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
3. '*' - raises PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0
4. '(unclosed' - raises PatternError: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0

## Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: is_re_compilable() should return False for invalid regex patterns
- **Actual**: is_re_compilable() raises re.PatternError for invalid regex patterns

## Current Implementation
The function currently only catches TypeError exceptions (lines 189-190 in inference.py), which handles non-string inputs like integers, None, lists, etc. However, it does not catch re.error (or re.PatternError), which is raised when a string is a syntactically invalid regex pattern.

## Proposed Fix Verification
The proposed fix (catching both TypeError and re.error) was tested and works correctly:
- Invalid regex patterns return False (as expected)
- Valid regex patterns return True (unchanged)
- Non-string types return False (unchanged)

The bug is real and the proposed fix is correct.
