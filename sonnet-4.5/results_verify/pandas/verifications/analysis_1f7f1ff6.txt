# Bug Report Analysis

## Evaluation for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The documentation explicitly promises that deregister() will "set the state of the registry back to the state before pandas registered its own units"
2. This promise is demonstrably violated - after register/deregister cycles, datetime.datetime remains in the registry when it wasn't there originally
3. The function fails to be idempotent as expected - multiple cycles produce different results
4. The bug report correctly identifies the root cause (_mpl_units cache accumulation)
5. The issue affects real-world usage where libraries may call register/deregister multiple times
6. The proposed fix is reasonable and addresses the root cause

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None significant. This is clearly broken behavior that violates documented promises.

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The documented behavior is clear and the implementation fails to meet it.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation explicitly promises restoration behavior
- The test clearly shows the promise is violated
- This is not a case of undefined or ambiguous behavior

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that calling register/deregister multiple times is an edge case
- Most users likely only call these functions once per session

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't say "only call once" - it promises restoration
- Libraries that use pandas may legitimately need to register/deregister multiple times
- The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental violation of the function's contract

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could change documentation to say "may not work correctly with multiple calls"
- Could document that it's not a true inverse operation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The current behavior is clearly wrong, not just poorly documented
- Changing documentation to match broken behavior would be accepting a bug
- The implementation should match the documentation, not vice versa

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that true idempotent behavior is a "new feature"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation already promises this behavior
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality
- The function is supposed to restore state - that's its core purpose

## Detailed Analysis

The bug report is well-structured and provides:
1. Clear reproduction steps
2. Property-based tests demonstrating the issue
3. Root cause analysis with specific line numbers
4. A proposed fix

The core issue is that `deregister_matplotlib_converters()` explicitly promises in its documentation to restore the matplotlib registry to its pre-registration state, but fails to do so after multiple register/deregister cycles. This is not undefined behavior or an edge case - it's a direct violation of the documented contract.

The bug occurs because the `_mpl_units` cache persists across function calls and accumulates state incorrectly. On the second register() call, it caches matplotlib's own converters (which were restored by the first deregister()), then on the second deregister(), it restores them again even though they weren't present initially.

## Conclusion

This is a valid BUG. The function fails to perform its documented purpose of restoring the registry to its original state. The behavior violates the explicit promise in the documentation, affects real-world usage patterns, and has a clear fix that addresses the root cause without breaking other functionality.
