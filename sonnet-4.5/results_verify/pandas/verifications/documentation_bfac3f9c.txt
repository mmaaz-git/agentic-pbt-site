## Documentation Analysis

### Pandas Documentation for ExcelWriter.close()

1. **Official pandas documentation**:
   - The close() method is described as a "synonym for save, to make it more file-like"
   - The documentation recommends using ExcelWriter as a context manager, but also states that if not used as a context manager, "call close() to save and close any opened file handles"
   - NO explicit documentation about idempotency
   - NO warning that close() cannot be called multiple times
   - NO specification of what happens if close() is called on an already-closed writer

2. **The "file-like" claim**:
   - The docstring explicitly states the method exists "to make it more file-like"
   - This creates an expectation that it should behave like Python's file objects

### Python's File-Like Object Standards

According to Python's official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.close):
- The close() method for file-like objects is EXPLICITLY documented as idempotent
- Quote: "As a convenience, it is allowed to call this method more than once; only the first call, however, will have an effect."
- This is a fundamental part of Python's I/O base class contract

### Testing Confirms Standard Behavior
- Python's built-in file objects (created with open()) DO allow multiple close() calls without error
- This is the standard, expected behavior for file-like objects in Python

### Documentation Gap
The pandas documentation:
1. Claims the method makes ExcelWriter "more file-like"
2. Does NOT document that it violates the standard file-like close() behavior
3. Does NOT warn users that calling close() twice will raise an error
4. Does NOT specify any requirements about tracking whether close() has been called

### Conclusion
The documentation strongly implies that ExcelWriter.close() should behave like a standard file's close() method (idempotent), but the actual implementation violates this expectation. There is no documentation warning users about this non-standard behavior.
