REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. BUG CONFIRMATION: The bug is real and reproducible
   - When using pd.read_json() with a value below int64_min (-9223372036854775809), it raises ValueError: "Value is too small"
   - When using pd.read_json() with a value above int64_max (9223372036854775808), it successfully converts to uint64

2. TEST RESULTS:
   a) Value below int64_min (-2^63 - 1 = -9223372036854775809):
      - Result: ValueError: Value is too small
      - The function crashes with an exception

   b) Value above int64_max (2^63 = 9223372036854775808):
      - Result: Successfully reads the JSON
      - Converts the value to uint64 dtype
      - No error is raised

3. ASYMMETRIC BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED:
   The bug report is accurate about the asymmetric behavior:
   - Overflow above int64_max → silently converted to uint64 (SUCCESS)
   - Underflow below int64_min → raises ValueError (FAILURE)

4. VALID JSON:
   Both test values are valid JSON integers as confirmed by Python's json.dumps():
   - json.dumps([{"key": -9223372036854775809}]) works fine
   - json.dumps([{"key": 9223372036854775808}]) works fine

   The standard json module has no problem serializing these values, indicating they are valid JSON.

5. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   The Hypothesis test passed 100 examples without finding this specific edge case naturally, but when tested directly with the failing input, it confirms the crash.

CONCLUSION: The bug is reproducible exactly as described in the report. pandas.read_json() does indeed handle integer overflow asymmetrically, accepting values above int64_max but rejecting values below int64_min.
