REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer.

TEST RESULTS:
-------------
1. Hypothesis Test: CONFIRMED BUG
   - The property-based test fails on range(1, 0, 1)
   - Expected length: 0
   - Actual returned: -1
   - The test correctly identifies that length_of_indexer violates the fundamental invariant that
     length_of_indexer(indexer) should equal len(indexer)

2. Direct Reproduction: CONFIRMED BUG
   - range(1, 0, 1): Expected 0, Got -1 ✗
   - range(5, 3, 1): Expected 0, Got -2 ✗
   - range(0, 5, 2): Expected 3, Got 2 ✗

   The bug affects:
   a) Empty ranges where start > stop (returns negative values instead of 0)
   b) Non-empty ranges with step > 1 (incorrect calculation)

3. Root Cause Analysis:
   The implementation at lines 325-326 of pandas/core/indexers/utils.py:
   ```python
   elif isinstance(indexer, range):
       return (indexer.stop - indexer.start) // indexer.step
   ```

   This formula is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't handle empty ranges (returns negative when start > stop)
   - It doesn't correctly calculate length for non-unit steps
   - It doesn't match Python's actual range length calculation

4. Python's Correct Behavior:
   Python's built-in range ALWAYS returns non-negative length:
   - range(1, 0, 1) correctly returns length 0
   - range(0, 5, 2) correctly returns length 3
   - Uses formula: max(0, (stop - start + step - 1) // step) for positive step

CONCLUSION: The bug is real and affects core functionality. The function returns incorrect
lengths for range objects, violating the basic contract that it should return the same
value as len(indexer).
