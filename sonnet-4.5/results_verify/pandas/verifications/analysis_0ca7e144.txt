## Triage Analysis for Bug Report

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Arguments For:**
1. The functions explicitly document they return `nd.array` in their docstrings
2. The actual behavior (returning integer `0`) violates this documented contract
3. This is a type inconsistency that could cause downstream failures
4. The fix is straightforward and reasonable (return empty numpy array)
5. The behavior is not edge-case or obscure - empty lists are common inputs
6. This affects public API functions that could be used by external code

**Arguments Against:**
- These are auxiliary/internal functions (though still part of public API)
- Empty list concatenation might be considered an edge case

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- None identified. The documentation is clear about return type.

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is reproducible and violates documented behavior
- The documentation explicitly states return type as `nd.array`

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue empty list concatenation is rare
- Functions are auxiliary/internal helpers

**Arguments Against:**
- Not an obscure edge case - empty lists are common
- Type inconsistency is a serious issue for typed code
- The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality
- This affects type safety and predictability

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- None identified. This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality.

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation already promises numpy array return type
- This is a bug fix, not a new feature

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue documentation should mention empty list behavior

**Arguments Against:**
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Documentation correctly states return type should be `nd.array`
- Changing docs to say "returns int for empty lists" would be worse API design

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The functions have explicit documentation stating they return `nd.array`, but they return an integer `0` for empty list inputs. This violates the documented contract and can cause type errors in downstream code. The issue is not obscure, the fix is straightforward, and maintaining consistent return types is important for API reliability.
