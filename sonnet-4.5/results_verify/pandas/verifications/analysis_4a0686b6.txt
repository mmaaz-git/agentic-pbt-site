## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
- The current behavior creates empty chunks which waste computational resources
- Empty chunks serve no practical purpose and may confuse downstream consumers
- The fix is simple and improves efficiency
- While not explicitly documented, it's reasonable to expect chunks to contain data
- The behavior violates the principle of least surprise

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly forbid empty chunks
- The protocol specification is vague about this edge case

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state that chunks must be non-empty
- The protocol doesn't define behavior when n_chunks > num_rows
- The current implementation technically fulfills the contract of returning n_chunks chunks

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Creating empty chunks is wasteful and serves no purpose
- Most developers would reasonably expect chunks to contain data
- The bug report correctly identifies a logic flaw in the implementation

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an edge case (requesting more chunks than rows)
- The pandas documentation already warns of "severe implementation issues" with the interchange protocol
- Pandas recommends using Arrow C Data Interface instead
- The issue is marked as "Low" severity

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (changing one line)
- The issue could cause unexpected behavior in production code
- It's not an obscure edge case - it's a simple logic error

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- The protocol doesn't specify this behavior, so handling it better could be seen as an enhancement
- Adding validation for n_chunks could be considered a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The current implementation has a clear logic error

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The protocol documentation could be clearer about empty chunks
- The specification could define expected behavior when n_chunks > num_rows

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The issue is primarily with the implementation, not the documentation
- Even without explicit documentation, creating empty chunks is inefficient

## Conclusion
This appears to be a valid BUG. While the documentation doesn't explicitly forbid empty chunks, the current implementation has a clear logic error that causes wasteful behavior. The fix is simple and improves the code's efficiency and correctness. The creation of empty chunks serves no purpose and violates reasonable expectations about how chunking should work.
