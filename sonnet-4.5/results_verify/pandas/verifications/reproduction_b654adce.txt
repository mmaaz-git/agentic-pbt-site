## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in the pandas.io.sas.sas7bdat.SAS7BDATReader.__init__ method.

### Verification Steps Performed:

1. Located the file at: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/sas/sas7bdat.py

2. Read lines 204-208 from the file and confirmed:
   - Line 205: `self._current_row_in_file_index = 0`
   - Line 206: `self._current_row_on_page_index = 0`
   - Line 207: `self._current_row_in_file_index = 0` (DUPLICATE)

3. The duplicate assignment is exactly as described in the bug report - the same variable `_current_row_in_file_index` is initialized to 0 on both lines 205 and 207.

4. Additional investigation revealed:
   - `_current_row_in_chunk_index` is used later in the code (lines 685 and 721)
   - `_current_row_in_chunk_index` is NOT initialized in `__init__`, only set to 0 on line 685 when needed
   - This supports the hypothesis that line 207 might have been intended to initialize `_current_row_in_chunk_index`

### Effect of the Bug:

The bug has no functional impact on the code's behavior because:
- The second assignment (line 207) simply overwrites the first (line 205) with the same value (0)
- No code executes between these two lines that would depend on the value

However, this represents:
1. **Code redundancy**: Unnecessary duplicate line that serves no purpose
2. **Maintenance issue**: Could lead to confusion or errors if one line is modified without the other
3. **Possible intent error**: May have been meant to initialize a different variable

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
