DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. OFFICIAL PANDAS DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------------
The pandas documentation for AbstractMethodError shows:

Signature: `pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError(class_instance, methodtype='method')`

Purpose: "Raise this error instead of NotImplementedError for abstract methods"

Parameters:
- class_instance: The class or instance where the abstract method is not implemented
- methodtype: str, default "method" - Must be one of {"method", "classmethod", "staticmethod", "property"}

2. DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES
----------------------
The docstring in the source code (lines 277-291) provides examples:

```python
>>> class Foo:
...     @classmethod
...     def classmethod(cls):
...         raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(cls, methodtype="classmethod")
...     def method(self):
...         raise pd.errors.AbstractMethodError(self)
```

Key observation: The example shows passing `cls` (a class) for classmethods and `self` (an instance) for regular methods.

3. DOCUMENTATION IMPLICATIONS
-----------------------------
a) Parameter naming: The parameter is called "class_instance" which is ambiguous - it could mean either a class OR an instance.

b) Documentation doesn't explicitly state: The documentation does NOT explicitly state that when methodtype="classmethod", the class_instance parameter MUST be a class object rather than an instance.

c) The example implies but doesn't mandate: While the example shows the correct usage (cls for classmethod), it's presented as an example, not as a requirement.

4. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION DOESN'T SAY
--------------------------------------
The documentation does NOT:
- Explicitly state that class_instance must be a class when methodtype="classmethod"
- Document what happens if you pass an instance when methodtype="classmethod"
- Provide any warnings about this restriction
- Include validation requirements in the parameter description

5. REASONABLE USER EXPECTATIONS
--------------------------------
Based on the documentation:
- A user could reasonably expect that if the __init__ accepts an instance for methodtype="classmethod", then all methods of the error object should handle it correctly
- The parameter name "class_instance" suggests it can be either a class OR an instance
- There's no explicit contract that forbids passing an instance when methodtype="classmethod"

6. CONCLUSION
-------------
The documentation is incomplete. It doesn't clearly specify the requirement that class_instance must be a class (not an instance) when methodtype="classmethod". The example shows correct usage but doesn't explain that it's the ONLY valid usage. This lack of clarity in the documentation contributes to the bug being a valid issue rather than user error.
