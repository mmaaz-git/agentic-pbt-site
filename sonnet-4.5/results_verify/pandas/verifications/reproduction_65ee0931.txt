## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug in pandas.io.json._normalize.convert_to_line_delimits. The function has an operator precedence error that causes it to incorrectly process non-list JSON strings.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test from the bug report runs and fails as expected:
- Input: '{"0": 0}' (a JSON object)
- Output: '"0": 0\n' (corrupted - missing curly braces)
- Expected: '{"0": 0}' (should be unchanged)

The test confirms that JSON objects are being corrupted by having their first and last characters stripped.

### Manual Test Results
The manual test case also confirms the bug:
- Input: '{"key": "value"}' (a JSON object)
- Output: '"key": "value"\n' (corrupted - missing curly braces)
- Expected: '{"key": "value"}' (should be unchanged)

### Function Behavior Analysis
I tested the function with different JSON types:

1. **JSON Lists (intended use case)**: Works correctly
   - Input: '[{"a": 1}, {"b": 2}]'
   - Output: '{"a": 1}\n {"b": 2}\n'
   - This is the correct line-delimited JSON output

2. **JSON Objects (bug case)**: Incorrectly processed
   - Input: '{"key": "value"}'
   - Output: '"key": "value"\n' (corrupted)

3. **Malformed JSON**: Handled differently by current vs fixed logic
   - Input: '{"a": 1]' (starts with { but ends with ])
   - Current logic returns it unchanged (accidentally correct)
   - Fixed logic would also return it unchanged (intentionally correct)

### Root Cause Analysis
The bug is in line 38 of _normalize.py:
```python
if not s[0] == "[" and s[-1] == "]":
    return s
```

Due to operator precedence, this evaluates as:
```python
if (not (s[0] == "[")) and (s[-1] == "]"):
```

This condition is TRUE only when:
- The string does NOT start with "[" AND
- The string DOES end with "]"

For JSON objects like '{"key": "value"}':
- not (s[0] == "[") = not (False) = True (starts with "{", not "[")
- s[-1] == "]" = False (ends with "}", not "]")
- True and False = False
- So it does NOT return early, and incorrectly processes the JSON object

The intended logic should be "if NOT a JSON list" which requires:
```python
if not (s[0] == "[" and s[-1] == "]"):
```

### Impact
This bug corrupts any valid JSON that is not a list (objects, strings, numbers, etc.) by:
1. Stripping the first and last characters
2. Passing it through convert_json_to_lines which adds newlines

This makes the function unusable for its documented purpose of converting JSON to line-delimited JSON when the input might contain non-list JSON.
