## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report claims that astype violates its documented contract by returning a numpy.ndarray instead of SparseArray. However, there was a deliberate change in pandas 1.5 (PR #45339) to make astype respect non-sparse dtypes and return dense arrays when given numpy dtypes. The current behavior (returning ndarray for numpy dtypes) might be the intended new behavior after this deprecation cycle, meaning the documentation is outdated rather than the code being wrong.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The docstring explicitly and unequivocally states "The output will always be a SparseArray" with no qualifications or exceptions. This is a clear promise in the current documentation that is being violated. The code comment referencing GH#34457 doesn't change what the documentation promises to users.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered a minor issue since there's a clear workaround - users can wrap their dtype in SparseDtype() to get the sparse behavior. Additionally, the current behavior (converting to dense for numpy dtypes) might be more intuitive and what most users actually want when they pass a numpy dtype.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it's a fundamental contract violation where the method returns a completely different type than documented. This could break existing code that depends on the documented behavior. The distinction between SparseArray and ndarray is significant for memory usage and performance.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The implementation appears to be deliberate (with the GH#34457 comment) and was changed intentionally in pandas 1.5. The behavior makes sense - when users specify a numpy dtype, they get a numpy array back. The documentation simply hasn't been updated to reflect this intentional change. The docstring should be updated to say "The output will be a SparseArray when a SparseDtype is provided, otherwise a numpy array is returned."

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is very explicit and leaves no room for interpretation. If this was an intentional change, the documentation should have been updated as part of that change. The examples in the docstring all show SparseDtype being used, suggesting that might have always been the intended usage pattern.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that having astype always return SparseArray (as documented) would be a new feature to add, since the current implementation deliberately returns dense arrays for numpy dtypes. Users might be requesting the behavior described in the documentation as a new capability.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality - it's pointing out that the existing functionality doesn't match its documentation. The documented behavior already exists (it works with SparseDtype), so this is about consistency, not new features.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The docstring makes an absolute promise: "The output will always be a SparseArray." This is violated when numpy dtypes are used. The Returns section explicitly states "SparseArray" with no conditionals. This is a clear contract violation where the implementation doesn't match the documented behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The behavior appears intentional based on PR #45339 which deliberately changed astype to respect non-sparse dtypes. The GH#34457 comment in the code suggests this was a considered decision. This might be a case where the documentation wasn't updated after an intentional behavior change.

## Overall consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** issue rather than a bug. The key evidence is:

First, there was an intentional change in pandas 1.5 (PR #45339) titled "DEPR: SparseArray.astype(dtype) respect non-sparse dtype" that deliberately modified the behavior to return dense arrays when non-sparse dtypes are provided. This was done to address the inconsistency where arr.astype(target_dtype).dtype != target_dtype. The change was made to ensure that when users specify a numpy dtype, they get back an array with exactly that dtype, not a SparseDtype wrapping it.

Second, the current implementation with the GH#34457 comment shows this is deliberate behavior, not an oversight or bug. The code explicitly checks if the dtype is not SparseDtype and converts to a dense array in that case. This aligns with the goal of PR #45339 to make dtype conversions more predictable and consistent across pandas.

Third, while the docstring states "The output will always be a SparseArray," this documentation appears to be outdated and wasn't updated when the behavior was intentionally changed. The examples in the docstring all use SparseDtype, which still works correctly and returns SparseArray. The documentation should be updated to reflect that SparseArray is only returned when using SparseDtype, while numpy dtypes return numpy arrays to maintain dtype consistency.
