## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function behaves exactly as its docstring describes - it shifts Saturday and Sunday to Monday, which is exactly what it says it does. The docstring never claims it will find the "next Monday" from any arbitrary date. It specifically talks about holidays falling on weekends. The function is working correctly according to its documented behavior for weekend dates, and the docstring's silence on weekday behavior could be interpreted as "no change for weekdays." The function is part of a holiday observance system where this behavior is standard and expected.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function name "next_monday" is genuinely misleading and violates naming conventions. A function named "next_monday" in any programming context would be expected to find the next Monday from a given date. The docstring is incomplete as it doesn't specify what happens for weekdays, leaving users to guess. Other similar functions in the same module have clearer names like "weekend_to_monday" that accurately describe their behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a minor naming issue in an internal holiday observance function that has likely been in use for years. The actual behavior is correct for its intended use case (holiday observance rules). Changing either the name or behavior would break backward compatibility for minimal benefit. The function works perfectly fine for its intended purpose within the holiday system, and users who need actual "next Monday" functionality can easily implement it themselves or use other date manipulation methods.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The misleading name causes genuine confusion and violates the principle of least surprise. This isn't just a trivial issue - it's a fundamental mismatch between the function name and its behavior. The pandas library is widely used, and having misleadingly named functions damages its reputation for clarity and usability. The issue is significant enough to warrant either fixing the documentation or deprecating the function in favor of a better-named alternative.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function works correctly for its intended purpose (holiday observance), but the documentation is incomplete. The docstring doesn't mention what happens for weekdays, which is a significant omission. Adding complete documentation explaining that weekdays are returned unchanged would resolve the confusion. The function name, while not ideal, could be justified in documentation as being specific to holiday observance contexts where "next Monday" means "observe on Monday if weekend."

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply updating documentation doesn't fix the fundamental problem that the function name is misleading. No amount of documentation can make "next_monday(Thursday) returns Thursday" intuitive. The issue goes beyond documentation - it's a design problem where the function name doesn't match its behavior. Users will continue to be confused even with better documentation because they'll make assumptions based on the function name before reading docs.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for functionality that matches what the function name suggests - finding the next Monday from any date. This is new functionality that doesn't currently exist in this function. The request to either rename the function or change its behavior to match the name could be considered a feature request for improved API design. Adding a new function that actually finds the next Monday would be a valuable feature addition.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but pointing out that the existing function has a misleading name. The function already exists and works - the issue is that its name doesn't match its behavior. This is a bug in API design, not a request for new features. The user isn't asking for new capabilities but for the existing function to be less confusing.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function name "next_monday" creates a clear contract that the function will return the next Monday, which it violates for weekdays. This is a bug in API design where the function name is objectively wrong. Good API design requires function names to accurately describe their behavior, and this function fails that test. The fact that similar functions like "weekend_to_monday" exist with accurate names shows this isn't a naming convention issue but a mistake.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function behaves exactly as coded and documented (for the parts that are documented). It correctly implements the holiday observance rule it was designed for. The behavior isn't wrong - it's the expected behavior for holiday observance where weekdays aren't shifted. This is working code that serves its intended purpose in the holiday system. The name, while not ideal, doesn't prevent the function from working correctly in its context.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at all the considerations, this bug report presents a genuine issue with the function's naming that violates basic API design principles. The function is named "next_monday" but doesn't return the next Monday for most inputs (Monday through Friday). This is objectively misleading and causes confusion, as demonstrated by the bug report.

However, the function itself works correctly for its intended purpose within the holiday observance system. It implements a standard business rule where holidays falling on weekends are observed on Monday, while holidays on weekdays are observed on the actual day. This is not a bug in functionality but rather a poorly chosen function name that doesn't reflect the actual behavior.

The most appropriate categorization is DOCUMENTATION_FIX. While the function name is indeed misleading, changing it would break backward compatibility, and the function works correctly for its intended use case. The documentation should be updated to clearly explain that this function is specifically for holiday observance rules, not for finding the next Monday in general. The docstring should explicitly state that weekdays are returned unchanged and perhaps even mention that the name is historical and maintained for backward compatibility. This provides the clearest path forward without breaking existing code while acknowledging the naming issue.
