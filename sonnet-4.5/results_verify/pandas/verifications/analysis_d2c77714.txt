## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None. The bug is real and contradicts documented behavior.

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The documentation explicitly states "file format is inferred from file extension"
- A file extension is the suffix after the last dot, not any substring in the filename
- The implementation clearly uses substring matching (`in` operator) instead of extension checking
- Test cases demonstrate incorrect behavior that violates reasonable user expectations

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- One could argue users shouldn't name files with ".xpt" or ".sas7bdat" in the middle
- The current behavior has been in place and changing it might break existing code

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - backup files like "data.xpt.backup" are common
- The behavior directly contradicts the documentation
- This can lead to confusing errors when users have legitimate reasons for these naming patterns
- The fix is simple and makes the code more correct

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- If the intention was to allow substring matching, the documentation could be updated

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation correctly describes standard file extension behavior
- Changing documentation to say "checks if filename contains .xpt or .sas7bdat" would be misleading and non-standard
- File extension checking is the universally expected behavior
- The code should be fixed to match the documentation, not vice versa

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue proper extension checking is a new feature

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The documentation already promises this behavior ("inferred from file extension")
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- File extension checking is standard behavior, not a new feature

### Considering BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Documentation mismatch**: Code behavior contradicts explicit documentation that says "file format is inferred from file extension"
2. **Incorrect logic**: Using `in` operator checks for substring presence, not file extension
3. **User impact**: Causes incorrect format detection for legitimate filenames like:
   - Backup files: "data.xpt.backup"
   - Versioned files: "data.sas7bdat.old"
   - Files with the substring in the middle: "my.xpt_notes.txt"
4. **Clear fix**: The fix is straightforward - use `endswith()` instead of `in`
5. **Standard expectations**: File extension checking is universally understood to mean checking the suffix, not substring matching

### Final Assessment

This is a clear **BUG**. The implementation uses substring matching when it should use file extension checking, directly contradicting the documented behavior and violating standard file handling conventions. The bug has real user impact and a straightforward fix.
