## Documentation Analysis for pandas.core.algorithms.factorize

### Official Documentation Contract
The official pandas documentation for `factorize` explicitly states:

**Key Contract:**
"codes : ndarray - An integer ndarray that's an indexer into `uniques`. `uniques.take(codes)` will have the same values as `values`."

This is a clear, unambiguous promise that the function guarantees round-trip preservation of values.

### Documentation Findings

1. **Explicit Round-Trip Guarantee**
   - The documentation explicitly promises that `uniques.take(codes)` will equal the original `values`
   - This is stated both in the help text and the online documentation
   - There are no caveats or exceptions mentioned for special characters or null bytes

2. **No Special String Handling Mentioned**
   - The documentation does not mention any special handling or limitations for strings containing null characters
   - No warnings about C-style string termination issues
   - No exclusions for binary data or control characters in strings

3. **Expected Behavior for Distinct Values**
   - The documentation states factorize is for "identifying distinct values"
   - In Python, '' and '\x00' are distinct values (different lengths, different content)
   - Therefore, they should receive different codes

4. **Related Known Issues**
   - GitHub issue #34551 confirms similar null byte handling issues in pandas
   - Pandas maintainer Joris van den Bossche confirmed this class of bugs as valid
   - The issue affects multiple pandas operations using StringHashTable

5. **No Documented Workarounds or Limitations**
   - The documentation doesn't warn users about null character limitations
   - No alternative methods suggested for handling strings with null bytes
   - No mention that strings are treated as C-style null-terminated internally

### Conclusion
The bug violates the explicitly documented contract of the factorize function. The documentation makes an unqualified promise about round-trip capability that is broken when strings contain null characters. This is not a case of undefined or unspecified behavior - it's a direct violation of the documented guarantee.
