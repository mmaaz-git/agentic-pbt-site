## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The documentation explicitly and unambiguously states "The output will always be a SparseArray"
- The actual implementation returns a numpy.ndarray for non-SparseDtype conversions
- This is a clear contract violation between documented and actual behavior
- The docstring even provides guidance that numpy.asarray() should be used for dense array conversion, implying astype() should NOT do this
- Users relying on the documented behavior will encounter unexpected TypeErrors
- The behavior is inconsistent - sometimes returns SparseArray, sometimes ndarray

**Why it's definitely a BUG:**
- There's no ambiguity in the documentation - it uses the word "always"
- The issue affects a public API method with clear documentation
- The fix is straightforward and aligns with documented behavior

### INVALID (Not a valid bug)
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- (No strong arguments for this - the documentation is crystal clear)

### WONTFIX (Won't be fixed)
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Comment "# GH#34457" suggests this might be intentional behavior from a previous GitHub issue
- Changing this behavior could break existing code that relies on the current implementation

**Why it's probably NOT WONTFIX:**
- The documentation contract is explicit and unambiguous
- Breaking documented contracts is more serious than breaking undocumented behavior
- The sparse array ecosystem expects type consistency

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation error)
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The comment "# GH#34457" suggests the current behavior might be intentional
- Perhaps the documentation should be updated to reflect the actual behavior
- The implementation might be correct and the documentation wrong

**Why it's probably NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation is consistent across multiple places
- The design intent is clear - maintain sparse structure unless explicitly converting with numpy.asarray()
- Multiple examples in the docstring show SparseArray being returned

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New feature)
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- (No arguments for this - the documentation already promises this behavior)

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The documentation makes an explicit, unambiguous promise that "The output will always be a SparseArray" and the implementation violates this promise. The fact that there's a comment referencing a GitHub issue (#34457) suggests this might have been a deliberate change, but if so, the documentation should have been updated. Since the documentation wasn't updated and still makes this promise, the current behavior is a bug that violates the documented contract.
