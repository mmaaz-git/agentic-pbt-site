DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

After reviewing the pandas documentation for hash_array, here are my findings:

1. OFFICIAL FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
   The docstring states:
   ```
   hash_key : str, default _default_hash_key
       Hash_key for string key to encode.
   ```

2. KEY OBSERVATION - MISLEADING DOCUMENTATION:
   The documentation says "Hash_key for string key to encode" which could be interpreted two ways:
   a) It's a key used when encoding strings (i.e., only for string arrays)
   b) It's a string-typed key used for encoding (general purpose)

   The phrasing is ambiguous but leans toward interpretation (a).

3. DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR:
   - The function is documented to return "deterministic integers" for a 1d array
   - The hash_key parameter is listed as affecting the output
   - No explicit limitation is mentioned that hash_key only works for certain data types
   - The example in the docs shows hashing numeric arrays but doesn't demonstrate hash_key usage

4. API CONTRACT IMPLICATIONS:
   - The function signature accepts hash_key as a parameter for ALL array types
   - There's no warning or note that hash_key is ignored for numeric arrays
   - The parameter description "for string key to encode" is vague and could mean:
     * "this string key is used for encoding" (general)
     * "this key is for encoding strings" (specific to string arrays)

5. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
   - No clear statement about when hash_key is actually used
   - No examples showing hash_key with different values
   - No warning that hash_key doesn't affect numeric array hashing
   - The relationship between hash_key and different data types is not explained

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is insufficient and potentially misleading. While it hints that hash_key might be for strings ("for string key to encode"), it doesn't explicitly state that the parameter is ignored for numeric arrays. Users would reasonably expect that providing different hash_key values would produce different hashes for ANY array type, since:
1. The parameter is accepted for all inputs
2. No type restrictions are documented
3. The function is meant to produce "deterministic" hashes (implying the key affects determinism)
