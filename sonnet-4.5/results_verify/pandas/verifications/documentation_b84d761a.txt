Based on my analysis of the AbstractMethodError documentation:

1. **Official Documentation**: The pandas documentation shows that AbstractMethodError is designed to be raised instead of NotImplementedError for abstract methods. The examples in the documentation demonstrate its usage with both class methods and instance methods.

2. **Constructor Parameters**:
   - `class_instance`: This parameter accepts either a class (for classmethod) or an instance (for regular methods)
   - `methodtype`: A string parameter that should be one of "method", "classmethod", "staticmethod", or "property" (default is "method")

3. **Example from Documentation**:
   The docstring example at line 290 shows an interesting issue - it says the error message will be "This classmethod must be defined in the concrete class Foo" for BOTH the classmethod case AND the instance method case, which appears to be incorrect (likely a documentation error itself).

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The error should validate that methodtype is one of the allowed values
   - The __str__ method should generate an appropriate error message based on the methodtype
   - For classmethod, it should use the class name directly
   - For other method types, it should use the type of the instance

5. **Key Observations**:
   - The documentation does NOT specify that when methodtype='classmethod', the class_instance must be a class object
   - The documentation does NOT specify the exact format of validation error messages
   - The example in the docstring appears to have a copy-paste error (line 290-291)
   - There is no explicit requirement about parameter ordering in error messages
