## Reproduction Results

### Bug Report Claim
The bug report claims that `categorical_column_to_series` uses modulo arithmetic to silently remap out-of-bounds categorical codes, causing data corruption.

### Reproduction Tests

1. **Basic reproduction test confirmed the behavior**:
   - Input codes: [0, 1, 100, 200] with 3 categories ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
   - Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'cherry']
   - Code 100 → 100 % 3 = 1 → 'banana'
   - Code 200 → 200 % 3 = 2 → 'cherry'

2. **Modulo operation verified**:
   - The function does use `categories[codes % len(categories)]` at line 254
   - This applies to ALL codes, including out-of-bounds values
   - Python's modulo: -1 % 3 = 2, 100 % 3 = 1, 200 % 3 = 2

3. **Critical finding about sentinel values**:
   - The code comment says modulo is to handle "out-of-bounds sentinel values"
   - BUT the modulo prevents proper null detection!
   - Example: sentinel -1 gets mapped to categories[2] instead of becoming NaN
   - The `set_nulls` function can't identify the sentinel after modulo transformation

4. **Pandas' own Categorical behavior**:
   - `pd.Categorical.from_codes()` accepts ONLY -1 as null indicator
   - Raises `ValueError` for any other out-of-bounds codes
   - Message: "codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1"
   - Does NOT use modulo arithmetic

### Technical Accuracy
The bug report is technically correct:
- The modulo operation DOES occur
- It DOES silently remap out-of-bounds codes
- This IS different from pandas' standard categorical behavior
- The current implementation fails to properly handle sentinel values as intended
