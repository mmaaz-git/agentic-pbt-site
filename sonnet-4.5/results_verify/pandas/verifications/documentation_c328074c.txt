DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR PANDAS.CUT
=====================================

## Official Documentation Review

### Parameter Requirements

The pandas.cut documentation states for the 'x' parameter:
- "x : array-like - The input array to be binned. Must be 1-dimensional."

This is the ONLY requirement specified for the input array. The documentation does NOT:
- Exclude denormal/subnormal floating-point numbers
- Specify any precision limitations
- Mention any restrictions on the range of values
- Warn about potential issues with extreme value ranges

### Expected Behavior

According to the documentation:
- "Any NA values will be NA in the result"
- "Out of bounds values will be NA in the resulting Series or Categorical object"
- The function should "bin values into discrete intervals"

The input [2.2250738585e-313, -1.0] meets all documented requirements:
1. It's array-like (a Python list)
2. It's 1-dimensional
3. Contains no NA values
4. Contains valid numeric values

### Error Handling

The documentation mentions one specific error condition:
- "duplicates : {default 'raise', 'drop'}" for handling non-unique bin edges

The documentation does NOT mention:
- Errors for denormal floats
- Errors for extreme value ranges
- "missing values must be missing in the same location" errors

### IEEE 754 Context

Denormal (subnormal) numbers are:
- Valid IEEE 754 floating-point numbers
- Part of the official standard for gradual underflow
- Expected to work in floating-point arithmetic (though possibly with performance penalties)

The value 2.2250738585e-313 is a valid float64 denormal number.

### IntervalArray._validate Documentation

The internal _validate method checks:
- "left and right have the same missing values"

This is where the error originates, but this is an INTERNAL validation that should not fail when:
1. The user provides valid numeric input
2. The function internally creates intervals that fail its own validation

## Documentation Conclusions

1. The bug report's assertion is correct: The input satisfies all documented requirements
2. The error message is misleading: It talks about "missing values" when none were provided
3. The documentation provides no warning about denormal floats or extreme ranges
4. This represents a failure to handle valid IEEE 754 numeric input

The function crashes on valid input that meets all documented requirements, with an internal error message that doesn't reflect the actual issue. This is not a documentation problem - the documentation correctly states what inputs are accepted, and the provided input meets those requirements.
