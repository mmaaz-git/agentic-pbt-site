Bug Reproduction Results

SUMMARY:
The bug report is TECHNICALLY CORRECT. The function does crash with IndexError when given a DataFrame with no numeric columns besides the class column.

TEST RESULTS:

1. DataFrame with only class column ({'class': ['a', 'b', 'c']}):
   - Result: IndexError: list index out of range
   - Location: misc.py:421 in ax.set_xlim(x[0], x[-1])
   - This matches the bug report exactly

2. DataFrame with numeric column but empty cols list:
   - Result: IndexError: list index out of range
   - Same error location
   - This also triggers the bug when cols=[] is explicitly passed

3. Normal case with numeric columns:
   - Result: SUCCESS - Returns Axes object as expected
   - Function works properly when there are numeric columns

HYPOTHESIS TEST:
- Ran the provided hypothesis test with n_rows from 0 to 10
- ALL cases resulted in IndexError (not ValueError as the test expects)
- The error occurs consistently regardless of the number of rows

ROOT CAUSE VERIFIED:
The bug occurs at line 421 in parallel_coordinates:
```python
ax.set_xlim(x[0], x[-1])
```

When there are no columns to plot:
- ncols = 0 (line 376)
- x = list(range(0)) = [] (line 391)
- Accessing x[0] on empty list causes IndexError

BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS:
1. The function currently crashes with a cryptic IndexError
2. The bug report suggests it should raise a clearer ValueError
3. The current error provides no useful information to users about what went wrong

The bug report's technical description is accurate - the function does crash when there are no numeric columns to plot, and it crashes exactly where and how the report describes.
