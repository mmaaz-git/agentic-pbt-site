TRIAGE ANALYSIS

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID - Why it might be INVALID:
   - The function is internal (pandas.core.util) and not part of the public API
   - Users shouldn't be directly calling internal functions
   - Internal functions may have undocumented assumptions

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The function is importable and accessible to users
   - Even internal functions should handle errors gracefully or document preconditions
   - The error message is confusing and doesn't indicate the actual problem

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - This is an internal function that users shouldn't directly use
   - All internal pandas code correctly passes same-length arrays
   - The function works correctly for its intended internal use cases
   - Adding validation might slow down internal operations

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - The fix is trivial (a simple length check)
   - The current error is confusing even for developers
   - Better error messages improve debuggability

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Supporting different-length arrays could be seen as a new feature
   - The function was never designed to handle mismatched lengths

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The report isn't asking for new functionality
   - It's asking for proper error handling of invalid input
   - The suggestion is to fail gracefully, not to support the case

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The docstring doesn't mention the same-length requirement
   - Adding documentation would clarify the precondition
   - The function works correctly when used as intended

   Why it might need MORE than documentation:
   - Even with documentation, the confusing error remains
   - Good API design includes validating preconditions
   - The suggested fix includes both documentation AND validation

5. BUG - Why it IS a BUG:
   - The function crashes with a confusing error instead of validating input
   - The precondition is undocumented
   - The error message doesn't help users understand what went wrong
   - Even internal functions should fail gracefully with clear errors
   - The fix is simple and improves code quality

FINAL ASSESSMENT:

This is best categorized as DOCUMENTATION_FIX because:

1. The function is internal (pandas.core.util) and not part of the public API
2. All internal uses correctly provide same-length arrays
3. The function works as designed for its intended internal use
4. The issue is that the precondition isn't documented

While adding validation would be nice, the primary issue is the missing documentation. Internal functions don't necessarily need to validate all inputs if they're only called by controlled internal code. The lack of documentation about the same-length requirement is the real problem that needs fixing.
