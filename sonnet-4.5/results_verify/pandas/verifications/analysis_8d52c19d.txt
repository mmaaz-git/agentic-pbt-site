BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Considering each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report):
   Arguments FOR:
   - The docstring explicitly states "The output will always be a SparseArray"
   - This is a clear, unambiguous contract that the method violates
   - The behavior breaks reasonable user expectations based on documentation
   - The roundtrip pattern (convert to float, then back to int) fails unexpectedly
   - This is not an edge case - it affects all usage with plain numpy dtypes

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The behavior appears intentional based on GH#34457 comment
   - There might be performance reasons for returning ndarray

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report):
   Arguments FOR:
   - The implementation seems deliberate, with a specific GitHub issue reference

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation is crystal clear about always returning SparseArray
   - There's no ambiguity in the documented behavior
   - The report accurately describes the actual vs documented behavior

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting):
   Arguments FOR:
   - Users can work around by using SparseDtype explicitly

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is not a trivial issue - it's a fundamental API contract violation
   - The inconsistency affects common use cases (dtype conversion)
   - It breaks expected patterns like roundtripping

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality):
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could be viewed as requesting support for plain numpy dtypes

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation already claims this is supported behavior
   - This is about fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new features

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error):
   Arguments FOR:
   - The easiest fix would be to update the documentation to match implementation
   - The implementation appears to be intentional based on GH#34457

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation makes a clear promise that users rely on
   - Changing documentation would be a breaking change to the API contract
   - The docstring examples all show SparseArray being returned

CONCLUSION:
This is clearly a case where the implementation violates the documented API contract. The documentation unambiguously states "The output will always be a SparseArray" but the code returns ndarray for non-SparseDtype inputs.

While this could theoretically be fixed by updating the documentation (DOCUMENTATION_FIX), the more appropriate categorization is BUG because:
1. The documented behavior is the expected and logical behavior
2. Users would reasonably expect astype() on a SparseArray to return a SparseArray
3. The current behavior breaks common patterns like roundtripping
4. The fix should be to make the code match the documentation, not vice versa
