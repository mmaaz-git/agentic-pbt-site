## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior could potentially be considered "by design" if SparseArrays were intended to treat all fill_value elements as conceptually "empty" rather than actual values. In this interpretation, when the fill_value changes, these "empty" positions would naturally take on the new fill_value. This would be a design choice about how sparse arrays handle their compression format.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly shows an example where values equal to the fill_value are preserved during astype operations. The documented example at lines 1287-1292 shows [0, 0, 1, 2] with fill_value=0 correctly becoming [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0] with fill_value=0.0. The zeros are preserved. Additionally, the fundamental principle of astype() in NumPy and pandas is to preserve values while changing their type representation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The edge case only occurs when all values in the array equal the fill_value, which could be considered a degenerate case. Users could work around this by using regular NumPy arrays when they don't need sparsity. The fix might require significant refactoring of how SparseArrays handle their internal representation, which could be deemed too complex for an edge case.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a data corruption bug that silently changes user data without warning. It violates a fundamental invariant that astype should preserve values. The bug affects real use cases where users might have sparse data that happens to contain regions of the fill_value. Silent data corruption is generally considered a serious issue that should be fixed.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the current behavior is intentional, the documentation should be updated to warn users that values equal to fill_value will be replaced when changing fill_value during astype. The documentation example could be misleading as it doesn't show the problematic case.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation's own example contradicts the buggy behavior. The documented example shows that values should be preserved even when they equal the fill_value. Changing the documentation to match the buggy behavior would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that preserving values when changing fill_value is a new feature that wasn't originally implemented. The request would be to add support for this use case.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The astype() method already exists and has documented behavior. This isn't asking for new functionality but for the existing functionality to work correctly according to its documented behavior and the general contract of astype operations.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The behavior directly contradicts the documentation's example. It violates the fundamental invariant that sparse.astype(dtype).to_dense() should equal sparse.to_dense().astype(dtype). It causes silent data corruption where user values are replaced without warning. The astype() method in NumPy and pandas universally preserves values while changing types, and this violates that contract.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against it being a bug would be if this was an intentional design decision about how sparse arrays handle fill_values, but there's no documentation supporting this interpretation.

## Overall consideration
After careful analysis, this is clearly a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming:

First, the documented behavior explicitly shows that values should be preserved during astype operations, even when those values equal the fill_value. The documentation example at lines 1287-1292 demonstrates [0, 0, 1, 2] with fill_value=0 correctly becoming [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0], preserving all the zeros. The current implementation violates this documented behavior.

Second, this violates the fundamental contract of astype() operations throughout NumPy and pandas, which is to preserve values while changing their type representation. The bug causes silent data corruption where actual user data values are replaced with different values without any warning or error. This breaks the mathematical invariant that converting to dense, then changing type should give the same result as changing type then converting to dense.

Third, the technical explanation in the bug report correctly identifies the root cause: when all values equal the fill_value, the sparse representation has empty sp_values and sp_index arrays. The current astype implementation fails to handle this case and incorrectly assumes empty sp_values means there are no actual values to preserve. This is a clear logic error in the implementation that needs to be fixed to match the documented and expected behavior.
