DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function Location and Nature:
-----------------------------
- Function: pandas.core.dtypes.common.ensure_str
- This is an internal utility function in pandas, NOT a public API function
- It is not documented in the official pandas API reference
- The function is imported and used internally by other pandas modules (e.g., pandas/io/json/_json.py)

Function Documentation (from source code):
------------------------------------------
The entire documentation for this function consists of a single docstring:
```
def ensure_str(value: bytes | Any) -> str:
    """
    Ensure that bytes and non-strings get converted into ``str`` objects.
    """
```

Key Documentation Findings:
---------------------------
1. The docstring states the function should "Ensure that bytes and non-strings get converted into str objects"
2. The type signature accepts `bytes | Any` and promises to return `str`
3. There are NO documented preconditions about the bytes needing to be valid UTF-8
4. There is NO documentation about what errors might be raised
5. There is NO specification of encoding assumptions

Python's bytes.decode() Behavior:
----------------------------------
From the official Python documentation (codecs module):
- The default error handling for decode() is 'strict'
- 'strict' causes UnicodeDecodeError to be raised for invalid UTF-8 bytes
- The 'replace' error handling would substitute invalid bytes with ï¿½ (U+FFFD)
- Other options include 'ignore', 'backslashreplace', and 'surrogateescape'

Documentation Conclusion:
------------------------
The function's documentation makes an unconditional promise: it will convert bytes to str objects. It does not specify:
- That the bytes must be valid UTF-8
- That UnicodeDecodeError might be raised
- What encoding is assumed for the bytes

Given that the function accepts ANY bytes object according to its type signature and documentation, the current behavior of crashing on invalid UTF-8 bytes violates the documented contract.
