## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The implementation clearly doesn't respect timeout values ≤ 0.01s
- timeout=0 is a common pattern meaning "don't wait" or "check once immediately"
- Users setting timeout=0.001 expect 1ms timeout, not 10ms
- The fix is straightforward (move timeout check before sleep)
- This affects real use cases (fine-grained timing control, immediate timeout needs)
- The behavior is counterintuitive and violates principle of least surprise

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise immediate timeout for timeout=0
- The 10ms polling interval could be considered an implementation detail
- Could argue that any positive work requires some minimum time

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly define behavior for timeout≤0
- Could argue negative timeouts are undefined behavior
- The functions technically work, just with different precision than expected

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- timeout=0 has well-established meaning in programming (immediate/no wait)
- Users have reasonable expectations that aren't met
- The implementation accepts these values without error

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- 10ms precision might be "good enough" for clipboard monitoring
- Very few users likely need sub-10ms clipboard timeout precision
- The polling interval of 10ms might be intentional to avoid CPU spinning

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (move one if statement)
- This isn't about obscure edge cases - timeout=0 is common
- Users explicitly setting small timeouts clearly care about precision
- No performance impact from fixing this

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame as "add support for immediate timeout (timeout=0)"
- Could frame as "add fine-grained timeout precision support"
- Documentation doesn't promise this behavior currently

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already accepts these timeout values
- The current behavior is a bug in the implementation logic
- timeout=0 should already work correctly

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that minimum timeout is 10ms
- Could document that timeout≤0 behaves same as timeout=0.01
- Could add note about polling interval affecting precision

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it
- The fix is simple and makes more sense than documenting limitations
- Users shouldn't have to accept a 10ms minimum timeout
- Would be admitting defeat rather than fixing the problem

### Analysis Summary

The issue is clearly a logic bug in the implementation where the timeout check occurs after the sleep instead of before it. This causes all timeouts ≤ 0.01s to take at least 0.01s.

Key factors:
1. **Intent**: timeout=0 universally means "immediate" in programming
2. **Expectations**: Users expect timeout values to be respected
3. **Impact**: Real use cases are affected (immediate timeout, fine-grained control)
4. **Fix**: Trivial to fix by reordering the timeout check
5. **Severity**: Low severity but clear correctness issue

### Recommendation: BUG

This should be categorized as a **BUG** because:

1. The implementation contains a clear logic error (checking timeout after sleep)
2. It violates reasonable and common programming expectations (timeout=0 = immediate)
3. The function accepts these values but doesn't handle them correctly
4. The fix is straightforward and improves correctness
5. While the severity is low, it's still incorrect behavior that should be fixed

This is not merely a documentation issue or feature request - it's a bug in the implementation logic that causes incorrect timing behavior.
