## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. Undocumented side effect: The function mutates its input without any documentation warning
2. Violates principle of least surprise: A formatting function should not modify its inputs
3. Real-world impact: Users who reuse the allowed_args list will experience unexpected behavior
4. Clear fix available: Simply copy the list before mutating (minimal code change)
5. Reproducible: Both test cases clearly demonstrate the issue
6. Runtime mutation: The mutation happens during function calls, not at decoration time, making it harder to debug

**Strength: STRONG** - This appears to be a legitimate bug that violates both documented behavior and Python conventions.

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. Could argue it's an internal function (_format_argument_list starts with underscore)
2. Users might not be expected to reuse the allowed_args list

**Strength: WEAK** - The function is used by a public decorator API, and Python developers reasonably expect functions not to mutate their inputs without documentation.

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. The issue only affects users who reuse the allowed_args list
2. Workaround exists: users can pass a copy of the list
3. Function has been working this way for a while without major complaints

**Strength: WEAK** - The fix is trivial (one line change), and the bug violates fundamental programming principles. The impact may be limited but the principle is important.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Could document that the list will be mutated instead of fixing the code
2. Add warning to deprecate_nonkeyword_arguments about list mutation

**Strength: WEAK** - Documenting bad behavior doesn't make it acceptable. The mutation serves no useful purpose and is clearly an implementation oversight.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could be seen as requesting new behavior (non-mutating function)

**Strength: VERY WEAK** - This is clearly a bug fix, not a feature request. Functions should not mutate their inputs unless that's their explicit purpose.

### Final Assessment
This is a **BUG**. The function has an undocumented side effect that violates both Python conventions and user expectations. The mutation:
1. Is not documented
2. Serves no useful purpose
3. Happens at an unexpected time (runtime, not decoration time)
4. Can cause real problems for users who reuse lists
5. Has a trivial fix

The fact that it's a helper function doesn't excuse the behavior - it's used by a public API (deprecate_nonkeyword_arguments) and should follow proper conventions. The fix is simple and non-breaking: copy the list before mutating it.
