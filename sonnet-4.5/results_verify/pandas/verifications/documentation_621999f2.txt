## Documentation Findings for pandas.core.indexes.api.safe_sort_index

### Function Location and Status
- `safe_sort_index` is an **internal pandas function** located in `pandas.core.indexes.api`
- It is NOT part of the public pandas API (not accessible via `pd.safe_sort_index`)
- This function exists in pandas 2.3.2 and is part of the internal implementation

### Current Documentation (Docstring)
The function's docstring states:
```
Returns the sorted index

We keep the dtypes and the name attributes.

Parameters
----------
index : an Index

Returns
-------
Index
```

### Implementation Analysis
Looking at the source code, the function:
1. First checks if the index is already monotonic increasing and returns it as-is if true
2. Attempts to call `safe_sort(index)` which is another internal function
3. **Catches TypeError** if the sorting fails (e.g., due to incomparable elements)
4. If a TypeError occurs, the function returns the **original unsorted index**

### Key Documentation Issue
The docstring says "Returns the sorted index" without any qualification or mention that:
- The function may return an unsorted index when elements are incomparable
- A TypeError during sorting will result in the original index being returned
- The "safe" in the function name implies it handles error cases, but this isn't documented

### Related Functions
- `safe_sort` (also in pandas.core.algorithms) is documented to handle mixed types safely
- The public API provides `DataFrame.sort_index()` and `Series.sort_index()` for user-facing sorting

### Conclusion
The documentation (docstring) is incomplete and misleading. It claims to return "the sorted index" without mentioning that the function may return an unsorted index when sorting is not possible due to incomparable elements. The actual behavior is to catch TypeErrors and return the original index unchanged, which is not documented at all.
