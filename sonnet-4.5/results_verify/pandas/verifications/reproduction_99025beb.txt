## Bug Reproduction Report

### Hypothesis Test Results
The Hypothesis property-based test from the bug report was executed and it FAILED as reported:
- Test expected all empty or whitespace-only strings to raise ValueError
- Test failed on input ' ' (single space)
- The failure confirms that whitespace-only strings are NOT raising ValueError as expected

### Direct Function Test (_check_expression)
Testing _check_expression directly confirms the issue:
- Empty string "" correctly raises ValueError: "expr cannot be an empty string"
- Single space " " does NOT raise ValueError (passes check)
- Tab "\t" does NOT raise ValueError (passes check)
- Newline "\n" does NOT raise ValueError (passes check)
- Carriage return "\r" does NOT raise ValueError (passes check)
- Mixed whitespace "  \t\n  " does NOT raise ValueError (passes check)

### pandas.eval() Behavior Test
Testing pandas.eval() with the same inputs shows inconsistent behavior:
- Empty string "" correctly raises ValueError: "expr cannot be an empty string"
- Single space " " returns None (no error, no valid result)
- Tab "\t" returns None (no error, no valid result)
- Newline "\n" returns None (no error, no valid result)
- Carriage return "\r" returns None (no error, no valid result)

### Code Analysis
Looking at the implementation in pandas/core/computation/eval.py:
1. Line 122-123: _check_expression uses `if not expr:` which only checks truthiness
   - Empty string "" is falsy, so it raises ValueError
   - Whitespace strings like " " are truthy, so they pass the check

2. Line 307: After _check_expression, the code does:
   ```python
   exprs = [e.strip() for e in expr.splitlines() if e.strip() != ""]
   ```
   - For whitespace-only input, this produces an empty list []
   - The loop at line 326 `for expr in exprs:` never executes
   - The function eventually returns None at line 421

### Confirmed Bug
The bug report is ACCURATE:
- There is inconsistent behavior between empty string and whitespace-only strings
- _check_expression's implementation doesn't match its documented intent
- pandas.eval() returns None for whitespace input instead of raising an error
- The proposed fix (checking `not expr or not expr.strip()`) would address this inconsistency
