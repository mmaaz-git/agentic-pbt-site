## Documentation Analysis for InfinityType

This code is vendored from the PyPA packaging library (as stated in the header comments of the file). The InfinityType class is used internally for version comparison ordering in the packaging library.

Key findings:

1. **Purpose**: InfinityType represents a mathematical infinity value used for version comparison sorting. It's used internally in the version comparison logic to represent values that should sort after everything else (like a version without a dev segment should sort after those with one).

2. **Current upstream behavior**: I checked the current packaging library source on GitHub, and the __gt__ method still returns True unconditionally in the upstream implementation. This is the same behavior as in pandas' vendored copy.

3. **No public documentation**: The InfinityType class is not documented in the public packaging documentation (packaging.pypa.io). It appears to be an internal implementation detail used for version comparison sorting.

4. **Design intent**: The class is designed to always be "greater than" any other value to facilitate version sorting. The comparison methods are:
   - __lt__ and __le__ always return False (Infinity is never less than anything)
   - __gt__ and __ge__ always return True (Infinity is always greater than anything)
   - __eq__ returns True only when comparing with another InfinityType instance
   - __ne__ returns True when not comparing with another InfinityType instance

5. **Usage context**: In the code, Infinity is used in the _cmpkey function for version sorting logic. For example, when a version has no pre-release segment, it uses Infinity to ensure it sorts after versions with pre-release segments.

The implementation appears intentional - Infinity is meant to be a special value that is always greater than any other value, including itself, for the purpose of version comparison sorting algorithms.
