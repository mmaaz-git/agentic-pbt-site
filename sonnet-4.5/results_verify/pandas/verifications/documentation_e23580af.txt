## Documentation Analysis Report

### Key Documentation Found

1. **format_percentiles Docstring** (pandas/io/formats/format.py, lines 1562-1564):
   > "Rounding precision is chosen so that: (1) if any two elements of `percentiles` differ, they remain different after rounding"

   This is an explicit guarantee in the function's documentation that is being violated.

2. **Additional Documentation Notes**:
   - Line 1575: "Duplicates are allowed" - but this refers to intentional duplicates in input, not unintentional duplicates created by rounding
   - The example shows handling of [0, 0.5, 0.02001, 0.5, 0.666666, 0.9999] where 0.5 appears twice intentionally

3. **_refine_percentiles Documentation** (pandas/core/methods/describe.py):
   - States: "Ensure that percentiles are unique and sorted"
   - Line 414: Raises ValueError("percentiles cannot contain duplicates")
   - This shows the system expects unique percentiles after refinement

4. **Public API Documentation** (pandas.DataFrame.describe):
   - Only states percentiles should be "between 0 and 1"
   - Does not mention handling of very close percentiles
   - Does not document the failure mode with duplicate labels

### Documentation Interpretation

The docstring for `format_percentiles` makes an explicit promise:
- **"if any two elements of percentiles differ, they remain different after rounding"**

This is a clear, unambiguous statement about the function's behavior. The bug report correctly identifies that this promise is violated when percentiles like [0.01, 0.010000000000000002] are provided.

The function's documented behavior is that:
1. Different inputs should produce different outputs
2. The only exception is when inputs are intentionally the same

The current implementation fails to meet this documented specification, making this a legitimate bug rather than undefined behavior or a documentation issue.
