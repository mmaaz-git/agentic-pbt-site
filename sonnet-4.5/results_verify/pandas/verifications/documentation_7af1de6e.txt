DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. PANDAS DOCUMENTATION ON read_json():
   - The official pandas documentation for read_json() does NOT specify any limitations on integer ranges
   - It mentions using "ujson" as the default parsing engine
   - It provides dtype control options but doesn't mention int64/uint64 overflow behavior
   - No documentation about asymmetric handling of values outside int64 range
   - No warnings about ValueError for numbers below int64_min

2. JSON SPECIFICATION (RFC 8259):
   According to RFC 8259:
   - JSON allows arbitrary precision numbers in theory
   - The spec explicitly states: "An implementation may set limits on the range and precision of numbers"
   - For interoperability, suggests using IEEE 754 binary64 (double precision) range
   - Numbers in range [-(2^53)+1, (2^53)-1] are guaranteed interoperable
   - Numbers outside typical ranges "may indicate potential interoperability problems"

   CRITICAL POINT: The JSON specification explicitly allows implementations to set numeric limits, but does NOT require any specific behavior for overflow/underflow.

3. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BUG:
   a) JSON validity: Both -9223372036854775809 and 9223372036854775808 are VALID JSON numbers per the specification

   b) Implementation freedom: The JSON spec allows pandas/ujson to set limits, BUT:
      - The limits should be documented
      - The behavior should be consistent (not asymmetric)

   c) Missing documentation: pandas does not document:
      - That values below int64_min will raise ValueError
      - That values above int64_max will be converted to uint64
      - The asymmetric nature of this behavior

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   Based on the documentation and specifications:
   - Users would expect either BOTH overflows to work or BOTH to fail
   - The asymmetric behavior is not documented anywhere
   - The ValueError for negative overflow is undocumented

CONCLUSION: The pandas documentation does not specify or warn about this asymmetric integer overflow behavior, making the current implementation's behavior unexpected and undocumented.
