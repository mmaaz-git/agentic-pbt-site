## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in the issue. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report failed as expected when run with the specific input `lists_of_ints=[[0]], index=1`. The test expects that accessing an out-of-bounds index should return NaN/NA for lists that don't have that index, but instead it raises an ArrowInvalid exception.

Error: `ArrowInvalid: Index 1 is out of bounds: should be in [0, 1)`

### Manual Example Reproduction
The manual example also reproduced the issue:

```python
s = pd.Series([[1, 2, 3], [4]], dtype=pd.ArrowDtype(pa.list_(pa.int64())))
s.list[0]  # Works: returns [1, 4]
s.list[1]  # Fails: ArrowInvalid: Index 1 is out of bounds: should be in [0, 1)
```

The error occurs because the second list [4] only has one element (at index 0), and attempting to access index 1 fails.

### Root Cause
The underlying issue is that `pandas.core.arrays.arrow.accessors.ListAccessor.__getitem__()` directly calls `pyarrow.compute.list_element()`, which requires the index to be valid for ALL lists in the array. When any list is shorter than the requested index, PyArrow raises an ArrowInvalid exception.

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: For lists that don't have the requested index, return NA/null (similar to how Series.str accessor works)
- **Actual**: Raises an ArrowInvalid exception if ANY list is too short for the requested index

The behavior is inconsistent with how pandas typically handles out-of-bounds access in other similar contexts (e.g., string accessor returns NaN for out-of-bounds indices).
