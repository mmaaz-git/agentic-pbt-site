## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Results:

1. **Bug report claims are ACCURATE**:
   - Separators like '**', '++', '0(', '0)', '[[' DO cause re.PatternError exceptions
   - The exact error messages match what the report claimed
   - Both read_clipboard() and read_csv() exhibit the same behavior

2. **Technical details confirmed**:
   - Multi-character separators (len > 1) ARE treated as regex patterns
   - Single character separators work fine, even if they are regex metacharacters
   - The python engine is automatically selected for multi-char separators
   - The 'c' engine explicitly rejects multi-char separators with a clear error

3. **Behavior observations**:
   - The '||' separator doesn't work as expected - it's interpreted as regex '|' OR '|' which matches at every position between characters
   - Valid regex patterns like '\s+', '\t+', '[,;]' work correctly
   - Using re.escape() on the separator DOES work as a workaround (e.g., '\\*\\*' for '**')

4. **Error types**:
   - Invalid regex patterns cause re.error (shown as PatternError in pandas)
   - These are low-level regex compilation errors, not user-friendly pandas errors
   - Error messages like "nothing to repeat at position 0" are confusing for users who didn't intend to use regex

5. **Documentation vs Reality**:
   - The behavior IS documented in read_csv: "separators longer than 1 character... will be interpreted as regular expressions"
   - However, read_clipboard's docstring doesn't mention this crucial detail
   - Users would need to follow the reference to read_csv to understand this behavior

### Key Finding:
The bug report accurately describes a real problem: multi-character separators containing regex metacharacters cause confusing errors, and the documentation (especially for read_clipboard) doesn't adequately explain this behavior or provide guidance on how to use literal multi-character separators.
