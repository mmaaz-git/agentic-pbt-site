BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

I will analyze this bug report against each possible triage category:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Documentation explicitly states diagonal accepts only {'hist', 'kde'}
   - The set notation is a clear API contract in Python
   - Current implementation silently accepts invalid values
   - Invalid values result in blank diagonal plots with no error
   - This violates the principle of "fail fast" - errors should be caught early
   - Similar pandas functions validate their enum-like parameters (e.g., merge's 'how' parameter)
   - The proposed fix is simple and non-breaking for valid code

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - None. This is clearly a bug.

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. The bug exists as described.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - Tests confirm the function accepts invalid values
   - Source code review confirms no validation exists
   - Documentation clearly states the restriction

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Users might notice blank diagonals and fix their code
   - The function still produces a scatter matrix (just missing diagonals)

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - This is a clear API contract violation
   - Silent failures make debugging harder
   - Users may not immediately notice the issue
   - Parameter validation is a basic expectation in professional libraries
   - pandas is a major data science library used by millions

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None. The documentation already promises this restriction.

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - This is not asking for new functionality
   - The documentation already defines the expected behavior
   - This is asking for enforcement of documented behavior

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could argue the docs should say "other values are ignored"

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The documentation correctly describes the intended API
   - The implementation is wrong, not the documentation
   - Changing docs to match buggy behavior would be backwards
   - The {'value1', 'value2'} notation has clear meaning in Python

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- Medium severity (as stated in report) is appropriate
- Not critical: doesn't crash or corrupt data
- Not trivial: violates API contract and causes silent failures

RECOMMENDATION:
This should be categorized as BUG. The implementation clearly violates the documented API contract by accepting invalid values without raising an error. The fix is straightforward and would improve the library's robustness and user experience by catching errors early rather than silently producing incorrect output.
