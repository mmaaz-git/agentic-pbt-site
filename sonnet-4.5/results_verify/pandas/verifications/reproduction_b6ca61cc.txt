Bug Reproduction Analysis
========================

The bug report is accurate and reproducible. I have successfully confirmed the issue with pandas' read_csv function when using the chunksize parameter.

## Test Results

1. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - CSV data: "a,b,c\n0,0.0,0\n0,0.0,:\n"
   - Full read column 'c': ['0' ':'] (both values as strings, dtype=object)
   - Chunked read column 'c': [0 ':'] (first value as int, second as string, dtype=object)
   - The values are NOT equal, despite representing the same CSV data

2. Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis:
   - The test found multiple failing cases where numeric strings in mixed columns are inconsistently typed
   - Examples of failing data patterns:
     * Column with ['0', ':'] - '0' becomes int 0 in chunked read
     * Column with ['4', 'A'] - '4' becomes int 4 in chunked read
     * Column with ['4', '?'] - '4' becomes int 4 in chunked read
   - The pattern is consistent: when a chunk contains only numeric-looking strings, pandas infers integer type for that chunk

## Root Cause

The bug occurs because:
1. When reading in chunks, pandas performs type inference independently for each chunk
2. First chunk with value '0' alone is inferred as int64
3. Second chunk with value ':' is inferred as object (string)
4. When concatenating chunks, the mixed types are preserved (int 0 and string ':')
5. Full file read correctly infers the entire column as object type from the start

## Impact

This is a serious bug that causes:
- Silent data corruption (values change without warning)
- Inconsistent behavior based on chunk size
- Violation of the principle that chunked reading should produce identical results to full reads
- Potential for hard-to-debug issues in production systems processing large files
