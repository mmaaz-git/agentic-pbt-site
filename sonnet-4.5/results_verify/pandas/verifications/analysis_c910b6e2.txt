## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The AbstractMethodError class works correctly for its intended purpose - raising errors for abstract methods. The parameter validation is an internal implementation detail that only triggers when developers pass invalid methodtype values. Since the documentation doesn't specify the exact format of parameter validation messages, one could argue this is unspecified behavior and not a bug.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The error message clearly violates standard Python conventions for parameter validation messages. Python consistently uses the pattern "expected X, got Y" across the standard library and major frameworks. The swapped parameters create an objectively confusing message that says "must be one of invalid_value" which is nonsensical.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a trivial issue that only affects error message formatting when invalid parameters are passed to an internal exception class. The AbstractMethodError is primarily raised by library developers implementing abstract methods, not end users. The error still functions correctly - it raises ValueError as expected. The impact is minimal since developers will rarely see this specific validation error, and when they do, they can still understand what went wrong despite the confusing message format.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Error messages are part of the developer experience and should be clear and correct. Even though this is a low-impact issue, it's a simple one-line fix that improves code quality. The pandas library generally maintains high standards for error messages, and this inconsistency stands out as an obvious mistake rather than a design choice.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The pandas documentation doesn't explicitly specify what format error messages should take for parameter validation. One could argue the documentation should be updated to clarify that methodtype accepts only specific values and describe the error behavior for invalid inputs.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue. The error message has objectively swapped parameters in the f-string template. The documentation doesn't need to specify error message formats because Python has well-established conventions that developers expect. Fixing documentation won't solve the confusing error message.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could frame this as requesting better error messages as a new feature - improving the developer experience by making validation errors clearer. The current code "works" in that it raises an error, and we're asking for an enhancement to make that error message better.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't adding new functionality or capabilities. The error message is already supposed to communicate which values are valid and which was provided. The current implementation has the parameters backwards, making it a bug fix rather than a feature request. The intended functionality already exists; it's just implemented incorrectly.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The error message has objectively swapped parameters in the f-string, violating Python's universal convention of "expected X, got Y" format. The message literally says "must be one of [the invalid value]" which is nonsensical and confusing. The fix is trivial and clear - swap the two variables in the f-string. This is an unambiguous implementation error where the code doesn't match the obvious intended behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The error still functionally works - it raises ValueError when invalid parameters are passed. This is an internal validation that most users will never encounter. The AbstractMethodError itself works correctly for its primary purpose. Since the pandas documentation doesn't explicitly promise a specific error message format, this could be considered unspecified behavior rather than a bug.

## Overall Consideration
This bug report identifies a genuine issue where the error message parameters are swapped in the f-string template. The message says "methodtype must be one of invalid_type, got {'method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', 'property'} instead" when it should follow Python's standard convention of stating valid values first, then the actual invalid value received.

However, this is an extremely minor issue that only affects an error message for an internal parameter validation that developers would rarely encounter. The AbstractMethodError class is used by library developers implementing abstract methods, and they would typically use valid methodtype values. The parameter validation is a safety check that most users will never trigger. When they do encounter it, while confusing, they can still understand that they passed an invalid value.

Given that this affects only error message formatting for an edge case validation in an internal exception class, and considering the instruction that these bug reports are usually wrong and should be rejected unless clearly compelling, this should be categorized as WONTFIX. It's technically correct but too trivial to warrant a bug report, especially for error text that developers would rarely if ever see in practice.
