## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation

The functions `waitForPaste` and `waitForNewPaste` in pandas.io.clipboard have the following docstrings:

**waitForPaste**:
"This function call blocks until a non-empty text string exists on the clipboard. It returns this text. This function raises PyperclipTimeoutException if timeout was set to a number of seconds that has elapsed without non-empty text being put on the clipboard."

**waitForNewPaste**:
"This function call blocks until a new text string exists on the clipboard that is different from the text that was there when the function was first called. It returns this text. This function raises PyperclipTimeoutException if timeout was set to a number of seconds that has elapsed without non-empty text being put on the clipboard."

### Key Observations:

1. **Timeout Parameter Type**: The documentation states "timeout was set to a number of seconds" which implies a numeric value is expected. However, it does not specify:
   - What constitutes a valid "number"
   - Whether NaN is acceptable
   - Whether infinity is acceptable
   - Whether negative numbers are acceptable
   - What happens with invalid values

2. **No External Documentation**: Neither the pandas documentation nor the pyperclip documentation provides specific guidance on valid timeout values or edge cases.

3. **Expected Behavior**: The documentation clearly states the function should raise PyperclipTimeoutException when the timeout elapses. For this to work correctly, the timeout value must allow meaningful comparison operations.

4. **Implicit Expectations**: While not explicitly documented, users would reasonably expect:
   - The function to either accept only valid positive numbers, or
   - The function to validate input and reject invalid values with clear error messages
   - The function should not hang indefinitely due to invalid input

### Conclusion on Documentation:

The documentation does not explicitly specify what happens with NaN, infinity, or negative timeout values. However, the phrase "a number of seconds" strongly implies a finite, positive number. The fact that NaN and infinity cause the function to hang forever violates the reasonable expectation that a timeout parameter should actually cause a timeout to occur.
