## Bug Reproduction Report for pandas.io.formats.format.format_percentiles

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. The `format_percentiles` function indeed produces duplicate outputs for unique inputs that are extremely close to each other.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction**
   - Ran the property-based test provided in the bug report
   - The test failed with the error: `AssertionError: Unique inputs produced duplicate outputs: [0.0, 1.3551338041573578e-306] -> ['0%', '0%']`
   - This confirms the property violation

2. **Minimal Example Reproduction**
   - Executed the specific failing example: `[0.0, 7.506590166045388e-253]`
   - Output: `['0%', '0%']`
   - Confirmed that two unique input values produce identical output strings

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pandas_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/io/formats/format.py`
   - The issue occurs at lines 1596-1598 where there's an early return when all percentiles are considered "close to integers"
   - When `np.all(int_idx)` is True, the function returns early without checking for uniqueness
   - In the problematic case:
     - Input: `[0.0, 7.506590166045388e-253]`
     - After multiplying by 100: `[0.0, 7.506590166045388e-251]`
     - Both values round to 0 and are considered "close to integers"
     - The early return path produces `['0%', '0%']` without preserving uniqueness

### Technical Details
The bug occurs because:
1. Very small values like `7.506590166045388e-253` become `7.506590166045388e-251` when multiplied by 100
2. These values round to 0 with the initial precision calculation
3. Both values pass the `np.isclose(percentiles_round_type, percentiles)` test
4. The early return at line 1597 doesn't use the uniqueness-preserving logic that comes later (lines 1600-1601)

### Impact
This bug violates the documented contract of the function which explicitly guarantees that "if any two elements of percentiles differ, they remain different after rounding". This is a clear violation of the function's documented behavior.
