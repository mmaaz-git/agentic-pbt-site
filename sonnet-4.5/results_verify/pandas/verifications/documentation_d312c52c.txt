Documentation Analysis for pandas.tseries.holiday.next_monday
===========================================================

1. Official Documentation:
   - No dedicated API documentation page exists for next_monday
   - Function is not publicly documented in pandas reference API

2. Function Docstring:
   The only documentation is the function's docstring:
   "If holiday falls on Saturday, use following Monday instead;
   if holiday falls on Sunday, use Monday instead"

3. Key Documentation Findings:
   - The docstring explicitly mentions only Saturday and Sunday behavior
   - No mention of what happens for weekdays (Monday-Friday)
   - The docstring specifically refers to "holiday" context, not general date manipulation
   - No parameter or return value documentation

4. Related Functions in the Module:
   - weekend_to_monday: "If holiday falls on Sunday or Saturday, use day thereafter (Monday) instead"
   - sunday_to_monday: "If holiday falls on Sunday, use day thereafter (Monday) instead"
   - nearest_workday: "If holiday falls on Saturday, use day before (Friday) instead; if holiday falls on Sunday, use day thereafter (Monday) instead"
   - next_workday: "returns next weekday used for observances"
   - These related functions have clearer, more specific names

5. Usage Context:
   - The function is part of the holiday observance system in pandas
   - It's designed to be used as an 'observance' parameter in Holiday objects
   - The purpose is to shift weekend holidays to Monday for business observance rules
   - This is a common business rule where holidays falling on weekends are observed on Monday

6. Documentation Gaps:
   - No explicit statement about weekday behavior (returns unchanged)
   - No parameter type documentation
   - No return value documentation
   - No examples provided
   - Function name doesn't clearly indicate it's for holiday observance specifically

7. Naming vs. Functionality:
   - The name "next_monday" is generic and suggests finding the next Monday from any date
   - The actual functionality is specific to holiday observance rules
   - Similar functions like "weekend_to_monday" have more descriptive names that better match their behavior
