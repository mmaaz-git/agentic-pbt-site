# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation
The `_cum_func` function in masked_accumulations.py has a docstring that states:
"We will modify values in place to replace NAs with the appropriate fill value."

This docstring is ambiguous. It could mean:
1. We internally modify a working copy of values as part of the algorithm
2. We modify the input array that was passed in

The phrase "in place" typically implies modifying the original data structure rather than creating a new one.

## API Conventions in Pandas/NumPy
1. **NumPy conventions**: Most NumPy functions (including np.cumsum) do NOT modify their inputs unless they have an explicit `out` parameter or are methods with names like `sort()` vs `sorted()`.

2. **Pandas conventions**: Functions that modify data in-place typically:
   - Have an `inplace` parameter (like df.drop(inplace=True))
   - Have `_inplace` in their name
   - Are clearly documented as mutating operations

3. **The actual numpy.cumsum behavior**: numpy.cumsum returns a new array and does not modify the input.

## Usage Context
The masked_accumulations functions are used internally by pandas' MaskedArray classes (IntegerArray, BooleanArray, etc.). When called through the `_accumulate` method:
- They pass `self._data` (the internal data array) directly
- The mutation affects the internal state of the MaskedArray object
- This breaks the immutability expectation - after calling cumsum(), the original MaskedArray has corrupted internal data

## Documentation vs Implementation
The documentation says "We will modify values in place" but:
1. This is only mentioned in the internal `_cum_func` docstring, not in the public-facing functions
2. The modification happens BEFORE the accumulation, not as the result
3. The function returns a new array from the numpy function call, but the input was already mutated
4. This violates the principle of least surprise and standard pandas/numpy conventions

## Conclusion
While the docstring does mention "modify values in place", this appears to describe an internal implementation detail rather than an intended API contract. The fact that:
- It corrupts the internal state of MaskedArray objects
- It differs from standard numpy/pandas conventions
- The mutation happens as a side effect before the main operation
- There's no way to prevent this mutation (no copy parameter)

All suggest this is a bug rather than intended behavior.
