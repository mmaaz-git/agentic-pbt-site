## Documentation Analysis for SparseArray.density

### Official Documentation Found

1. **Property Definition** (from source code docstring):
   - "The percent of non- ``fill_value`` points, as decimal."
   - Returns type: `float`
   - Example provided shows normal usage with non-empty array

2. **pandas Documentation** (from web search):
   - Describes density as "Ratio of non-sparse points to total (dense) data points"
   - Shows it returns a decimal representing proportion of non-fill values
   - Examples all use non-empty arrays
   - No mention of behavior for empty arrays

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No specification for empty arrays**:
   - Documentation does not state what should happen when array is empty
   - No examples show empty array usage
   - No warnings about potential division by zero

2. **No error handling documentation**:
   - Does not mention that ZeroDivisionError can occur
   - Does not specify whether NaN, 0.0, or an exception is expected for edge cases

3. **Mathematical ambiguity**:
   - The formula "percent of non-fill_value points" becomes 0/0 for empty arrays
   - This is mathematically undefined, but documentation doesn't address this

### Documentation Completeness Assessment

The documentation is **INCOMPLETE** regarding edge cases:
- It only covers the happy path (non-empty arrays)
- Does not specify behavior for boundary conditions
- Users have no guidance on what to expect with empty arrays
- The type annotation claims `float` return but doesn't account for exceptions

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly define the expected behavior for empty arrays. This makes the bug report's claim that "The docstring for density provides no guidance on empty array behavior" accurate. Since the behavior is unspecified, there are multiple reasonable implementations:
1. Return 0.0 (as suggested in bug report)
2. Return NaN (mathematically representing undefined)
3. Raise an exception (current behavior, though unintentional)

The lack of specification means this is not clearly "incorrect" behavior according to documentation, but it is certainly undesirable and unexpected behavior that should be addressed.
