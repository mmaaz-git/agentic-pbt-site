## Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The function's docstring clearly states it should "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- When indexing with an empty range, Python returns an empty array (length 0), not a negative-length array
- The behavior contradicts Python's standard `len(range())` semantics
- The test case is straightforward and uses normal, valid inputs (positive integers)

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- None. The bug report correctly identifies incorrect behavior that violates the documented contract.

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty ranges are common in programming
- The bug could cause real issues in code that relies on length calculations
- Negative lengths are semantically meaningless and could cause downstream errors
- The fix is simple and straightforward

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- The function is internal (in `utils` module), not public API
- *However*, it's still used internally by pandas and incorrect behavior could affect other parts

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could argue the documentation should specify behavior for empty ranges
- *However*, the documentation already says "expected length of target[indexer]" which has clear semantics

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation, while brief, is correct - it's the implementation that's wrong
- Changing documentation to say "returns negative values for empty ranges" would be nonsensical
- The natural interpretation of "length" never includes negative values

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that handling empty ranges properly is a "new feature"

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature
- The function already handles ranges, just incorrectly
- Returning correct lengths for all inputs is core functionality, not an enhancement

### Considering BUG
**Strong arguments for BUG:**
1. The function returns incorrect values that contradict its documented purpose
2. The behavior violates Python's standard semantics for range objects
3. Negative lengths are semantically meaningless and incorrect
4. The function works correctly for non-empty ranges but fails for empty ones
5. The issue is in the implementation logic, not the specification
6. Easy to reproduce with simple, valid inputs
7. Has a clear, correct expected behavior (return 0 for empty ranges)
8. The proposed fix is straightforward and logical

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has a simple logical error in its range handling that causes it to return negative values when it should return 0. This violates both its documented contract and Python's standard semantics for range objects.
