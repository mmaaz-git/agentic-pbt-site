## Documentation Analysis

### Official pandas Documentation

#### to_json() Method
The documentation states that `orient='split'` produces a dictionary format:
- Format: `{'index' -> [index], 'columns' -> [columns], 'data' -> [values]}`
- The index is preserved when using 'split' orientation
- The documentation mentions "round-trip conversion" capability between DataFrames and JSON

#### read_json() Method
The documentation indicates:
- `orient='split'` format allows round-trip conversion with `to_json(orient='split')`
- "Preserves original DataFrame structure"
- By default, it infers data types

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No explicit guarantee about index type preservation**: The documentation does not specifically state that index *types* (e.g., RangeIndex vs Index) will be preserved during round-trip operations.

2. **No mention of empty DataFrame behavior**: The documentation doesn't address special cases with empty DataFrames and how their indexes are handled.

3. **Ambiguous round-trip claims**: While the documentation mentions "round-trip conversion" and "preserves original DataFrame structure", it doesn't clearly define what aspects of the structure are guaranteed to be preserved (values only, dtypes, index types, etc.).

### Related Issues in pandas GitHub

1. **Issue #21287**: Empty DataFrames with `orient='table'` had round-trip issues (fixed)

2. **Issue #28558**: `read_json` with `convert_axes=True` produces different index types for empty frames - developers acknowledged this as an edge case

3. **Issue #22525**: General round-trip JSON serialization issues acknowledged by the pandas team

### Documentation Interpretation

The documentation's claim about "preserving original DataFrame structure" and enabling "round-trip conversion" could reasonably be interpreted to mean that index types should be preserved. However:

1. The documentation never explicitly guarantees index type preservation
2. The `convert_axes` parameter (default True for 'split') attempts to convert axes to "proper dtypes" - suggesting type conversion is expected behavior
3. There's no specification about what constitutes a "proper dtype" for an empty index

### Conclusion

The documentation is ambiguous about whether index type preservation is guaranteed. While it mentions round-trip capability, it doesn't specify that all metadata (including exact index types) will be preserved. This leaves room for interpretation about whether the current behavior is a bug or working as designed.
