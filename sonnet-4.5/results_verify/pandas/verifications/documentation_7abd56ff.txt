## Documentation Analysis for pandas.io.formats.printing._justify

### Function Documentation Review

**Docstring Analysis:**
```python
"""
Justify items in head and tail, so they are right-aligned when stacked.

Parameters
----------
head : list-like of list-likes of strings
tail : list-like of list-likes of strings

Returns
-------
tuple of list of tuples of strings
    Same as head and tail, but items are right aligned when stacked
    vertically.

Examples
--------
>>> _justify([['a', 'b']], [['abc', 'abcd']])
([('  a', '   b')], [('abc', 'abcd')])
"""
```

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **No Length Requirement Stated**: The documentation does NOT specify that all inner sequences must have the same length. It simply states "list-like of list-likes of strings" for both parameters.

2. **Return Value Description**: The documentation promises to return "Same as head and tail, but items are right aligned" - this implies the function should preserve content and only add alignment padding.

3. **Example Limitation**: The single example provided only shows sequences of equal length ([['a', 'b']] and [['abc', 'abcd']] both have 2 elements), which doesn't clarify behavior for unequal lengths.

4. **Function Name Semantics**: The function is named "_justify" which in text formatting contexts typically means adjusting spacing/padding, not removing content.

5. **Internal Function Status**: The leading underscore indicates this is an internal/private function, but it is still imported and used by other pandas components.

### Documentation Gaps:

1. The documentation does not warn about data loss when sequences have different lengths
2. The documentation does not specify that all sequences must have the same length
3. The return value description "Same as head and tail" is misleading if data is dropped

### Conclusion:

Based on the documentation analysis, the current behavior (silently dropping data) is **NOT documented** and contradicts the reasonable expectation from both:
- The function name ("justify" implies formatting, not data removal)
- The return description ("Same as head and tail" implies content preservation)

This is not a case of unclear documentation but rather behavior that contradicts what the documentation implies the function should do.
