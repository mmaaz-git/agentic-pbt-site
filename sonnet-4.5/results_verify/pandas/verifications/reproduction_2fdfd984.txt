## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Direct Reproduction
The bug occurs exactly as described when calling:
```python
pd_common.dedup_names(['0', '0'], is_potential_multiindex=True)
```
This raises an AssertionError at line 1258 of pandas/io/common.py.

### Key Observations:

1. **The bug only occurs with duplicates**: When I tested `['0', '1', '2']` (no duplicates) with `is_potential_multiindex=True`, it worked fine and returned the same list unchanged.

2. **Works correctly with is_potential_multiindex=False**: The same input `['0', '0']` with `is_potential_multiindex=False` correctly returns `['0', '0.1']`.

3. **Works correctly with tuples**: When using tuples `[('a',), ('a',)]` with `is_potential_multiindex=True`, it correctly returns `[('a',), ('a.1',)]`.

4. **The assertion is only reached when deduplication is needed**: The code path containing `assert isinstance(col, tuple)` at line 1258 is only executed when there are duplicate names that need to be renamed (inside the `while cur_count > 0` loop).

### Root Cause:
The function has a type signature accepting `Sequence[Hashable]` but contains an assertion that requires tuples when `is_potential_multiindex=True` AND duplicates exist. This assertion (line 1258) has a comment "# for mypy" suggesting it was meant for static type checking, but it actually causes a runtime crash.

The bug report is accurate in its description of the problem and the failing test case correctly identifies the issue.
