## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The code is working as intended based on the GitHub issue #34457. The current behavior where astype(np.float64) returns a dense array appears to be a deliberate design decision made by the pandas developers. The issue discussion shows there was debate about whether astype should preserve sparseness, and the final implementation chose to convert to dense arrays when given a non-SparseDtype. The bug reporter is misunderstanding the intended behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly and unambiguously states "The output will always be a SparseArray" without any qualifications or exceptions. This is a clear contract that the implementation violates. Users reading the documentation would have every right to expect a SparseArray to be returned in all cases.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This behavior has been in place since at least pandas 1.5 (based on GH#34457), and changing it now would be a breaking API change. Many users may already depend on the current behavior where astype with a numpy dtype returns a dense array. The workaround is simple - just wrap the dtype in SparseDtype. The distinction between numpy dtypes and SparseDtype provides users with control over whether they want sparse or dense output.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it's a fundamental violation of the documented API contract. The documentation promises one behavior but delivers another. This could cause real bugs in production code where developers rely on the documented behavior. The fact that there's a workaround doesn't excuse the documentation being wrong.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The actual implementation appears to be the intended behavior based on GH#34457. The documentation is simply wrong or outdated. The fix would be to update the documentation to accurately describe the actual behavior: "When given a SparseDtype, returns a SparseArray. When given a regular numpy dtype, returns a dense ndarray." This would align the documentation with the implementation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is very explicit and intentional in its wording. It even contrasts astype with numpy.asarray, saying that numpy.asarray should be used to get a dense array. This suggests the documentation accurately reflects the original design intent, and it's the implementation that diverged from the specification.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for new behavior - to have astype always preserve sparseness regardless of the dtype provided. This could be implemented as a new feature with an optional parameter like astype(dtype, preserve_sparse=True) to give users control over the behavior. This would be adding functionality that doesn't currently exist in the intended design.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't a request for new functionality - it's pointing out that the existing functionality doesn't match its documentation. The documentation already promises this behavior, so it's not a new feature but rather a bug that the promised behavior isn't implemented.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation unequivocally states "The output will always be a SparseArray" and explicitly tells users to use numpy.asarray if they want a dense array. The implementation directly contradicts this documented contract. This is a textbook case of a bug where the implementation doesn't match the specification. Users relying on the documentation would encounter unexpected runtime errors.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The behavior appears to be intentional based on GH#34457. The pandas team made a deliberate decision about how astype should work with different dtype types. The comment "# GH#34457" in the code shows this was not an oversight but a conscious implementation choice. The documentation may simply be outdated or incorrect.

**Overall consideration**
After careful analysis, this appears to be a clear case where the documentation and implementation disagree. The documentation explicitly promises "The output will always be a SparseArray" but the implementation returns a dense ndarray when given a numpy dtype directly. The presence of GH#34457 comment in the code suggests this behavior was intentional, added to address some specific use case or design consideration.

The key question is whether the documentation or the implementation represents the correct behavior. Given that the implementation has been this way since at least pandas 1.5 (based on the GH#34457 timeline), and no deprecation warning is raised in pandas 2.3.2, it seems the pandas team has accepted this behavior as correct. The documentation appears to be outdated or incorrectly written.

While technically this could be considered a bug (implementation doesn't match documentation), the more pragmatic classification is DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The implementation represents the intended behavior that has been in production for multiple versions, and changing it now would be a breaking change. The documentation should be updated to accurately describe the actual behavior: that astype returns a SparseArray when given a SparseDtype, but returns a dense array when given a regular numpy dtype.
