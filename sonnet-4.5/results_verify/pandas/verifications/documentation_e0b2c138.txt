## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `length_of_indexer` function in `pandas.core.indexers.utils` has the following documentation:

```python
def length_of_indexer(indexer, target=None) -> int:
    """
    Return the expected length of target[indexer]

    Returns
    -------
    int
    """
```

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **Return Value Specification**: The docstring states the function returns "the expected length of target[indexer]" as an `int`. It does NOT explicitly state that the value must be non-negative.

2. **Semantic Meaning**: However, the phrase "expected length" has a clear semantic meaning in Python. The `len()` function, which is the standard way to get the length of any sequence in Python, always returns non-negative integers. This is a fundamental invariant in Python.

3. **Usage Context**: The function is used internally in pandas for:
   - Validation in `check_setitem_lengths` (line 175 of utils.py) where it's compared against `len(value)`
   - Calculating plane indexer lengths in `core/indexing.py`

   In both cases, negative values would be semantically incorrect.

4. **Python's Slice Behavior**: When Python evaluates `target[slice(start, stop, step)]`:
   - It always returns a valid sequence (possibly empty)
   - `len()` of that sequence is always >= 0
   - This is true even for "impossible" slices like `slice(1, 0, 1)`

5. **No Documentation of Edge Cases**: The documentation doesn't specify behavior for:
   - Empty slices (should return 0)
   - Out-of-bounds indices
   - Negative step values
   - Invalid slice combinations

6. **Public vs Internal API**: While the function is in `pandas.core.indexers` (marked as internal/private API), it's still expected to follow Python's semantic conventions for what "length" means.

### Conclusion
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state "returns non-negative integers", the semantic meaning of "length" in Python universally implies non-negative values. The function name `length_of_indexer` and its docstring "Return the expected length of target[indexer]" create a clear expectation that it should behave like `len(target[indexer])`, which never returns negative values.
