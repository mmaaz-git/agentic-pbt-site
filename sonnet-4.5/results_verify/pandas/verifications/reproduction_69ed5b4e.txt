REPRODUCTION REPORT
==================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in the pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError.__init__ method.

## Test Execution

1. **Simple Reproduction Test**:
   - Ran the provided reproduction code that attempts to create an AbstractMethodError with invalid methodtype "invalid"
   - Confirmed the actual error message: "methodtype must be one of invalid, got {'staticmethod', 'classmethod', 'method', 'property'} instead."
   - This is backwards - it says "must be one of invalid" which is nonsensical

2. **Property-Based Test**:
   - Validated the test logic - it correctly checks that valid method types should not appear in the "got X" part of the error message
   - The test fails because all valid types ('method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', 'property') appear in the "got" part instead of the "must be one of" part

3. **Source Code Verification**:
   - Located the bug in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/errors/__init__.py at line 298
   - Confirmed the f-string has swapped variables: f"methodtype must be one of {methodtype}, got {types} instead."
   - The correct format should be: f"methodtype must be one of {types}, got {methodtype} instead."

4. **Valid Values Test**:
   - Confirmed that 'method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', and 'property' are the four valid values
   - Verified that these values work correctly and produce appropriate error messages when used properly

## Effect of the Bug

The bug causes a confusing error message when an invalid methodtype is provided. Instead of clearly stating what values are allowed and what was provided, it produces a backwards message that says "must be one of [the invalid value]" which makes no sense to users trying to debug their code.

This is a clear case of swapped variables in the error message formatting string.
