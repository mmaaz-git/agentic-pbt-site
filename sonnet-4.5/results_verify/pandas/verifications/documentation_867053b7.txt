# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation
The `convert_to_line_delimits` function has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Helper function that converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON."
- Code comment: "Determine we have a JSON list to turn to lines otherwise just return the json object, only lists can"

## Key Documentation Points

### 1. Function Purpose
According to the docstring and comments, the function should:
- Convert JSON lists (arrays) to line-delimited JSON format
- Return non-list JSON objects unchanged
- Only process strings that represent JSON arrays (start with '[' and end with ']')

### 2. Internal Function Status
- This is an internal helper function in `pandas/io/json/_normalize.py`
- Not part of the public API (no public documentation exists)
- Used internally by pandas' JSON export functionality when `lines=True` is specified

### 3. Usage Context
The function is called from `pandas.io.json._json.py` when writing JSON with `lines=True`:
```python
if lines:
    s = convert_to_line_delimits(s)
```

### 4. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation
The documentation clearly states:
1. JSON lists should be converted to line-delimited format
2. Non-list JSON should be returned unchanged
3. The determination of whether input is a list is based on checking for '[' at start and ']' at end

### 5. No Tests Found
- No unit tests were found specifically for this function
- This is concerning for a function with a logic bug

## Documentation Verdict
The documentation, while minimal, is clear about the intended behavior:
- JSON arrays (strings starting with '[' and ending with ']') should be converted
- All other JSON strings should be returned unchanged

The current implementation violates this documented behavior due to the operator precedence bug. The function incorrectly modifies non-array JSON strings instead of returning them unchanged as documented.
