## Documentation Analysis

### Official pandas Documentation
The pandas documentation for `autocorrelation_plot` (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.plotting.autocorrelation_plot.html) provides:
- Basic function description: "Creates an autocorrelation plot for a time series"
- Parameter descriptions for `series` and `ax`
- Example usage with a series containing random and sinusoidal components
- **NO mention of behavior with constant series or zero variance data**
- **NO warnings about edge cases or undefined behavior**

### Mathematical Definition of Autocorrelation
According to mathematical sources (Wikipedia and statistical references):

1. **Standard Formula**:
   - Autocorrelation coefficient: ρ(k) = Cov(Xt, Xt-k) / [σ(Xt) · σ(Xt-k)]
   - Alternative: ρ(k) = γ(k)/γ(0), where γ(0) is the variance

2. **Known Mathematical Edge Case**:
   - Wikipedia explicitly states: "the variance may be zero (for a constant process)"
   - This makes the autocorrelation **mathematically undefined**
   - Division by zero is a fundamental mathematical issue, not an implementation detail

3. **Expected Behavior in Statistics**:
   - Autocorrelation is undefined for constant series (zero variance)
   - This is a well-known limitation in time series analysis
   - Standard statistical packages typically handle this as a special case

### Documentation Gap
The pandas documentation does not:
1. Warn users about constant series behavior
2. Specify how the function handles zero variance input
3. Document the RuntimeWarning that occurs
4. Explain that NaN values will be produced for constant series

### Conclusion
There is a clear documentation gap. While the mathematical undefinedness of autocorrelation for constant series is well-established in statistics, the pandas documentation fails to mention this important edge case. Users would reasonably expect either:
1. A clear, informative error message
2. Documentation warning about this limitation
3. Graceful handling of the edge case

The current behavior (RuntimeWarning with NaN results) is neither documented nor user-friendly.
