## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Test Results:

1. **Manual Reproduction Test**:
   - When running the provided reproduction code with an instance passed for `methodtype="classmethod"`:
   - Result: Crashed with `AttributeError: 'SampleClass' object has no attribute '__name__'`
   - This matches exactly what the bug report claimed would happen.

2. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The hypothesis test runs successfully and passes, confirming that the AttributeError is raised as expected.
   - The test validates that when `methodtype="classmethod"` and an instance is provided, str(error) crashes.

3. **Correct Usage Test**:
   - When passing a class (not an instance) with `methodtype="classmethod"`:
   - Result: Works correctly, produces: "This classmethod must be defined in the concrete class SampleClass"
   - This confirms the issue only occurs when an instance is incorrectly passed instead of a class.

### Code Analysis:

The bug occurs in the `__str__` method at line 305 of `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/errors/__init__.py`:

```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    if self.methodtype == "classmethod":
        name = self.class_instance.__name__  # Line 305 - assumes class_instance is a class
    else:
        name = type(self.class_instance).__name__  # Line 307 - works for instances
```

When `methodtype="classmethod"`, the code assumes `class_instance` has a `__name__` attribute, which is only true for classes, not instances. This causes the AttributeError when an instance is passed.

### Conclusion:

The bug is real and reproducible. The error occurs exactly as described in the bug report when a user passes an instance instead of a class with `methodtype="classmethod"`.
