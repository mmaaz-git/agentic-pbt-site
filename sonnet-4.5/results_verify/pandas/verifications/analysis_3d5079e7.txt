## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if the pandas team intentionally designed these validation defaults to include extra parameters for future compatibility or internal processing reasons, even if numpy doesn't have them. Perhaps pandas internally uses dtype for median or initial for mean in ways not directly mapped to numpy.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The module's own documentation explicitly states its purpose is to validate that parameters "correspond ONLY to those in the numpy signature." The code confirms that MEDIAN_DEFAULTS includes 'dtype' when numpy.median doesn't have it, MEAN_DEFAULTS includes 'initial' when numpy.mean doesn't have it, and MINMAX_DEFAULTS includes 'dtype' when numpy.min/max don't have it. This directly contradicts the stated contract.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered WONTFIX if the current behavior has been in place for a long time and changing it might break existing code that incorrectly passes these parameters with None values. The impact is relatively minor since passing None doesn't affect the computation results.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug involves validation code whose entire purpose is to ensure correct parameter passing. Having incorrect validation defeats the purpose of validation. The fix is straightforward and would make the code match its documented intent.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the pandas team actually intends to accept these extra parameters for some reason, then the module documentation should be updated to explain why validation includes parameters not in numpy's signature.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The module documentation is clear about its purpose - to validate against numpy signatures. The code is what's wrong, not the documentation. The validation defaults simply contain incorrect entries that should be removed.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue this is a request to add stricter validation that properly rejects unexpected parameters, which could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality. The validation system already exists and has a clear stated purpose. This is about fixing existing validation to work correctly according to its documented contract.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The validation defaults objectively contain parameters that don't exist in the corresponding numpy functions. The module's stated purpose is to validate parameters against numpy signatures. The current behavior directly contradicts this purpose by accepting parameters numpy doesn't have. The tests demonstrate the mismatch, and the fix is clear and straightforward.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if there's some undocumented intentional reason for including these extra parameters, but there's no evidence of this in the code or documentation.

**Overall consideration**
This appears to be a valid bug. The pandas.compat.numpy.function module has a clearly stated purpose: to validate that extra parameters passed to pandas functions correspond only to those in numpy signatures. The hypothesis tests correctly identify that MEDIAN_DEFAULTS includes 'dtype' which numpy.median doesn't have, MEAN_DEFAULTS includes 'initial' which numpy.mean doesn't have, and MINMAX_DEFAULTS includes 'dtype' which numpy.min/max don't have.

The reproduction confirms that pandas silently accepts these invalid parameters when passed as None, and raises ValueError (not TypeError) when passed with non-None values. This violates the module's contract and provides incorrect error handling. The bug report provides a clear fix that removes the incorrect parameters from the validation defaults.

While this is a low-severity issue that likely doesn't affect many users, it's still a legitimate bug in validation logic that should be fixed to maintain code correctness and consistency with the module's stated purpose. The fix is simple and unlikely to break existing code since it would only affect code that's already passing invalid parameters.
