## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states that with sort=False, groups will "appear in the same order as they did in the original DataFrame." The current behavior follows this literally - observed categories appear in their DataFrame order first, followed by unobserved categories. The documentation doesn't promise that categorical ordering will be maintained with sort=False, and actually says "specifying sort=False with an ordered categorical grouper will no longer sort the values." This could be interpreted as meaning the categorical order is intentionally not maintained.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report accurately describes actual behavior that contradicts reasonable expectations. When using an ordered categorical with observed=False, users would expect the categorical's inherent order to be respected, especially since the documentation emphasizes that ordered categoricals have "meaningful" order. The current behavior creates an inconsistent hybrid ordering that doesn't match either pure categorical order or pure appearance order.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case involving a specific combination of parameters (ordered categorical + observed=False + sort=False). Most users either want sorted results (sort=True, the default) or only observed values (observed=True, also default). The performance benefit of sort=False might justify the current behavior, and changing it could break existing code that depends on this ordering. The workaround is simple: use sort=True when categorical order matters.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This isn't a trivial issue - it affects fundamental data ordering behavior that users rely on for correctness. Categorical data types exist specifically to define custom orderings, and having that order ignored in certain parameter combinations undermines the purpose of ordered categoricals. The inconsistency between sort=True and sort=False behavior is confusing and could lead to subtle bugs in user code.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is genuinely ambiguous about this interaction. It doesn't explicitly state what happens when combining sort=False with observed=False for categoricals. If the current behavior is intentional, the documentation should clearly explain that sort=False with observed=False will place observed categories first in appearance order, followed by unobserved categories. This would help users understand and work with the actual behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The fundamental issue isn't just unclear documentation - it's that the behavior itself seems inconsistent with the concept of ordered categoricals. Simply documenting the current behavior doesn't address the underlying design problem where categorical ordering can be unexpectedly ignored. Users creating ordered categoricals have explicitly defined an order they want respected.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for new behavior - that sort=False should still respect categorical ordering when observed=False. This could be viewed as a request for enhancement rather than a bug fix. The current behavior might be working as originally designed, and the user wants it to work differently. Adding a new parameter or option to control this behavior could be a feature addition.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but rather for existing functionality to work consistently. Ordered categoricals already exist and are supposed to define ordering. The groupby operation with observed=False already promises to include all categories. The expectation that these features work together coherently isn't a new feature request but a reasonable assumption about how existing features should interact.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
When you explicitly create an ordered categorical, you're defining the canonical order for those values. Having that order ignored in certain parameter combinations violates the principle of least surprise and the fundamental contract of ordered categoricals. The behavior is internally inconsistent - sort=True respects categorical order but sort=False doesn't, even though sort should primarily affect performance, not fundamental ordering semantics. The documentation emphasizes that ordered categoricals have meaningful order that should be respected in operations.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation does state that sort=False means groups appear in DataFrame order and "will no longer sort the values" for ordered categoricals. This could be interpreted as intentionally not using categorical ordering. The current behavior is deterministic and consistent within its own logic (observed first, then unobserved). Since the documentation doesn't explicitly promise categorical order will be maintained with sort=False, this might be working as designed.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be primarily a DOCUMENTATION_FIX issue, though there are arguments for other categorizations. The core problem is that the pandas documentation doesn't clearly specify what should happen when combining sort=False with observed=False for categorical groupers.

The current behavior, while perhaps unexpected, follows a consistent internal logic: with sort=False, observed groups appear in their DataFrame appearance order (as documented), and unobserved categories are appended afterward. This isn't necessarily "wrong" - it's just different from what users might expect given that they've defined an ordered categorical. The documentation's statement that sort=False with ordered categoricals "will no longer sort the values" could be interpreted as supporting the current behavior.

However, the lack of clear documentation about this specific interaction creates confusion. Users reasonably expect that ordered categoricals would maintain their defined order, especially with observed=False which promises to show all categories. The best resolution would be to clearly document the current behavior, explaining that sort=False prioritizes appearance order over categorical order, even for ordered categoricals. This would help users understand when to use sort=True (to respect categorical order) versus sort=False (for performance when order doesn't matter or when appearance order is preferred).
