BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

## Reproduction Summary
I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug occurs exactly as described when TimeFormatter attempts to format time values with fractional seconds that round to exactly 1000000 microseconds.

## Test Results

### Hypothesis Test
- The property-based test from the bug report fails when run with hypothesis
- The test crashes with "ValueError: microsecond must be in 0..999999"
- This confirms the test can generate inputs that trigger the bug

### Manual Reproduction
Test input: x = 86400.99999999997

Computation breakdown:
- int(x) = 86400
- (x - int(x)) * 10^6 = 999999.9999708962
- round((x - int(x)) * 10^6) = 1000000 (exceeds valid range!)

Result: ValueError: microsecond must be in 0..999999

## Code Analysis
Looking at the source code in converter.py (lines 210-225), the bug occurs at:
1. Line 212: `msus = round((x - s) * 10**6)` - this rounds to 1000000
2. Lines 219, 221: `pydt.time(h, m, s, msus)` - this fails because datetime.time requires microseconds to be in range [0, 999999]

The issue is that when the fractional part is very close to 1.0, rounding can produce exactly 1000000 microseconds, which is equivalent to 1 second but exceeds the valid microsecond range for datetime.time().

## Verification of Bug Report Claims
✓ The bug occurs exactly as described
✓ The root cause analysis in the report is correct
✓ The failing input (86400.99999999997) triggers the bug
✓ The error message matches ("microsecond must be in 0..999999")

The bug is real and reproducible.
