BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

## Successfully Reproduced

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the Hypothesis test and the direct example confirm the issue.

## Test Results

### Direct Example
Input: values=[2.2250738585e-313, -1.0], bins=2
Result: ValueError: missing values must be missing in the same location both left and right sides

The error occurs exactly as described in the bug report. The traceback confirms it originates from:
- pandas/core/arrays/interval.py:664 in the _validate method

### Key Observations

1. The input values are valid Python floats:
   - 2.2250738585e-313 (a denormal/subnormal float)
   - -1.0 (a normal float)

2. The value 2.2250738585e-313 is indeed a denormal float:
   - It's smaller than the smallest normal float64 (2.2250738585072014e-308)
   - It's a valid IEEE 754 floating-point number

3. The error message is misleading:
   - It complains about "missing values" when there are no missing values in the input
   - The actual issue appears to be related to numerical precision during bin edge calculation

4. Runtime warnings about "invalid value encountered in divide":
   - Multiple warnings suggest that NaN values are being generated during calculations
   - This likely happens when computing bin edges with the extreme range difference

5. The range calculation works in numpy:
   - Min: -1.0, Max: 2.2250738585e-313
   - Range: 1.0 (approximately, due to the denormal being so close to 0)

## Confirmation

The bug report is accurate in its description:
- The code does crash with the specified input
- The error message is indeed misleading (talks about missing values when none exist)
- The issue is related to handling denormal floats in combination with normal floats

The bug manifests as described and represents a genuine issue where valid numeric input causes an unexpected crash with a confusing error message.
