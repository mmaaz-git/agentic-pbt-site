REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR PyArrow Single-Value CSV Bug

1. Bug Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED
   - The reported behavior is accurate and reproducible
   - PyArrow engine fails to parse single-value CSV files without trailing newlines
   - Both C and Python engines successfully parse the same input

2. Test Results Summary:

   Single value "0" (no trailing newline):
   - C engine: ✓ Successfully parses to DataFrame with shape (1, 1), value=0
   - Python engine: ✓ Successfully parses to DataFrame with shape (1, 1), value=0
   - PyArrow engine: ✗ Raises ParserError: "CSV parse error: Empty CSV file or block: cannot infer number of columns"

   Other single values tested (all without trailing newlines):
   - "42": C ✓, Python ✓, PyArrow ✗
   - "hello": C ✓, Python ✓, PyArrow ✗
   - "3.14": C ✓, Python ✓, PyArrow ✗
   - "-1": C ✓, Python ✓, PyArrow ✗

   Single value "0" WITH trailing newline:
   - C engine: ✓ Successfully parses
   - Python engine: ✓ Successfully parses
   - PyArrow engine: ✓ Successfully parses

3. Key Observations:
   - The issue is specific to CSV content without trailing newlines
   - Adding a newline character makes PyArrow work correctly
   - The error message is misleading - the CSV is not "empty", it contains valid data
   - The C and Python engines handle both cases (with and without trailing newline) correctly

4. Hypothesis Test Results:
   - The hypothesis test fails immediately with data=[[0]]
   - This confirms the engines are NOT equivalent for all valid inputs
   - The test correctly identifies the inconsistency between C and PyArrow engines

5. Technical Details:
   - The error originates from PyArrow's internal CSV parser (pyarrow._csv.read_csv)
   - The error type is pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid
   - It appears PyArrow's CSV parser requires at least one newline to properly parse a file

6. Impact Assessment:
   - This affects any single-line CSV file without a trailing newline
   - The workaround (adding "\n") is simple but not obvious
   - Users migrating from C/Python engines to PyArrow would encounter unexpected failures
