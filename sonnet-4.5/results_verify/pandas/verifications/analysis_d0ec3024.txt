## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Category: BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The function crashes with valid IEEE 754 floating-point numbers (subnormal floats are valid)
- The error message is completely misleading ("missing values" when there are no NaN/missing values)
- The documentation doesn't mention any limitations on value ranges
- The function accepts "1d ndarray" without qualification, implying all valid floats should work
- Subnormal floats are used in real scientific computing scenarios (as noted in the bug report)
- The crash happens in internal validation code, not user-facing input validation

### Category: INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Could argue that extreme dynamic ranges (1e-310 to 3.0) are unrealistic for quantile binning
- However, the function should still handle valid inputs gracefully

**Assessment: UNLIKELY** - The inputs are valid floating-point numbers and the function should handle them.

### Category: WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Subnormal floats (like 1e-310) are extremely rare edge cases
- The dynamic range from 1e-310 to 3.0 spans over 310 orders of magnitude
- Could be considered an obscure numerical precision issue
- Fixing might require significant changes to numerical algorithms

**Assessment: POSSIBLE** - This is an edge case that may not be worth the complexity to fix.

### Category: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that supporting extreme dynamic ranges is a new feature
- However, these are valid floats, not a new data type

**Assessment: UNLIKELY** - The function already claims to support arrays, this isn't requesting new functionality.

### Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to explicitly state limitations with extreme values
- Could document that subnormal floats or extreme dynamic ranges are not supported
- The error message could be improved to be more informative

**Assessment: POSSIBLE** - If the behavior is deemed acceptable, documentation should clarify limitations.

### Final Assessment

This appears to be a **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Valid Input Rejection**: The function rejects valid IEEE 754 floating-point numbers without documentation
2. **Misleading Error**: The error message about "missing values" is incorrect and confusing
3. **Numerical Instability**: The "invalid value encountered in divide" warnings indicate unhandled numerical issues
4. **No Input Validation**: The function doesn't validate input ranges upfront if such limitations exist
5. **Use Case Validity**: Scientific computing does use subnormal floats for probabilities, physical constants, etc.

Even if fixing the numerical algorithm is complex, the function should at minimum:
- Detect extreme dynamic ranges and provide a clear error message
- Document any limitations on input value ranges
- Not crash with a misleading error about "missing values"

The fact that it crashes deep in interval validation code with a confusing error rather than handling the case gracefully or providing clear feedback makes this a legitimate bug rather than just a documentation issue.
