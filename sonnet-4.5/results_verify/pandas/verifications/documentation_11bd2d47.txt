## Documentation Analysis

### 1. Function Docstrings

The functions have clear docstrings in the source code:

**is_subperiod:**
```
Returns True if downsampling is possible between source and target frequencies

Parameters:
- source: str or DateOffset - Frequency converting from
- target: str or DateOffset - Frequency converting to
Returns: bool
```

**is_superperiod:**
```
Returns True if upsampling is possible between source and target frequencies

Parameters:
- source: str or DateOffset - Frequency converting from
- target: str or DateOffset - Frequency converting to
Returns: bool
```

### 2. Semantic Interpretation

Based on the docstrings:
- `is_subperiod(source, target)`: Can we downsample FROM source TO target?
- `is_superperiod(source, target)`: Can we upsample FROM source TO target?

The mathematical relationship should be:
- If you can downsample from A to B, then you can upsample from B to A
- Therefore: `is_subperiod(A, B) == is_superperiod(B, A)`

### 3. Public vs Internal API Status

These functions are NOT part of the public pandas API:
- They are located in `pandas.tseries.frequencies` but not documented in the public API reference
- They are actually implemented in `pandas._libs.tslibs.frequencies` (internal module)
- They are primarily used internally by pandas for resampling operations
- The functions are accessed internally by `resample()` and time series plotting functionality

### 4. Related Issues

GitHub Issue #18553 documents inconsistent behavior where `is_subperiod('M', 'M')` returns False while `is_subperiod('D', 'D')` returns True. A pandas developer commented that "for that internal usage, the method should not return True for equal freqs" - suggesting these functions have specific internal semantics that may not match intuitive expectations.

### 5. Usage Context

In `pandas/core/resample.py`, these functions determine resampling direction:
- If `is_subperiod(ax.freq, self.freq)`: perform downsampling
- If `is_superperiod(ax.freq, self.freq)`: perform upsampling

### 6. Documentation Gaps

1. These functions are not in the public API documentation
2. The inverse relationship expectation is not explicitly documented
3. The specific semantics for business day frequencies (B, C) vs calendar days (D) are not explained
4. The functions' behavior suggests they may be checking "strict" sub/super periods rather than general convertibility

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly state that these functions should maintain an inverse relationship. However, the natural interpretation of "downsampling" and "upsampling" strongly suggests they should be inverses of each other. The fact that these are internal functions complicates the issue - they may have been designed with specific internal use cases in mind rather than as general-purpose frequency comparison functions.
