## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior is actually documented in pandas.read_csv, which explicitly states that "separators longer than 1 character and different from '\s+' will be interpreted as regular expressions." The function is working exactly as documented - multi-character separators ARE supposed to be treated as regex patterns. Users who want literal multi-character separators need to escape them, which is standard regex behavior. The errors occur because invalid regex patterns are being passed, which is expected behavior when passing malformed regex.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation for read_clipboard itself doesn't mention this critical behavior, requiring users to follow the reference to read_csv to understand it. The error messages are confusing low-level regex errors rather than helpful pandas errors. Many users would reasonably expect '**' to be treated as a literal string separator, not a regex pattern, especially since single-character '*' works fine as a literal.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case involving unusual separators like '**' or '++' that are rarely used in practice. The workaround (using re.escape()) is straightforward for users who understand regex. The behavior is technically correct according to the underlying design where multi-character separators are treated as regex. Changing this would be a breaking change for existing code that relies on regex separators.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The confusion and poor error messages affect user experience significantly. Common separators like '**' (used in markdown tables) or '::' (used in various formats) are not that obscure. The issue causes crashes rather than graceful handling, which is poor UX. The fix would be simple - either better error messages or auto-escaping with a warning.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The core issue is that read_clipboard's documentation doesn't explain that multi-character separators are treated as regex. The behavior itself is reasonable and documented in read_csv, but users of read_clipboard don't see this information. Adding a note to the docstring about regex behavior and how to use re.escape() for literal separators would resolve the confusion without changing any functionality.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The crash with unhelpful error messages is still a problem even with better documentation. Users shouldn't need to understand regex internals to use common separators. The error experience is poor regardless of documentation. Simply documenting the current behavior doesn't address the fundamental UX problem.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The report is essentially asking for better handling of multi-character literal separators, which isn't currently supported without manual escaping. Adding auto-detection and escaping of invalid regex patterns would be a new feature. The request for better error messages could be seen as an enhancement rather than a bug fix. This would improve usability without breaking existing functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current behavior causes crashes with confusing errors, which is more of a bug than a missing feature. Users aren't asking for new functionality - they expect existing functionality (multi-char separators) to work without cryptic errors. The issue is with error handling and user experience, not missing capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with confusing low-level regex errors instead of providing helpful error messages. The UX is objectively poor - users get "PatternError: nothing to repeat at position 0" instead of guidance on how to fix their separator. The inconsistency where '||' appears to work but actually produces wrong results is misleading. The documentation gap between read_clipboard and read_csv creates confusion about expected behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function is working exactly as designed and documented (in read_csv). Invalid regex patterns are supposed to cause errors. The behavior is consistent - all multi-character separators are treated as regex, and invalid regex fails. This is standard behavior in many text processing tools. Users who understand regex would expect this behavior.

## Overall consideration
The fundamental issue here is a disconnect between user expectations and implementation reality. While the behavior IS technically documented in read_csv, most users would not expect literal strings like '**' to be interpreted as regex patterns, especially when single-character '*' works fine as a literal. The error messages are particularly problematic - getting "PatternError: nothing to repeat" when trying to use '**' as a separator is confusing and unhelpful.

However, this is primarily a documentation and error messaging issue rather than incorrect functionality. The code is working as designed - multi-character separators are intentionally treated as regex patterns to enable powerful pattern matching. The solution should focus on improving documentation and error messages rather than changing the core behavior, which would be a breaking change.

Given that the behavior is documented (albeit not prominently) and the code is working as designed, but the documentation in read_clipboard specifically is inadequate and could lead to user confusion, this should be classified as a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The read_clipboard function should have its docstring updated to clearly explain that multi-character separators are treated as regex patterns and provide guidance on using re.escape() for literal separators.
