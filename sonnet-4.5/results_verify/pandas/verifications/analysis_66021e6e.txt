## Bug Report Analysis

### Categorization Considerations:

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The error message clearly has swapped variables, showing the invalid input where valid options should be and vice versa
- This violates the principle of clear error reporting and user experience
- The intent of the code is obvious from the variable names and structure: `types` contains valid types, `methodtype` is the user input
- The error message pattern `"X must be one of {valid_options}, got {invalid_input} instead"` is a common pattern in error reporting
- The bug makes debugging harder for users who encounter this error
- The fix is trivial and obvious - swap the two variables in the f-string

**Evidence supporting BUG:**
- Clear mismatch between intent and implementation
- Reproducible with any invalid methodtype value
- Confusing user experience when the error occurs
- No documentation suggests this backwards error message is intentional

#### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The error still prevents invalid values from being used (functional correctness maintained)
- Users can still understand something is wrong, even if the message is confusing

**Counter-argument:** While the validation logic works correctly, the error message is objectively wrong and misleading. This is not about unspecified behavior - it's about an implementation error in the error message formatting.

#### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The error is only triggered when users provide invalid input
- Users providing invalid methodtype values are already doing something wrong
- The validation itself works correctly, preventing bad values

**Counter-argument:** Error messages are a critical part of user experience. When users make mistakes, clear error messages help them correct their code. This bug makes that process harder. The fix is also trivial (swap two variables), so there's no reason not to fix it.

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The public documentation doesn't explicitly show what happens with invalid methodtype values
- No existing tests cover this case

**Counter-argument:** This is not a documentation issue. The code intent is clear, and the error message format is obviously wrong. The documentation doesn't need to specify the exact error message format for this to be a bug.

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Better error messages could be considered an enhancement

**Counter-argument:** This is not requesting a new feature or enhancement. The error message already exists but has a clear implementation bug. Fixing swapped variables is a bug fix, not a feature.

### Final Assessment:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The error message has swapped variables in its f-string formatting, producing objectively incorrect and confusing output. The intent is obvious from the code structure and variable names:
- `types` = the set of valid options
- `methodtype` = the user's input

The error message should show valid options first, then the invalid input, but it does the opposite. This is a simple implementation error that should be fixed.
