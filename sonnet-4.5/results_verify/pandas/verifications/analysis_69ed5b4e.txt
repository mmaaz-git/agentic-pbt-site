BUG REPORT ANALYSIS
==================

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The error message has clearly swapped variables in the f-string formatting
- Current message: "methodtype must be one of invalid, got {'method', 'classmethod', 'staticmethod', 'property'} instead."
- This is objectively backwards and confusing
- The fix is trivial and obvious - swap {methodtype} and {types} in line 298
- This affects user experience when debugging their code
- The error message is part of the public API's error handling
- Clear violation of the principle of least astonishment

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None - this is clearly a bug

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The error only appears when users provide invalid input
- Users who provide correct methodtype values never see this message
- It's a low-severity issue that doesn't affect functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Error messages are important for developer experience
- This is not an obscure edge case - any invalid methodtype triggers this
- The fix is trivial (literally swapping two variables)
- Confusing error messages waste developer time

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug clearly exists

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code demonstrably produces a backwards error message
- The variables are verifiably swapped in the source code
- The reproduction is straightforward and consistent

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly show the error message format
- Could argue the code works as "designed" if we consider the swapped message as intended

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue
- No reasonable person would intentionally design an error message this way
- The error message saying "must be one of invalid" is nonsensical

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue this is requesting "better" error messages

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing a broken error message, not requesting a new feature
- The current message is objectively wrong, not just suboptimal
- Swapped variables is a bug, not a missing feature

## Final Assessment

This is unquestionably a **BUG**. The error message has swapped variables that make it backwards and confusing. The message literally says "methodtype must be one of invalid" which is nonsensical. This is a clear programming error where {methodtype} and {types} are in the wrong positions in the f-string.

The bug:
1. Has a clear, reproducible test case
2. Shows obvious incorrect behavior (swapped variables)
3. Has a trivial fix
4. Affects the user experience when debugging
5. Is not a matter of interpretation or preference

This should be filed as a valid BUG report.
