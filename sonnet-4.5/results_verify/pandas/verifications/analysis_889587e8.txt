## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments for BUG classification:**
1. **Documented behavior conflict**: The docstring explicitly states "Duplicates are allowed" and provides an example with duplicates, yet the function produces warnings for this documented use case
2. **User experience issue**: Users see cryptic RuntimeWarnings despite providing valid input that produces correct output
3. **Inefficiency**: The function performs unnecessary computations (log10 of zero) for a trivial case
4. **Best practice violation**: Well-designed functions should handle expected inputs without warnings
5. **Internal usage impact**: This function is used by `DataFrame.describe()`, a commonly used method, potentially affecting many users

**Why this IS a bug:**
- The function's behavior (producing warnings) contradicts its documentation (duplicates are allowed)
- The warnings are misleading - they suggest something is wrong when the output is correct
- This is not an edge case but a normal use case explicitly mentioned in examples

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
1. The function produces correct output despite warnings
2. The warnings are internal numpy warnings, not pandas-specific
3. Users can suppress warnings if needed

**Why this is NOT WONTFIX:**
- The issue affects a common use case (duplicate percentiles)
- The function is used internally by `DataFrame.describe()`, a frequently used method
- The fix is simple and non-breaking
- Warnings pollute output and logs unnecessarily

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
1. The function technically works correctly - it produces the expected output
2. Warnings are not errors

**Why this is NOT INVALID:**
- The bug report accurately identifies a real issue
- The root cause analysis is correct
- The function does produce warnings for valid, documented input
- The proposed fixes are reasonable

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could be seen as requesting better handling of a special case
2. The current implementation works, just not optimally

**Why this is NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior (warnings for valid input), not adding new functionality
- The docstring already promises duplicate support - this is a bug in implementation
- The function should already handle this case without warnings

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation could be updated to mention that warnings may occur with duplicates
2. The function is internal and not publicly documented

**Why this is NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- The docstring correctly states duplicates are allowed
- Updating docs to say "duplicates allowed but will produce warnings" would be backwards

### CONCLUSION
This is a **BUG**. The function produces RuntimeWarnings for valid, documented input (duplicate percentiles). While the output is correct, generating warnings for expected input violates the principle of least surprise and contradicts the function's own documentation. The issue has:
- Clear reproduction steps
- Correct root cause analysis
- Valid proposed fixes
- Impact on user experience through `DataFrame.describe()`

The bug is low severity (as noted in the report) but is still a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
