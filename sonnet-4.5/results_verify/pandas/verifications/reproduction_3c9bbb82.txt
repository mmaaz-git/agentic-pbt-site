## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for `pandas.core.arrays.sparse.SparseArray.map`.

### Test Environment
- Pandas version: 2.3.2
- Python version: 3.13

### Bug Reproduction

The bug report is accurate. When running the provided test case:

```python
arr = SparseArray([0, 0, 1, 2], fill_value=0)
mapped = arr.map(lambda x: 0 if x == 1 else x)
```

This raises a `ValueError: fill value in the sparse values not supported`

The error occurs because:
1. The array has sparse values [1, 2] with fill value 0
2. The mapper tries to map the sparse value 1 â†’ 0 (which is the fill value)
3. The implementation (lines 1366-1368) explicitly checks if any mapped sparse value equals the fill value and raises an error

### Confirmed Behavior

The implementation contains this explicit check:
```python
if new_sp_val is fill_val or new_sp_val == fill_val:
    msg = "fill value in the sparse values not supported"
    raise ValueError(msg)
```

This prevents any mapping where a sparse value would be mapped to the fill value, even though such a mapping is semantically valid and would just require recalculating which indices are sparse.

### Documentation Contradiction

The docstring at line 1331 clearly states:
"The output array will have the same density as the input."

This statement is misleading because:
1. It implies that density preservation is a guaranteed property
2. It doesn't mention that certain mappings will raise errors
3. The error message doesn't explain that it's related to density preservation

The bug report correctly identifies this as a contract violation between the documented behavior and the actual implementation.
