# Bug Report: pandas.api.typing.NaTType Singleton Pattern Violation

**Target**: `pandas.api.typing.NaTType`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

`NaTType()` creates distinct instances on each call instead of returning the singleton `pd.NaT`, violating the expected singleton pattern and creating inconsistency with `NAType`.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings
import pandas.api.typing as typing
import pandas as pd


@given(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
@settings(max_examples=100)
def test_nattype_singleton_property(n):
    instances = [typing.NaTType() for _ in range(n)]
    if len(instances) > 0:
        first = instances[0]
        for instance in instances[1:]:
            assert instance is first, f"NaTType() should always return the same singleton instance"
            assert instance is pd.NaT, f"NaTType() should return pd.NaT"
```

**Failing input**: `n=2`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas.api.typing as typing

nat1 = typing.NaTType()
nat2 = typing.NaTType()

print(f"nat1 is nat2: {nat1 is nat2}")
print(f"nat1 is pd.NaT: {nat1 is pd.NaT}")

na1 = typing.NAType()
na2 = typing.NAType()

print(f"na1 is na2: {na1 is na2}")
print(f"na1 is pd.NA: {na1 is pd.NA}")
```

Expected output:
```
nat1 is nat2: True
nat1 is pd.NaT: True
na1 is na2: True
na1 is pd.NA: True
```

Actual output:
```
nat1 is nat2: False
nat1 is pd.NaT: False
na1 is na2: True
na1 is pd.NA: True
```

## Why This Is A Bug

1. **Singleton pattern violation**: NaT (Not-a-Time) is documented as a singleton sentinel value, similar to None. Creating multiple distinct instances violates this fundamental design.

2. **Inconsistency with NAType**: `NAType()` correctly returns the same singleton instance (`pd.NA`) on every call. Users would reasonably expect `NaTType()` to behave the same way.

3. **Identity check failures**: Code that relies on identity checks (`is pd.NaT`) will fail unexpectedly when using `NaTType()` instances.

4. **Equality issues**: The created instances don't even compare equal to each other (`nat1 == nat2` returns `False`), further breaking expected singleton semantics.

## Fix

The fix requires modifying the Cython implementation of `NaTType.__new__` to return the singleton instance. The implementation should mirror `NAType.__new__`:

```python
class NaTType:
    def __new__(cls):
        return pd.NaT
```

This ensures all calls to `NaTType()` return the same singleton instance, matching the behavior of `NAType` and maintaining consistency across pandas' missing value types.
