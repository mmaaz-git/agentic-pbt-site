# Bug Report: pandas.io.json._normalize.convert_to_line_delimits Operator Precedence Bug

**Target**: `pandas.io.json._normalize.convert_to_line_delimits`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `convert_to_line_delimits` function has an operator precedence bug in its condition check, causing it to incorrectly process strings that start with `[` but don't end with `]`. The function is supposed to only process valid JSON list strings (those enclosed in `[` and `]`), but due to incorrect operator precedence, it processes malformed inputs.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from pandas.io.json._normalize import convert_to_line_delimits

@given(st.text(min_size=1).filter(lambda s: s[0] == '[' and s[-1] != ']'))
def test_convert_to_line_delimits_malformed_list(s):
    result = convert_to_line_delimits(s)
    assert result == s, f"Malformed JSON list {repr(s)} should be returned unchanged, got {repr(result)}"
```

**Failing input**: `"[abc"`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from pandas.io.json._normalize import convert_to_line_delimits

s = "[abc"
result = convert_to_line_delimits(s)
print(f"Input:  {repr(s)}")
print(f"Output: {repr(result)}")
print(f"Expected: {repr(s)} (unchanged)")

s = "["
result = convert_to_line_delimits(s)
print(f"\nInput:  {repr(s)}")
print(f"Output: {repr(result)}")
print(f"Expected: {repr(s)} (unchanged)")
```

Output:
```
Input:  '[abc'
Output: 'ab\n'
Expected: '[abc' (unchanged)

Input:  '['
Output: '\n'
Expected: '[' (unchanged)
```

## Why This Is A Bug

The function's docstring states it "converts JSON lists to line delimited JSON". A valid JSON list must be enclosed in `[` and `]`. The function should only process strings that both start with `[` AND end with `]`, and return all other inputs unchanged.

However, the condition on line 3 of the function has incorrect operator precedence:

```python
if not s[0] == "[" and s[-1] == "]":
    return s
```

This evaluates as `(not s[0] == "[") and s[-1] == "]"` instead of `not (s[0] == "[" and s[-1] == "]")`.

As a result:
- For `s = "[abc"`: The condition evaluates to `(False) and (False)` = `False`, so the function incorrectly processes the string
- For `s = "abc]"`: The condition evaluates to `(True) and (True)` = `True`, so the function correctly returns it unchanged
- For `s = "[...]"`: The condition evaluates to `(False) and (True)` = `False`, so the function correctly processes it
