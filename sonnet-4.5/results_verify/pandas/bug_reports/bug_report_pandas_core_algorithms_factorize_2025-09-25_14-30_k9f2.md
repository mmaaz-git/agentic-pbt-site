# Bug Report: pandas.core.algorithms.factorize Null Character String Collision

**Target**: `pandas.core.algorithms.factorize`
**Severity**: High
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `factorize` function incorrectly treats strings containing only null characters (`\x00`) as identical to the empty string or other null-character-only strings, violating its documented round-trip property that "uniques.take(codes) will have the same values as values".

## Property-Based Test

```python
import numpy as np
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings
from pandas.core.algorithms import factorize

@given(st.lists(st.text(min_size=0, max_size=10)))
@settings(max_examples=1000)
def test_factorize_roundtrip_strings(values):
    values_array = np.array(values, dtype=object)
    codes, uniques = factorize(values_array)

    reconstructed = uniques.take(codes[codes >= 0])
    original_non_nan = values_array[codes >= 0]

    assert len(reconstructed) == len(original_non_nan)
    assert np.array_equal(reconstructed, original_non_nan)
```

**Failing input**: `values=['', '\x00']`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.algorithms import factorize

values = np.array(['', '\x00'], dtype=object)
codes, uniques = factorize(values)

print(f"Input: {[repr(v) for v in values]}")
print(f"Codes: {codes}")
print(f"Uniques: {[repr(v) for v in uniques]}")

reconstructed = uniques.take(codes)
print(f"Reconstructed: {[repr(v) for v in reconstructed]}")
print(f"Match: {np.array_equal(reconstructed, values)}")
```

**Output:**
```
Input: ["''", "'\\x00'"]
Codes: [0 0]
Uniques: ["''"]
Reconstructed: ["''", "''"]
Match: False
```

**Expected behavior:** The two distinct strings `''` (empty) and `'\x00'` (null character) should receive different codes and both should appear in `uniques`.

**Additional failing cases:**
- `['\x00', '\x00\x00']` - single null char collides with double null char
- `['', '\x00', 'a']` - empty and null char collide even with other values present

**Working correctly:**
- `['', '\x01']` - empty and `\x01` are correctly distinguished
- `['', 'a']` - empty and regular char work fine

## Why This Is A Bug

1. **Violates documented contract**: The docstring explicitly states: "codes : ndarray - An integer ndarray that's an indexer into `uniques`. **`uniques.take(codes)` will have the same values as `values`.**" This property is violated.

2. **Incorrect behavior**: The empty string `''` and the null character `'\x00'` are distinct values in Python (`'' != '\x00'`, `len('') = 0`, `len('\x00') = 1`). They should be factorized to different codes.

3. **Data corruption**: Users factorizing data with null characters will have their data silently corrupted - distinct values will be mapped to the same code, losing information.

4. **Affects realistic use cases**: Null characters can legitimately appear in:
   - Binary data represented as strings
   - C-string data imported from external sources
   - Text data with control characters
   - Database values with embedded nulls

## Fix

The bug appears to be in the underlying hash table or string comparison logic, likely treating `\x00` as a C-style string terminator instead of a valid character. The factorization code needs to properly handle strings containing null bytes.

Investigation suggests the issue is in the internal factorization implementation (possibly in `factorize_array` or lower-level hash table code) where null-terminated string semantics are being incorrectly applied to Python strings, which are length-prefixed and can contain null bytes.

The fix would require ensuring that string comparison and hashing in the factorization code properly handles the full string content including null bytes, not treating `\x00` as a terminator.
