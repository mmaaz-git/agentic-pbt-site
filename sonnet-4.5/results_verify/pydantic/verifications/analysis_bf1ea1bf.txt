## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This is an internal implementation detail of an EXPERIMENTAL API. The documentation explicitly states the API is "subject to change or removal" and nowhere does it specify that constraints must be implemented consistently internally. The validation works correctly in all cases - values that should pass do pass, values that should fail do fail. The bug report complains about HOW the validation is done internally (one validator vs two), not whether it works. Since this is experimental code with no documented performance guarantees or implementation requirements, complaining about internal efficiency is outside the scope of valid bug reports.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code shows a clear inconsistency where Gt has an else clause but Ge/Lt/Le do not, suggesting this may be an oversight rather than intentional design. The original developer clearly knew to use else for Gt to avoid double validation, so the absence of else in the other three cases appears to be a mistake. The bug report provides concrete evidence with line numbers showing the exact issue.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The performance impact is minimal (16% slower for valid values, negligible for invalid), making this a trivial optimization issue. The code works correctly, and for an experimental API, perfect efficiency is not a requirement. The double validation doesn't cause any functional problems - it's just slightly less efficient. Given that this is experimental code that may be completely rewritten before becoming stable, fixing minor efficiency issues is likely not worth the effort.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial - just add else clauses to match the Gt pattern. It's literally adding 3 words ("else:") and adjusting indentation. The inconsistency makes the code harder to understand and maintain. If all four constraints used the same pattern, the code would be cleaner and more predictable. This isn't about the magnitude of the performance impact but about code consistency and correctness.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be clearer that the experimental API makes no guarantees about internal implementation efficiency or consistency. If users are examining internal schemas and expecting consistency, perhaps the docs should explicitly state that internal implementation details may vary and should not be relied upon. The experimental warning could be more explicit about what aspects are subject to change.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation already clearly states this is experimental and subject to change. There's no documentation claiming that constraints are implemented consistently internally. The functional behavior (what values pass/fail validation) is correctly documented and implemented. This isn't a documentation issue - the docs never promised anything about internal implementation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Optimizing the constraint implementations for consistency and performance could be seen as a new feature - "make experimental pipeline constraints more efficient." Since the current implementation works correctly, making it faster/cleaner is an enhancement, not a bug fix. This could be framed as "Feature Request: Optimize Ge/Lt/Le constraint implementation to match Gt pattern."

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality - all four constraints already exist and work. The issue is that three of them have redundant validation that the fourth one correctly avoids. This is fixing an implementation oversight, not adding a new capability. The code already shows the correct pattern in Gt; applying it to the others is fixing inconsistency, not adding features.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code clearly shows an inconsistency where one constraint (Gt) correctly uses an else clause to avoid double validation, while three others (Ge/Lt/Le) are missing this else clause. This appears to be an obvious oversight - the developer knew to use else for Gt but forgot to apply the same pattern to the others. The inconsistency makes the code harder to understand, less efficient, and suggests a copy-paste error or incomplete refactoring. The fix is trivial and makes the code objectively better.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an EXPERIMENTAL API explicitly marked as subject to change. The validation works correctly in all cases - the only issue is internal efficiency. Performance optimization in experimental code is not a bug unless it causes functional incorrectness. The 16% performance difference is negligible for most use cases. Users should not be examining or relying on internal schema structure of experimental APIs. The different implementations might be intentional for testing or comparison purposes in experimental code.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report identifies a real inconsistency in the codebase where Gt correctly avoids double validation using an else clause, while Ge/Lt/Le are missing this optimization. The technical analysis is accurate and the fix is trivial. However, three critical factors argue against this being a valid bug:

First, this is an EXPERIMENTAL API with explicit warnings that it is "subject to change or removal." Experimental APIs are not held to the same standards of implementation consistency or performance optimization as stable APIs. Users who choose to use experimental features accept that the implementation may be suboptimal or inconsistent as the feature is still being developed and refined.

Second, the issue has NO functional impact - all validations work correctly, accepting and rejecting the appropriate values. The complaint is purely about internal implementation efficiency, which is not part of the API contract. The ~16% performance difference for valid values is negligible for virtually all real-world use cases. This is a micro-optimization in code that may be completely rewritten before becoming stable.

Third, the bug report relies on examining internal schema structure (`__pydantic_core_schema__`), which is not part of the public API. Users should not be inspecting or depending on internal implementation details, especially in experimental code. The number of internal validators used is an implementation detail that can change at any time without being considered a breaking change or bug. While the inconsistency is real and the fix would be trivial, experimental code is expected to have such rough edges that get cleaned up before stabilization.
