## Reproduction Report

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### 1. Hypothesis Test Execution
The hypothesis test provided in the bug report runs without errors, though it doesn't fail immediately because the assertion about redundancy is checking for both a schema constraint AND a validator function, but the way the code detects the validator wasn't capturing it properly in the test.

### 2. Direct Schema Inspection
When I directly inspected the schemas generated by the different constraint types, the bug became immediately apparent:

**Gt constraint (CORRECT behavior):**
- Schema: `{'type': 'int', 'gt': 5}`
- This is a simple, clean schema with only the constraint at the schema level

**Ge/Lt/Le constraints (BUGGY behavior):**
- Schema for Ge: `{'function': {...}, 'schema': {'type': 'int', 'ge': 5}, 'type': 'function-after'}`
- Similar structures for Lt and Le
- These have BOTH:
  1. The schema-level constraint (`'ge': 5` in the inner schema)
  2. A validator function wrapped in a `function-after` structure

### 3. Source Code Verification
I examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/experimental/pipeline.py`:

- Lines 448-463: The `Gt` implementation correctly uses an `else` clause (line 458), ensuring the validator function is only added when schema constraints aren't applicable
- Lines 464-478: The `Ge` implementation lacks the `else` clause - the validator function (lines 475-478) is ALWAYS added
- Lines 479-493: The `Lt` implementation has the same issue - no `else` clause
- Lines 494-508: The `Le` implementation also lacks the `else` clause

### 4. Impact
This bug causes redundant validation where:
1. The schema-level constraint checks the value (efficient, handled by pydantic-core)
2. The validator function checks the same constraint again (less efficient, Python function call)

This results in:
- Performance degradation due to double validation
- Unnecessarily complex schemas
- Inconsistent behavior between Gt and Ge/Lt/Le constraints

The bug report is accurate in its description, code references, and proposed fix.
