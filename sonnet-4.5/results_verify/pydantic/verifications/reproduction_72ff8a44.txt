# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the pydantic.deprecated.json bytes encoder. The bug causes a crash when encoding bytes containing non-UTF-8 sequences.

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Hypothesis Test
The property-based test provided in the bug report correctly identifies the issue:
- Test: `@given(st.binary(min_size=1, max_size=100))`
- Failing input: `b'\x80'` (and any other invalid UTF-8 byte sequences)
- Error: `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte`

### 2. Manual Test Case
The manual test case with `b'\x80\x81\x82'` also reproduces the crash:
- Input: `json.dumps(b'\x80\x81\x82', default=pydantic_encoder)`
- Result: `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte`

### 3. Code Examination
I examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/deprecated/json.py`, line 55:
```python
bytes: lambda o: o.decode(),
```

The code indeed calls `o.decode()` without specifying encoding or error handling, which causes it to:
1. Default to UTF-8 encoding
2. Default to 'strict' error handling
3. Raise UnicodeDecodeError on invalid UTF-8 sequences

## Effect
The bug causes the pydantic_encoder function to crash with UnicodeDecodeError whenever it attempts to encode bytes objects that contain non-UTF-8 sequences. This is a real issue because:
- Bytes can contain arbitrary binary data, not just UTF-8 text
- The encoder is meant to handle serialization of Python types for JSON
- A crash prevents the entire JSON serialization from completing

## Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. The pydantic_encoder function crashes when handling bytes with non-UTF-8 sequences due to calling decode() without proper error handling.
