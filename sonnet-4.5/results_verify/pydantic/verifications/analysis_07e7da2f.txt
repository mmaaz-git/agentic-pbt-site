## Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Clear inconsistency**: The Gt constraint correctly uses an `else` clause to avoid redundant validation, while Ge/Lt/Le do not
2. **Performance impact**: Double validation causes unnecessary overhead
3. **Structural evidence**: The bug creates unnecessarily complex schemas with both schema-level constraints and validator functions
4. **Pattern violation**: The implementation violates the pattern established by the Gt constraint in the same function
5. **Easy to fix**: The solution is straightforward - add `else` clauses to match Gt's implementation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Module is marked as experimental and subject to change
- Could theoretically be intentional for extra validation robustness

**Assessment: STRONG case for BUG**

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Module is experimental, so behavior might be undefined

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The bug is about internal consistency within the same function
2. The Gt implementation shows clear intent to avoid redundancy
3. Performance degradation from double validation is objectively bad
4. The fix aligns with obvious best practices

**Assessment: WEAK case for INVALID**

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Module is experimental and might be rewritten anyway
2. The redundant validation still produces correct results
3. Performance impact might be considered negligible

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Easy fix that improves performance
2. Makes the code internally consistent
3. The bug affects core functionality of the constraints
4. Fix is low-risk and straightforward

**Assessment: WEAK case for WONTFIX**

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame optimization as a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. The Gt constraint already implements the correct pattern
3. The issue is about consistency and performance, not new capabilities

**Assessment: NOT a feature request**

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly say constraints shouldn't be redundant

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code behavior is inconsistent within itself
2. The Gt implementation shows the intended pattern
3. This is a code bug, not a documentation issue
4. No reasonable documentation would specify redundant validation as correct

**Assessment: NOT a documentation issue**

## Final Verdict: BUG

This is a valid bug report that should remain open and tagged as BUG. The evidence overwhelmingly supports this:

1. **Internal inconsistency**: Within the same function, Gt handles constraints correctly while Ge/Lt/Le do not
2. **Clear fix**: The solution is obvious - add `else` clauses to match Gt's implementation
3. **Performance impact**: Redundant validation degrades performance unnecessarily
4. **Not intentional**: The pattern established by Gt shows this is an oversight, not design
5. **Correctness**: While the redundant validation produces correct results, it's inefficient and creates unnecessarily complex schemas

The experimental status of the module doesn't invalidate bug reports about obvious implementation errors. This is a clear case where the code doesn't follow its own established patterns.
