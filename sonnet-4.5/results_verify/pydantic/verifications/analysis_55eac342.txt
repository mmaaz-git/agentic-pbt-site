## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for Each Category

#### 1. INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The API is marked as experimental and subject to change
- One could argue that constraint types should match field types

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The bug causes complete validation failure (no validation at all)
- Other comparison operators (ge, lt, le) work correctly with type mismatches
- Mathematical comparisons between integers and floats are well-defined
- The API accepts the syntax without error, creating reasonable expectations

#### 2. WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The experimental API warning could justify not fixing edge cases
- Could be considered an obscure edge case

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is a serious data validation failure, not a minor issue
- Silent validation failures are dangerous in production code
- The fix is trivial (2-line change as shown in the bug report)
- Inconsistent behavior between gt() and other operators is confusing

#### 3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state type mismatch behavior

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The natural interpretation is that gt(5.5) should reject values â‰¤ 5.5
- Other operators work as expected with type mismatches
- This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue
- The proposed fix makes the code match expected behavior

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Cross-type validation could be seen as a new feature

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The functionality already exists for ge(), lt(), le()
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The API already accepts the syntax; it just doesn't work

#### 5. BUG
**Why this IS a BUG:**
- The constraint completely fails to validate when types don't match
- Silent validation failures are serious security/data integrity issues
- Inconsistent behavior: gt() fails while ge(), lt(), le() work correctly
- The code structure clearly shows this is an implementation error
- The fix is straightforward and makes gt() consistent with other operators
- Mathematical comparisons between int and float are well-defined (5 > 5.5 = False)
- The API accepts the syntax without error but doesn't work as expected

### Final Assessment

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. **Functional Failure**: The gt() constraint doesn't validate AT ALL when there's a type mismatch, allowing any value through
2. **Inconsistency**: All other comparison operators (ge, lt, le) handle type mismatches correctly
3. **Clear Code Error**: The source code shows check_gt is incorrectly scoped inside an else block
4. **Security Impact**: Silent validation failures can lead to serious data integrity issues
5. **Simple Fix**: The 2-line fix provided makes gt() behave consistently with other operators

The experimental status of the API doesn't excuse basic functionality being completely broken, especially when the fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent.
