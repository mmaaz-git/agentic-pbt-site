## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluating as BUG:
**Arguments FOR:**
- The current implementation loses color information for edge cases (very dark/light colors)
- CSS3 specification allows decimal places in percentages, so the fix would be standards-compliant
- Users reasonably expect color representations to preserve information when technically possible
- The loss of precision is silent and non-obvious, leading to data loss
- The fix is simple and backward-compatible (adding decimal places)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise round-trip conversion
- The current format (integer percentages) is also valid CSS3

### Evaluating as INVALID:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation never promises round-trip conversion through HSL
- The behavior follows CSS3 spec (0% is valid for black)
- Round-tripping through string representations isn't always expected to work perfectly

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code does correctly parse HSL with decimal places when provided
- Losing color information unnecessarily seems like a genuine defect
- Other color representations (hex, rgb) preserve full precision

### Evaluating as WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Edge case affecting only very dark/light colors (RGB values 0-2 or 253-255)
- Most practical use cases wouldn't encounter this issue
- Current behavior is technically correct (0.39% rounds to 0%)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial and doesn't break compatibility
- Data loss for valid colors is not a trivial issue
- CSS3 explicitly allows decimal precision

### Evaluating as FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Adding decimal precision could be seen as an enhancement
- Current behavior is "correct" per integer rounding rules
- This is asking for better precision, not fixing broken functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is about preserving existing data, not adding new capabilities
- The method already handles decimal input correctly when parsing
- Asymmetric precision (parse decimals, output integers) seems like a bug

### Evaluating as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that HSL representation may lose precision for edge colors
- Could clarify that round-trip conversion isn't guaranteed

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior itself seems problematic, not just the documentation
- Users shouldn't need warnings about basic color preservation

### Conclusion:
This is a **BUG**. While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise round-trip conversion, the loss of color information for valid RGB values is unexpected behavior that violates reasonable user expectations. The fact that:
1. CSS3 allows decimal precision in percentages
2. The parser already handles decimal values correctly
3. The fix is simple and backward-compatible
4. Other color representations preserve full precision

All point to this being a genuine defect rather than a documentation issue or feature request. The asymmetry between parsing (accepts decimals) and output (uses integers only) particularly suggests this is an oversight rather than intentional design.
