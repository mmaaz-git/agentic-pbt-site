TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   PROS:
   - Clear inconsistency in implementation between gt() and ge/lt/le()
   - Redundant validation is objectively occurring (validated twice)
   - The fix is straightforward (add else clauses)
   - gt() shows the correct pattern was intended
   - No functional benefit to the redundant validation
   - Performance impact (minor but unnecessary)
   CONS:
   - Code still works correctly functionally
   - Marked as experimental/subject to change

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   PROS:
   - Performance impact is likely minimal in practice
   - Module is experimental and marked for potential deprecation
   - Doesn't cause incorrect behavior, just inefficiency
   CONS:
   - Clear implementation inconsistency
   - Easy to fix
   - Shows lack of attention to code quality

3. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
   PROS:
   - None - the bug is demonstrably real
   CONS:
   - Code inspection confirms the issue
   - Testing confirms redundant validation
   - Bug report is technically accurate

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality request)
   PROS:
   - Could argue optimization is a "feature"
   CONS:
   - This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
   - gt() already has the optimization, so it's not new
   - The pattern exists, just not applied consistently

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
   PROS:
   - Documentation doesn't specify optimization behavior
   CONS:
   - This is clearly a code issue, not documentation
   - No documentation claims the redundancy is intentional
   - Users wouldn't expect redundant validation

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

The bug is REAL and VERIFIED:
- The code shows gt() uses if/else pattern to avoid redundancy
- ge/lt/le are missing the else clause, causing double validation
- When an int schema gets a ge(5) constraint, it:
  1. Adds 'ge': 5 to the schema (for native validation)
  2. ALSO wraps it with a function validator (redundant)

This is clearly unintentional because:
1. gt() shows the correct pattern was known
2. No reason to validate the same constraint twice
3. Inconsistent behavior between similar operations
4. The fix is trivial (add else clauses)

Severity Assessment:
- LOW severity (as stated in bug report)
- No functional incorrectness
- Minor performance impact
- But clear code quality issue

The module being experimental doesn't invalidate bugs - it just means the API might change.

RECOMMENDATION: BUG
This is a valid bug showing inconsistent implementation that causes unnecessary redundant validation. While the impact is low, the issue is real, the fix is simple, and consistency in similar operations is a reasonable expectation.
