# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The bytes encoder in `pydantic.deprecated.json.ENCODERS_BY_TYPE[bytes]` indeed crashes with a `UnicodeDecodeError` when attempting to encode bytes that contain non-UTF-8 data.

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Hypothesis Test**: Ran the property-based test provided in the bug report. The test failed on the first non-UTF-8 byte value `b'\x80'`, exactly as stated in the report.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: Tested the specific failing case `b'\x80'`:
   - Input: `b'\x80'` (a single byte with value 128, which is not valid UTF-8)
   - Output: `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte`
   - This matches exactly what the bug report claims

3. **Valid UTF-8 Test**: Confirmed that the encoder works correctly with valid UTF-8 bytes:
   - Input: `b'Hello, World!'`
   - Output: `'Hello, World!'` (successful string conversion)

## Technical Analysis

The issue is in line 55 of `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/deprecated/json.py`:
```python
bytes: lambda o: o.decode(),
```

The `decode()` method without arguments defaults to UTF-8 decoding, which fails on any byte sequence that is not valid UTF-8. Since bytes can contain arbitrary binary data (values 0x00-0xFF), many valid byte sequences will cause this encoder to crash.

## Impact

This bug affects any use case where:
- Binary data needs to be JSON-encoded (images, encrypted data, compressed data)
- Raw protocol data or file data is processed
- Any bytes with values >= 0x80 that don't form valid UTF-8 sequences

The bug is real, reproducible, and matches the report's description exactly.
