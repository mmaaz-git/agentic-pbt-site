## Documentation Findings for pydantic.color.Color

The pydantic.color.Color class is documented in the module docstring and method docstrings. Key findings:

1. **Module Documentation**: The Color class follows the CSS3 Color Module Level 3 specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color). The class is deprecated in favor of pydantic_extra_types.

2. **as_hsl() Method Documentation**:
   - Docstring states: "Color as an `hsl(<h>, <s>, <l>)` or `hsl(<h>, <s>, <l>, <a>)` string."
   - Implementation uses format strings with 0 decimal places: `f'hsl({h * 360:0.0f}, {s:0.0%}, {li:0.0%})'`
   - No documentation about precision requirements or round-trip guarantees

3. **as_hsl_tuple() Method Documentation**:
   - Returns HSL values as floats in range 0 to 1
   - Notes this is "HSL as used in HTML and most other places, not HLS as used in Python's colorsys"

4. **Equality Implementation**:
   - The `__eq__` method compares colors using `as_rgb_tuple()`, not the original representation
   - This implies colors are considered equal if they have the same RGB values

5. **CSS3 Specification**:
   - The CSS3 spec defines HSL format with percentages for saturation and lightness
   - The spec provides conversion algorithms but does NOT specify:
     - Required precision for HSL values
     - Round-trip conversion guarantees between RGB and HSL
     - How many decimal places should be used in HSL string representation

6. **No Round-trip Guarantees**:
   - Neither the pydantic documentation nor the CSS3 specification make any claims about round-trip conversion fidelity
   - The documentation does not promise that `Color(color.as_hsl()) == color`
   - The as_hsl() method is described as a string representation method, not a serialization method

7. **String Representation Purpose**:
   - The as_hsl() method appears to be intended for human-readable output, not for data serialization
   - The method follows CSS3 syntax for compatibility with web standards
