## Documentation Analysis for multiple_of Constraint

### Official Documentation Findings

From the Pydantic v1.10 documentation:

1. **Constrained Types Documentation**:
   - For `conint()`, the `multiple_of` parameter is documented as: "enforces integer to be a multiple of the set value"
   - Example: `mod_int: conint(multiple_of=5)` ensures the integer must be divisible by 5 without remainder

2. **Field Function Documentation**:
   - The `Field()` function accepts `multiple_of` as a constraint parameter
   - Used for numeric validation: `value: int = Field(multiple_of=5)`
   - Generates JSON Schema with `"multipleOf": 5` annotation

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The documentation clearly states that `multiple_of` enforces that an integer must be a multiple of the specified value
   - A multiple means the value divided by the constraint should have no remainder

2. **No Mentioned Limitations**:
   - The documentation does NOT mention any limitations with large integers
   - No warnings about precision issues with numbers > 2^53
   - No caveats about float conversion affecting validation

3. **Mathematical Definition**:
   - The mathematical definition of "multiple of" is unambiguous: `n` is a multiple of `m` if `n % m == 0`
   - The documentation implies this mathematical correctness for all valid integers

### Documentation vs Implementation

The documentation promises that `multiple_of=5` will enforce that integers are multiples of 5. There are no documented exceptions or limitations for large integers. Users would reasonably expect:

1. `10^16 + 1` with `multiple_of=5` should raise ValidationError (since 10^16 + 1 % 5 = 1)
2. All integers that are not multiples should be rejected, regardless of size
3. The validation should be mathematically correct for all valid Python integers

### Conclusion

The implementation violates the documented behavior. The documentation makes an unqualified promise about validating multiples, which the code fails to deliver for large integers. There are no documented limitations that would excuse this behavior.
