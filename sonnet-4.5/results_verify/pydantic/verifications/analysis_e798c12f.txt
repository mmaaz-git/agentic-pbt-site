## Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise - validation errors should always be propagated
- Plugin handlers are described as "callbacks to be notified" which implies they should be observational
- A misbehaving plugin should not be able to mask validation errors from the application
- The fix is straightforward and improves robustness
- This creates a debugging nightmare where validation errors can disappear
- The handler protocol returns None, suggesting they shouldn't affect control flow

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly say what happens when handlers raise exceptions
- Could be considered undefined behavior since it's not documented

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that ValidationErrors will be preserved if handlers fail
- Plugin system is marked as "experimental" and subject to change
- Handlers raising exceptions could be considered misuse of the API

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The name "on_error" and description "callback to be notified" strongly suggests observational behavior
- It's reasonable to expect that validation errors should always propagate
- Even if not explicitly documented, suppressing validation errors is clearly problematic behavior

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Plugin system is experimental, so edge cases might not be prioritized
- Could argue that handlers shouldn't raise exceptions in the first place
- Might be considered an obscure edge case

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - any plugin bug could trigger this
- The impact is significant - lost validation errors are a serious problem
- The fix is simple and improves overall robustness

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't specify what happens when handlers raise exceptions
- Could update docs to say "handlers must not raise exceptions"
- Could document that handler exceptions will replace validation errors

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current behavior is clearly problematic and should be fixed in code
- Documenting bad behavior doesn't make it right
- The reasonable expectation is that validation errors propagate

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could frame this as requesting a new feature: "exception-safe plugin handlers"
- The current code doesn't explicitly handle this case

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Preserving validation errors is fundamental, not a feature
- The current behavior is a bug, not a missing feature

## Conclusion

This should be categorized as **BUG** because:

1. **Fundamental Violation**: Suppressing validation errors violates a fundamental principle of validation frameworks - errors must be propagated to the caller

2. **Reasonable Expectations**: Even without explicit documentation, it's reasonable to expect that:
   - Validation errors always reach the caller
   - Plugin handlers are observational (as their names and descriptions suggest)
   - A buggy plugin shouldn't corrupt the validation process

3. **Significant Impact**: This isn't a trivial edge case - it can make debugging extremely difficult and cause validation errors to be silently lost

4. **Clear Fix**: The suggested fix (wrapping handler calls in try-except) is straightforward and improves robustness

5. **Intent from Design**: The handler protocol returns None and is described as "callback to be notified", strongly suggesting observational intent

The fact that the documentation doesn't explicitly specify this behavior doesn't make it acceptable - some behaviors are so fundamentally wrong that they don't need to be explicitly prohibited in documentation.
