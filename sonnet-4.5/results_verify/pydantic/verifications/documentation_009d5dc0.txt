## Documentation Analysis

### Pydantic Documentation
The Pydantic v1 documentation for the Color type indicates:
- The `as_hsl()` method returns HSL string representations in CSS3-compatible format
- It follows the CSS3 color specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color)
- No explicit guarantees are made about round-trip conversion precision
- No specific decimal precision requirements are documented

### CSS3 Color Specification
The CSS3 specification:
- Allows decimal places in HSL percentage values (not restricted to integers)
- Does not mandate any specific precision for HSL percentages
- Shows that implementations should clip values below 0% to 0%
- Does not explicitly require round-trip conversion to preserve original values

### Code Documentation
Looking at the source code docstrings:
- Line 154-156: "Color as an hsl(<h>, <s>, <l>) or hsl(<h>, <s>, <l>, <a>) string."
- No mention of expected precision or round-trip behavior
- The comment at line 2-3 references CSS3 specification compliance

### Key Finding
The documentation does NOT explicitly state that:
1. Round-trip conversion through HSL should preserve the original RGB values
2. Any specific decimal precision should be used for HSL percentages
3. Very dark/light colors should maintain their subtle differences

However, it's worth noting that:
- CSS3 allows decimal places in percentages, so using them would be standards-compliant
- The loss of precision for edge cases (very dark/light colors) is not documented as expected behavior
- Users would reasonably expect color representations to preserve color information when possible
