DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR pydantic.alias_generators.to_pascal

## Official Documentation Found

The function documentation (docstring) states:
```
to_pascal(snake: str) -> str
    Convert a snake_case string to PascalCase.

    Args:
        snake: The string to convert.

    Returns:
        The PascalCase string.
```

## Implementation Details

The source code shows:
```python
def to_pascal(snake: str) -> str:
    camel = snake.title()
    return re.sub('([0-9A-Za-z])_(?=[0-9A-Z])', lambda m: m.group(1), camel)
```

## Documentation Analysis

1. **Function Purpose**: The documentation explicitly states the function converts "snake_case string to PascalCase". The parameter is even named "snake", strongly suggesting this function expects snake_case input.

2. **No Idempotence Guarantee**: The documentation makes NO claims about idempotence. It does not state that:
   - The function should be idempotent
   - Applying it twice should produce the same result
   - It should detect if a string is already in PascalCase
   - It should handle non-snake_case input properly

3. **Input Expectations**: The function clearly expects snake_case input (the parameter is literally named "snake"). There's no documentation about what happens when you provide:
   - Already PascalCase strings
   - All uppercase strings like 'AA'
   - Mixed case strings
   - Strings without underscores

4. **Use Context**: Based on Pydantic documentation, this function is primarily used as an alias_generator for model field transformations, where fields are typically defined in snake_case Python convention and need to be converted to PascalCase for external APIs.

5. **No Round-trip Guarantee**: The documentation doesn't claim that snake_case -> PascalCase -> PascalCase should work. The function is designed for a one-way transformation.

## Key Finding

The documentation clearly describes this as a snake_case to PascalCase converter. It makes no promises about:
- Handling already-converted strings
- Being idempotent
- Recognizing PascalCase input
- Round-trip conversions

The function is behaving exactly as documented: it converts snake_case to PascalCase. When given non-snake_case input (like 'AA' which has no underscores), the behavior is undefined by the documentation.
