## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation never promises that round-tripping between RGB and HSL formats will preserve exact RGB values. The `as_hsl()` method's docstring only describes the output format ("Color as an `hsl(<h>, <s>, <l>)` string") without any precision guarantees. HSL strings are typically used for CSS/display purposes, not for exact serialization. The expectation that colors should round-trip exactly is an unspecified assumption not supported by the documentation.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The Color class provides both serialization (`as_hsl()`) and parsing (`Color(hsl_str)`) methods, which could reasonably imply they should work together reliably. When a library provides both encoding and decoding functions, users might reasonably expect round-tripping to work, even if not explicitly documented.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a minor precision issue affecting only 1-2 RGB units out of 255, which is imperceptible to human vision. The Color class is already deprecated in favor of `pydantic_extra_types`, so fixing deprecated code seems low priority. The precision loss is inherent to formatting percentages with limited decimal places, and perfect round-tripping was never a design goal for display-oriented formats like HSL strings.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue causes test failures for users who reasonably expect round-tripping to work. The fix is simple (adding one decimal place) and wouldn't break existing code. Even deprecated code should work correctly for users still on v2.x before migration.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code behaves reasonably (formatting HSL for display with reasonable precision), but the documentation should clarify that `as_hsl()` is for display purposes and doesn't guarantee round-trip preservation. Adding a note about precision limitations would prevent user confusion without changing working code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting the precision loss doesn't address the underlying issue that the methods don't work well together. If methods can parse each other's output, they should do so reliably, not just have their limitations documented.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Perfect round-tripping between RGB and HSL wasn't originally designed or promised, so adding it would be a new feature. The current behavior (display-oriented HSL strings) works as intended, and requesting higher precision for round-tripping is asking for enhanced functionality beyond the original scope.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality but fixing existing functionality that doesn't work correctly. The methods already exist to convert to and from HSL; they just have a precision bug. Fixing precision issues is bug fixing, not feature addition.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Users reasonably expect that `Color(color.as_hsl())` should return an equivalent color, but it changes RGB values by up to 2-3 units. The library provides complementary serialization and parsing methods that should work together. The precision loss is due to unnecessarily restrictive formatting that could be easily improved.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation never guarantees round-trip preservation. HSL format is primarily for CSS/display where integer percentages are standard. A 1-2 unit difference in RGB (less than 1% error) is negligible for color display purposes. The class is deprecated, suggesting this behavior is considered acceptable.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report concerns precision loss when round-tripping colors through HSL format in a deprecated class. The core issue is that `as_hsl()` rounds percentages to integers, losing precision that cannot be recovered when parsing back.

The strongest argument for INVALID is that the documentation never promises round-trip preservation, and HSL strings are clearly intended for display/CSS purposes where integer percentages are standard. The method works correctly for its intended purpose of generating CSS-compliant HSL strings. Users expecting perfect round-tripping are making an undocumented assumption.

Given that the Color class is explicitly deprecated with warnings pointing users to migrate to `pydantic_extra_types`, fixing precision issues in deprecated code seems like poor resource allocation. The error magnitude (1-2 RGB units) is imperceptible to humans and unlikely to affect real applications. This makes it a WONTFIX candidate - technically correct but too minor and in deprecated code to merit fixing.
