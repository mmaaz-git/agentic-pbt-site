## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The `encoding` parameter is explicitly part of the function signature but is ignored for pickle protocol when encoding strings
- This creates asymmetric behavior: JSON protocol uses `encoding` for bytes->string, but pickle protocol ignores it for string->bytes
- The bug causes real failures when pickle data containing non-ASCII bytes is passed as a string with non-UTF8 encoding specified
- The fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent: change `b.encode()` to `b.encode(encoding)`
- Users who specify an encoding parameter reasonably expect it to be used

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is deprecated, so fixing it may not be worthwhile
- The typical use case for pickle is to pass bytes directly, not strings

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is deprecated and users shouldn't be using it
- There's no documentation specifying how the encoding parameter should work with pickle

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug causes actual crashes with valid use cases
- The encoding parameter exists in the signature and should work as expected
- The JSON protocol DOES use the encoding parameter correctly, setting precedent

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is already deprecated
- Users can work around by passing bytes directly instead of strings
- Fixing deprecated code may not be worth the effort

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- The bug causes crashes, not just incorrect behavior
- Even deprecated code should work correctly while it exists

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- There's no documentation explaining that encoding is ignored for pickle+string

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The lack of documentation doesn't make the current behavior correct
- Adding documentation that "encoding is ignored for pickle" would be documenting a bug
- The code should be fixed, not the (non-existent) documentation

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that supporting encoding for pickle+string is a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The encoding parameter already exists in the signature
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality
- The JSON protocol already supports this, so it's not a new capability

### Conclusion

This is a **BUG**.

The strongest evidence:
1. The function has an `encoding` parameter that is used correctly for JSON but ignored for pickle
2. This inconsistency causes actual crashes when users pass pickle data as strings with non-UTF8 encoding
3. The fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent with user expectations
4. Even though the function is deprecated, it should work correctly while it exists

The fact that it's deprecated might make it low priority, but it's still a legitimate bug that breaks functionality in a way users wouldn't expect.
