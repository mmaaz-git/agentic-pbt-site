BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Consideration for Each Category:

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code clearly shows inconsistent implementation between Gt and Ge/Lt/Le/MultipleOf constraints
- Gt has an `else:` clause to apply validator ONLY when schema constraint can't be used
- Ge/Lt/Le/MultipleOf lack the `else:` clause, causing BOTH schema constraint AND validator to be applied
- This causes unnecessary double validation and performance overhead
- The inconsistency appears unintentional (likely copy-paste error)
- The fix is simple and makes the code consistent

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The module is marked as experimental, so inconsistencies might be expected
- Double validation doesn't break functionality (just inefficient)

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug is demonstrably real

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code examination and testing clearly show the issue exists
- The inconsistency is verifiable in the source code

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The module is experimental and may be redesigned anyway
- The performance impact might be negligible for most use cases
- Double validation doesn't cause incorrect behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (just adding `else:` clauses)
- The inconsistency makes the code harder to maintain
- Performance matters, especially for validation that runs frequently
- Consistency in implementation is a basic code quality standard

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be reframed as "request for consistent constraint handling"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken/inconsistent existing code, not adding new functionality
- The Gt implementation already shows the intended pattern

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't specify the expected behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a code issue, not a documentation issue
- The code pattern (Gt with `else:`) shows the intended implementation
- No documentation suggests double validation is intentional

## Conclusion:

This is a **BUG**. The evidence is clear:

1. The Gt constraint implementation shows the correct pattern with an `else:` clause
2. The other constraints (Ge/Lt/Le/MultipleOf) are missing this `else:` clause
3. This causes unnecessary double validation for these constraints
4. The inconsistency appears to be an implementation oversight
5. The fix is trivial and improves both performance and code consistency

While the module is experimental, this doesn't excuse obvious implementation inconsistencies. The bug doesn't break functionality but does cause unnecessary performance overhead and violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
