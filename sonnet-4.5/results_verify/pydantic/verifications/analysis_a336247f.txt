BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating Possible Categories
------------------------------

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
-----------------------
Strong evidence for BUG:
1. Clear inconsistency between Gt and other similar constraints (Ge, Lt, Le)
2. Performance impact - constraints are validated twice unnecessarily
3. Code pattern clearly shows missing else clauses
4. The Gt implementation demonstrates the correct pattern that others should follow
5. No documentation suggests double application is intended
6. The bug report includes accurate reproduction code and a reasonable fix

This appears to be a valid logic bug that should be fixed.

INVALID
--------
Reasons it might be INVALID:
- None identified. The bug is real and reproducible.

The code clearly shows that Gt has an else clause while Ge, Lt, Le, Len, and MultipleOf do not. This is not a matter of interpretation or undefined behavior.

WONTFIX
--------
Reasons it might be WONTFIX:
1. The module is marked as experimental and "subject to change"
2. The performance impact might be considered negligible
3. The double validation doesn't cause incorrect behavior (just inefficiency)

However, given that:
- The fix is trivial (adding else clauses)
- It improves consistency and performance
- The bug report provides the exact fix

This is unlikely to be marked WONTFIX.

DOCUMENTATION_FIX
------------------
Reasons it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- If the double application was actually intended, then documentation should explain it

However:
- The code pattern with Gt clearly shows single application is intended
- No reasonable explanation for why some constraints would be applied twice
- The inconsistency suggests a bug, not a documentation issue

FEATURE_REQUEST
----------------
Reasons it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
- None identified. This is fixing existing broken behavior, not adding new functionality.

Final Assessment
----------------
This is a clear BUG that should be fixed:

1. The inconsistency between Gt (correct) and Ge/Lt/Le/Len/MultipleOf (buggy) is undeniable
2. The missing else clauses are obvious when comparing the implementations
3. The double application serves no purpose and only adds overhead
4. The fix is simple and non-breaking
5. The bug report is well-documented with accurate reproduction steps

The evidence overwhelmingly supports categorizing this as a valid BUG report that should be addressed.
