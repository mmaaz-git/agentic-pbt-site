DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Documentation Findings

### 1. Official Pydantic Documentation

The official Pydantic documentation describes the experimental pipeline API as follows:
- It is clearly marked as "EXPERIMENTAL" and "subject to change or removal"
- The documentation shows various constraint methods including `gt()`, `lt()`, `ge()`, `le()`
- The documentation demonstrates the use of `|` (or) and `&` (and) operators for combining pipelines

### 2. Implementation Analysis

From examining the actual source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/experimental/pipeline.py`:

**Methods Present:**
- Lines 267-269: `eq(self, value)` - Returns `_Pipeline` object
- Lines 271-273: `not_eq(self, value)` - Returns `_Pipeline` object
- Line 330: `__or__` is aliased to `otherwise` method (for pipeline combination)
- Line 336: `__and__` is aliased to `then` method (for pipeline chaining)

**Methods Absent:**
- No `__eq__` method defined
- No `__ne__` method defined

### 3. Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Current Behavior:**
- `pipeline.eq(5)` returns a `_Pipeline` object (constraint addition)
- `pipeline == 5` uses Python's default equality comparison, returns `bool`
- `pipeline.not_eq(5)` returns a `_Pipeline` object (constraint addition)
- `pipeline != 5` uses Python's default inequality comparison, returns `bool`

**Documentation Gap:**
The documentation does not explicitly state:
1. Whether `==` and `!=` operators should behave like `eq()` and `not_eq()`
2. That these operators are intentionally left as default Python comparisons
3. Any design rationale for this difference in behavior

### 4. Design Pattern Analysis

Looking at the existing operator overloads:
- `__or__` (line 330) is overloaded to perform pipeline combination (`.otherwise()`)
- `__and__` (line 336) is overloaded to perform pipeline chaining (`.then()`)

This shows that the Pipeline class does override operators to provide fluent API functionality, making it reasonable to expect `==` and `!=` might also be overridden for consistency.

### 5. Experimental Status

The module header (line 1) explicitly states:
"Experimental pipeline API functionality. Be careful with this API, it's subject to change."

The warning at line 7 of `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/experimental/__init__.py`:
"PydanticExperimentalWarning: This module is experimental, its contents are subject to change and deprecation."

### Conclusion

The documentation does not specify the expected behavior of `==` and `!=` operators on Pipeline objects. The API is experimental and the current inconsistency between method and operator behavior is not documented as intentional. Given that other operators (`|` and `&`) are overloaded for pipeline operations, the lack of overloading for `==` and `!=` appears to be an oversight rather than a deliberate design choice.
