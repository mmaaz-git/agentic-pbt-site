REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The hypothesis test fails as expected, and the reproduction example shows the reported behavior.

Key findings from reproduction:

1. The hypothesis test correctly identifies that Ge and Gt produce different schema types:
   - Ge(5) produces: {'type': 'function-after', ...}
   - Gt(5) produces: {'type': 'int', 'gt': 5}

2. The reproduction example confirms the inconsistency:
   - Ge(5) returns a 'function-after' schema type
   - Gt(5) returns a direct 'int' schema type

3. Additional discovery: The bug report is partially incorrect about which constraints have the issue:
   - Gt: Correctly uses else branch - produces direct schema when possible ✓
   - Ge: Always adds validator - produces function-after wrapper ✗
   - Lt: Always adds validator - produces function-after wrapper ✗ (report incorrectly says this works)
   - Le: Always adds validator - produces function-after wrapper ✗ (report incorrectly says this works)

The effect of this bug:
- Creates unnecessarily complex schemas by wrapping them with 'function-after' validators
- Adds runtime overhead for validation that could be handled directly by the schema
- Creates inconsistent behavior between Gt and the other three constraints (Ge, Lt, Le)
- The inner schema correctly has the constraint set (e.g., 'ge': 5), but it's still wrapped unnecessarily

The bug is real and affects performance and schema complexity, though the report incorrectly identifies which constraints are affected (it's not just Ge, but also Lt and Le).
