## Documentation Analysis for load_str_bytes

### Function Signature
The function `load_str_bytes` in `pydantic.deprecated.parse` has the following signature:
```python
def load_str_bytes(
    b: str | bytes,
    *,
    content_type: str | None = None,
    encoding: str = 'utf8',
    proto: Protocol | None = None,
    allow_pickle: bool = False,
    json_loads: Callable[[str], Any] = json.loads,
) -> Any
```

### Documentation Findings

1. **No explicit documentation**: The function has no docstring and is marked as deprecated with a warning.

2. **Function is deprecated**: The function is decorated with `@deprecated` and issues deprecation warnings, indicating it's part of pydantic's deprecated API.

3. **Encoding parameter behavior from code analysis**:
   - The `encoding` parameter has a default value of 'utf8'
   - For JSON protocol: The encoding IS used when converting bytes to string (line 48: `b.decode(encoding)`)
   - For Pickle protocol: The encoding is IGNORED when converting string to bytes (line 53: `b.encode()` without parameters)

4. **Consistency expectation**:
   - The function accepts both `str` and `bytes` as input for both protocols
   - It has an `encoding` parameter that users would reasonably expect to control the encoding/decoding between strings and bytes
   - For JSON, the encoding parameter works as expected for bytes->string conversion
   - For Pickle, the encoding parameter is ignored for string->bytes conversion

5. **Parallel implementation in v1**:
   - The pydantic.v1.parse module has the same function with identical behavior
   - This suggests the bug has existed since v1 and was carried forward to the deprecated module

### Implicit Contract
While not explicitly documented, the presence of an `encoding` parameter with a default value strongly implies that:
1. When bytes need to be decoded to strings, the encoding parameter should be used
2. When strings need to be encoded to bytes, the encoding parameter should be used
3. The behavior should be consistent across protocols

The current implementation violates this implicit contract for the pickle protocol.
