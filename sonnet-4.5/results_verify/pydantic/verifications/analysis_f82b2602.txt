TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - There is a clear inconsistency in the implementation between Gt and Ge/Lt/Le constraints
   - The code for Gt uses an else branch to conditionally apply validators, while Ge/Lt/Le always apply them
   - This creates unnecessary performance overhead with function-after wrappers
   - The inconsistency appears unintentional - no logical reason for different behavior
   - Creates more complex schemas than necessary, affecting runtime validation performance

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The module is marked as experimental and subject to change
   - The bug report incorrectly identifies which constraints are affected (says only Ge, but Lt/Le also affected)

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - The bug report is partially incorrect about which constraints have the issue
   - Claims Lt and Le work like Gt, but they actually have the same issue as Ge

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The core issue (inconsistency and unnecessary complexity) is real and reproducible
   - The hypothesis test correctly identifies the problem
   - The fix would improve performance and consistency

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - The module is experimental and might be redesigned anyway
   - The functional behavior is correct (constraints work), just suboptimal
   - Performance impact might be considered negligible

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - This is a clear code quality and performance issue
   - The fix is simple and improves consistency
   - Affects all users of these constraints

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - Could argue that "optimized constraint application" is a feature request

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - This is fixing an inconsistency in existing code, not adding new functionality
   - One constraint (Gt) already implements the optimized behavior

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - No documentation specifies the expected behavior

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The issue is in the code implementation, not documentation
   - Documentation doesn't claim any specific schema structure

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
=================
This should be categorized as BUG because:

1. There is a clear, unintentional inconsistency in the code
2. The Gt constraint demonstrates the correct pattern (conditional validator application)
3. The other constraints (Ge, Lt, Le) follow a different, suboptimal pattern
4. The fix is straightforward and improves both consistency and performance
5. While the module is experimental, this is still a quality issue worth fixing
6. The functional behavior is correct, but the implementation is unnecessarily inefficient

The fact that the bug report incorrectly identifies which constraints are affected (claiming Lt/Le work correctly when they don't) doesn't invalidate the core issue. The report correctly identifies a real problem with unnecessary schema complexity and inconsistent implementation patterns.
