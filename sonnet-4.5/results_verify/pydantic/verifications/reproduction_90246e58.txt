## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in pydantic.plugin._schema_validator.build_wrapper.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test ran and failed as expected, confirming that when an on_exception handler raises an exception, it suppresses the original exception. The test failed with:
- AssertionError: "Original exception was suppressed by handler exception"
- This occurred for ALL tested inputs (empty strings and other values)

### Direct Reproduction Results
The direct reproduction code also confirmed the bug:
- When func() raises ValueError("Original error")
- And the on_exception handler raises RuntimeError("Handler raised an exception")
- The code catches RuntimeError instead of the original ValueError
- Output: "BUG: Caught RuntimeError from handler: Handler raised an exception"
- This confirms the original ValueError was completely suppressed

### Code Analysis
Looking at the build_wrapper function (lines 95-124), the issue is clear:
- Line 116-117: When an exception (non-ValidationError) occurs, on_exception handlers are called
- If any on_exception_handler raises an exception, it immediately propagates up
- The original exception from line 110 is lost completely
- This breaks the chain of exception handling

### Impact Assessment
The bug is real and has significant consequences:
1. Original exceptions from application code are completely lost
2. Debugging becomes extremely difficult as users see handler exceptions instead of actual errors
3. A single buggy plugin can break the entire exception handling chain
4. The stack trace points to the wrong location (the handler instead of the original error)

This is indeed a valid bug that breaks the principle that plugin handlers should be observational and not interfere with the application's exception flow.
