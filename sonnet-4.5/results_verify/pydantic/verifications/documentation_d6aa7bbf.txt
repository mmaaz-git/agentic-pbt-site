## Documentation Analysis for pydantic.alias_generators

After reviewing the available documentation and source code for the pydantic.alias_generators module, here are my findings:

### Function Documentation

**to_pascal(snake: str) -> str:**
- Documentation: "Convert a snake_case string to PascalCase."
- Input: "The string to convert" (named 'snake' but not restricted to snake_case)
- Output: "The PascalCase string"

**to_snake(camel: str) -> str:**
- Documentation: "Convert a PascalCase, camelCase, or kebab-case string to snake_case."
- Input: "The string to convert" (named 'camel' but accepts multiple formats)
- Output: "The converted string in snake_case"

### Key Observations

1. **No Round-Trip Guarantee**: The documentation does NOT specify that these functions should round-trip. There is no mention that converting from snake_case to PascalCase and back should preserve the original format.

2. **Input Format Flexibility**: While to_pascal's parameter is named 'snake', the documentation doesn't strictly require snake_case input. Similarly, to_snake accepts multiple formats (PascalCase, camelCase, or kebab-case).

3. **No Number Handling Specification**: The documentation does not specify how numbers should be handled in conversions. There's no mention of whether 'field1' and 'field_1' are considered equivalent or different.

4. **Implementation Details**: The source code shows that to_snake() explicitly adds underscores between lowercase letters and digits (line 59), which is an implementation choice not documented in the public API.

5. **TODO Comment**: There's a TODO comment in the source (lines 7-9) suggesting the developers are aware the naming and functionality might need clarification in future versions.

6. **Primary Use Case**: The module is primarily designed for use as alias generators in Pydantic models, where the typical flow is from Python snake_case field names to external formats (camelCase/PascalCase) for serialization, not necessarily for perfect round-trip conversion.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not promise or imply that these functions should provide perfect round-trip conversion. The behavior with numbers inserting underscores is an implementation detail that is not addressed in the documentation either way.
