## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments For:**
- The function crashes with a common input type (bytes with non-UTF-8 data)
- No documentation states bytes must be valid UTF-8
- The crash is unexpected - a serializer should handle or reject inputs gracefully
- The function accepts bytes as a valid type but fails on certain byte values

**Arguments Against:**
- The function is deprecated and will be removed in V3.0
- JSON fundamentally requires UTF-8 text, not arbitrary binary data
- Python's standard json module doesn't even accept bytes objects

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- The function is deprecated since V2.0
- Users are directed to use `pydantic_core.to_jsonable_python` instead
- Fixing deprecated code that will be removed is low priority
- The issue only affects edge cases with non-text binary data

**Arguments Against:**
- The function is still present in the codebase and users may still use it
- The error is not graceful - it crashes rather than providing helpful feedback
- The deprecation period means it should still work correctly

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- JSON specification requires UTF-8 strings, not arbitrary bytes
- It's reasonable to assume bytes passed for JSON serialization contain text
- Python's json.dumps() doesn't accept bytes at all - more restrictive
- The encoder's purpose is JSON serialization, which inherently requires text

**Arguments Against:**
- The function explicitly handles bytes type, suggesting it should work
- No documentation states the UTF-8 requirement
- The error is confusing and unhelpful

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Supporting arbitrary binary data in JSON is a new capability
- Base64 encoding for binary data would be a feature addition
- The current behavior might be considered "working as designed" for text bytes

**Arguments Against:**
- The function already attempts to handle bytes
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The encoder already has a bytes handler that just doesn't work correctly

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The main issue is unclear expectations about bytes handling
- Documentation could specify that bytes must contain valid UTF-8
- Users need guidance on handling binary data (use base64, etc.)
- The error message could be more informative

**Arguments Against:**
- The code is actually broken - it crashes on valid input
- Documentation alone won't prevent the crashes
- This is deprecated code, so extensive documentation updates seem wasteful

### Final Analysis
The key factors are:
1. The function is deprecated and scheduled for removal
2. JSON inherently works with text, not binary data
3. The crash occurs on inputs that arguably shouldn't be JSON-serializable
4. However, the function does attempt to handle bytes and fails ungracefully

This is most appropriately a WONTFIX because:
- The function is deprecated with a clear migration path
- Fixing deprecated code is low priority
- The use case (binary data in JSON) is questionable
- Resources are better spent on the replacement function
