DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:
The official Pydantic documentation for plugins states:
- PYDANTIC_DISABLE_PLUGINS can be set to '__all__', '1', or 'true' to disable all plugins
- It can be set to a comma-separated string of plugin names to disable specific plugins
- Example given: PYDANTIC_DISABLE_PLUGINS=my-plugin-1,my-plugin2

CRITICAL OBSERVATION: The example shown uses NO SPACES after the comma.

2. FORMAT SPECIFICATION:
The documentation does NOT explicitly specify:
- Whether spaces after commas are allowed
- Whether spaces should be stripped
- The exact parsing behavior for the comma-separated list

3. PULL REQUEST ANALYSIS:
The original GitHub PR #8767 that introduced this feature does not provide explicit formatting specifications for the comma-separated list format. It only mentions the ability to "disable all or specified plugins."

4. COMMON CONVENTIONS:
- In most comma-separated list contexts (CSV files, command-line arguments, configuration files), spaces after commas are either:
  a) Automatically stripped/ignored
  b) Explicitly documented as not allowed
- Users commonly write comma-separated lists with spaces for readability: "item1, item2, item3"
- The Python convention for parsing such lists typically involves stripping whitespace

5. USER EXPECTATION:
Based on common usage patterns:
- Users naturally write: "plugin1, plugin2, plugin3" (with spaces for readability)
- The documentation example shows: "my-plugin-1,my-plugin2" (no spaces)
- This creates ambiguity about the expected format

6. IMPLICATIONS:
The lack of explicit documentation about whitespace handling means:
- The current behavior (not stripping whitespace) is technically not wrong per the documentation
- However, it violates common user expectations and conventions
- The documentation example (without spaces) could be interpreted as either:
  a) A requirement (no spaces allowed)
  b) Just one valid format among others

CONCLUSION:
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that spaces should be stripped, it also doesn't state they shouldn't be. The example provided uses no spaces, but this could be seen as insufficient documentation rather than a specification. The lack of clarity suggests this is either a documentation issue or a usability bug in the implementation.
