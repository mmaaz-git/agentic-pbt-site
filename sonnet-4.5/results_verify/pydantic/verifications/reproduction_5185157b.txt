Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction
--------------------------------
The hypothesis test provided in the bug report runs and fails exactly as described:
- The test generates snake_case strings matching the pattern: ^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$
- It attempts to round-trip them through to_pascal() and then to_snake()
- The test fails on the input 'a_a' with:
  AssertionError: Round-trip failed: a_a -> AA -> aa

2. Manual Test Case Reproduction
---------------------------------
All three manual test cases from the bug report fail as described:
- 'a_a' -> 'AA' -> 'aa' (expected 'a_a')
- 'a_b_c' -> 'ABC' -> 'abc' (expected 'a_b_c')
- 'x_y' -> 'XY' -> 'xy' (expected 'x_y')

3. Root Cause Analysis
----------------------
The issue occurs because:
a) to_pascal('a_a') correctly converts to 'AA' (consecutive uppercase letters)
b) to_snake('AA') fails to recognize this as needing underscores between the letters
c) The regex patterns in to_snake() only insert underscores when:
   - An uppercase letter is followed by a lowercase letter
   - A lowercase letter is followed by an uppercase letter
   - But NOT when an uppercase letter is followed by another uppercase letter

4. Additional Test Results
--------------------------
Testing various cases revealed that the round-trip works correctly for:
- Standard multi-letter snake_case (e.g., 'hello_world', 'xml_parser')
- Mixed cases like 'get_xml_parser'
- Single words and single letters

But fails for:
- Snake_case with single-letter segments separated by underscores ('a_a', 'a_b_c', 'x_y')

The reverse direction (PascalCase -> snake -> Pascal) also fails for:
- Consecutive uppercase letters ('XMLParser' -> 'xml_parser' -> 'XmlParser')
- All uppercase abbreviations ('ABC' -> 'abc' -> 'Abc')

Conclusion: The bug is real and reproducible. The functions fail to round-trip correctly for valid inputs containing single-letter segments in snake_case.
