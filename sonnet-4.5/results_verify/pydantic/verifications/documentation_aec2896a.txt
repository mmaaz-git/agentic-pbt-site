## Documentation Analysis for Base64Bytes

### Official Pydantic Documentation

According to the official Pydantic documentation:
- `Base64Bytes` is a bytes type that is encoded and decoded using standard base64
- It's supposed to validate base64-encoded data
- The documentation states it "raises validation errors for incorrectly encoded input"
- It should provide "clear error messages for decoding failures"

### Expected Behavior per Documentation

The documentation explicitly states that Base64Bytes should:
1. Accept valid base64-encoded bytes/strings
2. Raise `ValidationError` for invalid base64 input
3. Provide robust validation for base64-encoded byte values

### Python's base64.b64decode Behavior

The underlying Python function `base64.b64decode` has a `validate` parameter:
- When `validate=False` (default): Non-base64 characters are **silently discarded** before padding check
- When `validate=True`: Non-base64 characters cause a `binascii.Error`

### The Critical Issue

Pydantic is using `base64.b64decode` with the default `validate=False`. This means:
- Invalid bytes like `b'\x00'` are silently discarded rather than causing an error
- After discarding all non-base64 characters, the result can be empty bytes
- This behavior contradicts the documented promise of "raising validation errors for incorrectly encoded input"

### GitHub Issue #12047

There's an open GitHub issue (#12047) about this exact problem:
- Filed as a bug for Pydantic V2
- A maintainer acknowledged it as "reasonable"
- Tagged for consideration in V3
- The issue confirms that Base64Bytes doesn't properly validate bytes

### Documentation vs Implementation Gap

The documentation promises validation errors for invalid input, but the implementation silently accepts and corrupts invalid data. This is a clear discrepancy between:
- **What the docs say**: "Raises validation errors for incorrectly encoded input"
- **What actually happens**: Invalid input is silently converted to empty bytes

The documentation does NOT say that invalid bytes will be silently discarded or that data loss is acceptable. Users reading the documentation would reasonably expect validation errors for invalid input, not silent data loss.
