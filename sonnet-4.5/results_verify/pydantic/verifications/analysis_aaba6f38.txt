TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report for each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (incorrect report):
   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation never promises round-trip invariance for models
   - exclude=True is documented to exclude fields from serialization
   - The behavior matches the documented purpose (fields are excluded)
   - There's no documented expectation that excluded fields should survive serialization

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The user's expectation is reasonable for internal serialization use cases
   - Other serialization libraries often preserve round-trip behavior
   - The behavior is surprising and could lead to data loss

2. WONTFIX (trivial/uninteresting):
   Arguments FOR:
   - This is an edge case - most users don't expect excluded fields to round-trip
   - Workarounds exist (don't use exclude=True for fields that need persistence)
   - The primary use case (excluding from external APIs) works correctly

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This affects a core serialization pattern
   - The issue can cause real data loss in production systems
   - Multiple users would benefit from a fix

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (new functionality):
   Arguments FOR:
   - Round-trip preservation for excluded fields is a new capability, not a bug fix
   - The suggested solutions (mode='internal', etc.) are new features
   - Current behavior matches documented behavior; user wants additional behavior
   - No existing promise of this functionality

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Could be seen as fixing incomplete functionality rather than adding new
   - Basic expectation that data shouldn't be lost

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (docs are wrong):
   Arguments FOR:
   - Documentation should warn users that excluded fields don't round-trip
   - The limitation should be explicitly documented
   - Best practices for preserving private state should be documented

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation isn't technically wrong, just incomplete
   - The current behavior matches what's documented

5. BUG (valid bug):
   Arguments FOR:
   - Violates principle of least surprise
   - Breaks a common serialization pattern
   - Can cause unexpected data loss
   - model.model_copy() preserves these fields, creating inconsistency

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Behavior matches documentation
   - No documented promise of round-trip invariance
   - exclude=True is working as designed (excluding from serialization)

ASSESSMENT:
This is NOT a bug in the traditional sense because:
1. The code works exactly as documented
2. There's no documented promise of round-trip preservation
3. The exclude parameter's purpose is to exclude from serialization, which it does

The report describes a limitation or missing feature rather than incorrect behavior. The user wants excluded fields to be preserved through serialization for internal use cases, which is a reasonable request but not something Pydantic currently promises or implements.

RECOMMENDED CATEGORIZATION: FEATURE_REQUEST
The user is requesting new functionality to support round-trip serialization of excluded fields, possibly through a new mode parameter or separate method. This is a valid enhancement request but not a bug in the current implementation.
