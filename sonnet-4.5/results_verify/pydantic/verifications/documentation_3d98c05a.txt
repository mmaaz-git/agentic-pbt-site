## Documentation Analysis

### Pydantic Documentation
The official Pydantic documentation clearly states that PaymentCardNumber validation includes length validation based on card brand:
- **Mastercard**: Exactly 16 digits long
- **Visa**: 13, 16, or 19 digits long
- **American Express**: Exactly 15 digits long
- **Other brands**: No specific length requirement

The documentation indicates that validation is "Based on BIN (Bank Identification Number) for major brands" and that an error should be raised if the length doesn't match the expected range for each brand.

### Wikipedia Reference (Payment Card Number Standards)
The code specifically references Wikipedia's Payment card number article for the Issuer Identification Number (IIN) section. According to this authoritative source:
- **Mastercard**: 16 digits (with IIN ranges 2221-2720 and 51-55)
- **Visa**: 13, 16, or 19 digits (prefix 4)
- **American Express**: 15 digits (IIN ranges 34 and 37)

### Code Intent vs Implementation
The code clearly intends to enforce these length requirements as evidenced by:
1. The docstring explicitly references the Wikipedia article for validation rules
2. The method name `validate_length_for_brand` clearly indicates its purpose
3. The method correctly implements length validation for Visa (line 1046-1048) and Amex (line 1049-1051) using `==` operator
4. The method attempts to validate Mastercard length, setting `required_length = 16` (line 1044)

### Conclusion
Both the Pydantic documentation and the external Wikipedia reference confirm that Mastercard cards must be exactly 16 digits. The code's intent is clear from its structure and comments - it should enforce this 16-digit requirement for Mastercard. The bug prevents this documented behavior from working correctly, allowing Mastercard numbers of any length between 12-19 digits to pass validation when they should be rejected.
