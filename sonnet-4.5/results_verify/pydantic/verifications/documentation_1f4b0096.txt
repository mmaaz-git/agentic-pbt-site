DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. OFFICIAL PYDANTIC v1.10 DOCUMENTATION ON exclude_defaults:

   From the Pydantic v1 documentation for BaseModel.dict():
   - Parameter: exclude_defaults (bool)
   - Definition: "whether fields which are equal to their default values (whether set or otherwise) should be excluded from the returned dictionary; default False"
   - Note: Prior to v1.0, exclude_defaults was known as skip_defaults

2. DOCUMENTATION ON default_factory:

   From Field documentation:
   - default_factory: "A zero-argument callable that will be called when a default value is needed for this field"
   - Purpose: "Among other purposes, this can be used to set dynamic default values"
   - Constraint: "It is forbidden to set both default and default_factory"

3. KEY DOCUMENTATION FINDING:

   The documentation states that exclude_defaults should exclude fields that are "equal to their default values (whether set or otherwise)". This clearly indicates that:
   - ANY field equal to its default should be excluded
   - The phrase "whether set or otherwise" implies this should work regardless of HOW the default was defined
   - There is NO documented exception for default_factory fields

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR BASED ON DOCUMENTATION:

   Based on the documentation, fields with default_factory should be treated the same as fields with regular defaults when:
   - The field value equals the value that would be generated by the default_factory
   - exclude_defaults=True is specified

5. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:

   - The documentation does not explicitly state how default_factory fields interact with exclude_defaults
   - However, the general definition of exclude_defaults is clear: exclude fields equal to their defaults
   - There is no documented reason why default_factory fields should be treated differently

6. RELATED ISSUES IN PYDANTIC HISTORY:

   - There were known issues in Pydantic v1 with dynamic defaults and exclude_unset/exclude_defaults
   - GitHub Issue #1399 documented similar inconsistencies with validator-set defaults
   - These issues suggest this was a known area of inconsistent behavior in v1

CONCLUSION:
The documentation clearly states that exclude_defaults should exclude ALL fields equal to their default values. The current behavior where default_factory fields are NOT excluded violates the documented contract of exclude_defaults. The documentation does not provide any exception or special case for default_factory fields, so they should be treated consistently with regular defaults.
