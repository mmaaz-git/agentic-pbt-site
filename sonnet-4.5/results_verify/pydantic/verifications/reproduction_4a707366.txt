# Reproduction Results

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pydantic.deprecated.json.timedelta_isoformat for negative timedeltas.

## Test Results

### Direct Reproduction
Running the provided reproduction code confirms the issue:
- Input: `datetime.timedelta(seconds=-1)`
- Output from timedelta_isoformat: `-P1DT23H59M59.000000S`
- Parsed back: `-2 days, 0:00:01` (total_seconds=-172799.0)
- Expected: `-1 second` (total_seconds=-1.0)

The round-trip fails completely - instead of getting back -1 second, we get -172799 seconds (approximately -48 hours).

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis-based property test failed on all three provided examples:
1. `timedelta(seconds=-1)` -> `-P1DT23H59M59.000000S` -> `-2 days, 0:00:01`
2. `timedelta(seconds=-30)` -> `-P1DT23H59M30.000000S` -> `-2 days, 0:00:30`
3. `timedelta(hours=-1)` -> `-P1DT23H0M0.000000S` -> `-2 days, 1:00:00`

All cases show the same pattern of incorrect encoding.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from how Python internally represents negative timedeltas:
- `timedelta(seconds=-1)` is stored as `days=-1, seconds=86399, microseconds=0`
- This is because Python normalizes the representation to have positive seconds/microseconds

The current implementation in timedelta_isoformat (lines 139-141) incorrectly handles this:
```python
minutes, seconds = divmod(td.seconds, 60)
hours, minutes = divmod(minutes, 60)
return f'{"-" if td.days < 0 else ""}P{abs(td.days)}DT{hours:d}H{minutes:d}M{seconds:d}.{td.microseconds:06d}S'
```

It uses `td.seconds` directly (which is 86399 for -1 second) and only checks `td.days` for the sign. This creates `-P1DT23H59M59.000000S` which according to ISO 8601 means "minus (1 day + 23 hours + 59 minutes + 59 seconds)" = -172799 seconds.

## Expected Behavior
The correct ISO 8601 format for `timedelta(seconds=-1)` should be `-PT1S`, which the isodate library correctly parses back to -1 second.

## Impact
This bug affects any code that:
1. Serializes negative timedeltas using this deprecated function
2. Expects the serialized format to be correctly parseable back to the original value
3. Uses the output for interoperability with other systems expecting valid ISO 8601 durations

The function is marked as deprecated, but it still claims to produce "ISO 8601 encoding for Python timedelta object" which it fails to do correctly for negative values.
