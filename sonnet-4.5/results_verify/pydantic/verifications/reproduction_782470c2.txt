REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in pydantic.plugin._loader.get_plugins().

1. CODE EXAMINATION:
I examined the actual pydantic code at line 45 of _loader.py:
```python
if disabled_plugins is not None and entry_point.name in disabled_plugins.split(','):
```

This code splits the PYDANTIC_DISABLE_PLUGINS environment variable by commas but does NOT strip whitespace from the resulting strings.

2. BUG REPRODUCTION:
The bug was successfully reproduced using the example provided:
- Input: PYDANTIC_DISABLE_PLUGINS='myplugin, yourplugin, theirplugin'
- After split(','): ['myplugin', ' yourplugin', ' theirplugin']
- Result: Only 'myplugin' would be disabled, NOT 'yourplugin' or 'theirplugin'

3. EFFECT OF THE BUG:
When users naturally write comma-separated lists with spaces after commas (which is standard formatting), the plugin disabling mechanism fails for all plugins except the first one. This is because:
- Entry point names are 'yourplugin' (no space)
- Split result contains ' yourplugin' (with leading space)
- String comparison fails: 'yourplugin' != ' yourplugin'

4. VERIFICATION:
The hypothesis test provided in the bug report demonstrates this issue across various input combinations. The core issue is consistently reproduced: whitespace after commas prevents proper plugin name matching.

5. PROPOSED FIX VALIDITY:
The proposed fix to use `name.strip() for name in disabled_plugins.split(',')` would resolve this issue by removing leading/trailing whitespace from each plugin name after splitting.

CONCLUSION: The bug is real, reproducible, and affects the intended functionality of the PYDANTIC_DISABLE_PLUGINS feature.
