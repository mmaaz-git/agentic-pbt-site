DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

Official Pydantic Documentation:
--------------------------------
According to the official Pydantic documentation at https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.8/concepts/plugins/, the PYDANTIC_DISABLE_PLUGINS environment variable is documented with the following behavior:

Allowed Values and Their Documented Behavior:
- `__all__`, `1`, `true`: Disables all plugins
- Comma-separated string: Disables specified plugin(s)

Key Documentation Points:
1. The documentation explicitly lists '__all__' as a valid value for disabling all plugins
2. The documentation shows that comma-separated strings can be used to disable specific plugins
3. The documentation does NOT explicitly state how '__all__' should behave when it appears within a comma-separated list

Documentation Gap:
-----------------
The documentation doesn't specify whether '__all__' retains its special meaning when appearing in a comma-separated list. This creates ambiguity:
- Should '__all__,plugin1' disable all plugins (treating __all__ as special)?
- Or should it disable plugins named '__all__' and 'plugin1' (treating __all__ as literal)?

User Expectation vs Current Implementation:
-------------------------------------------
Given that '__all__' is documented as a special keyword to disable all plugins, users would reasonably expect it to maintain this special meaning even when part of a comma-separated list. The principle of least surprise suggests that special keywords should retain their special meaning in all contexts.

The current implementation only treats '__all__' as special when it's the complete value, not when it's part of a list. This is not explicitly documented, creating a documentation gap that leads to unexpected behavior.
