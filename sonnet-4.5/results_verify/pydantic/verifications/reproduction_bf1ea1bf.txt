## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Technical Accuracy of the Bug Report
The bug report is TECHNICALLY ACCURATE in its claims:

1. **Schema Structure Difference - CONFIRMED**:
   - Gt constraint generates: `{'gt': 5, 'type': 'int'}` (no validator function)
   - Ge constraint generates: A function-after wrapper with `{'ge': 5, 'type': 'int'}` inside
   - Lt and Le behave like Ge (with extra validators)

2. **Code Analysis - CONFIRMED**:
   - Lines 448-463: Gt has an `else` clause that only adds validator function when NOT int/float/decimal
   - Lines 464-478: Ge lacks the `else` clause, so validator function is ALWAYS added
   - Lines 479-493: Lt has same issue (no else clause)
   - Lines 494-508: Le has same issue (no else clause)

3. **Functional Correctness - VERIFIED**:
   - All constraints (Gt, Ge, Lt, Le) validate correctly
   - Test cases show all constraints properly accept/reject values as expected
   - The validation logic works, it's just done differently

### Performance Impact
Testing shows measurable but small performance difference:
- Valid values: Ge is ~16% slower than Gt (double validation overhead)
- Invalid values: Minimal difference (~0% slower)
- Impact exists but is relatively minor for most use cases

### Key Observations
1. The inconsistency is real - Gt uses one approach, Ge/Lt/Le use another
2. Both approaches produce correct validation results
3. The double validation in Ge/Lt/Le is inefficient but not incorrect
4. This is internal implementation detail not visible to users except via:
   - Examining internal schema structure (advanced use case)
   - Minor performance difference
   - Different error message paths (both still correct)

### Bug Report Claims vs Reality
- **Claim**: "Double validation" - TRUE (validator is applied twice)
- **Claim**: "Inconsistent with Gt" - TRUE (different implementation pattern)
- **Claim**: "Bug" - DEBATABLE (inefficiency vs incorrectness)
- **Functional Impact**: NONE (validation works correctly in all cases)
