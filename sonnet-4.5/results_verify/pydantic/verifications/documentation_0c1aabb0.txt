## Documentation Analysis for timedelta_isoformat

### Function Documentation
The function `timedelta_isoformat` has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "ISO 8601 encoding for Python timedelta object."
- The function is marked as deprecated with a warning
- No specific documentation about how negative timedeltas should be handled

### Pydantic Context
1. The function is in `pydantic.deprecated.json` module, indicating it's deprecated functionality
2. In Pydantic v2, the modern approach uses `ConfigDict(ser_json_timedelta='iso8601')` instead
3. The function was originally provided as an optional alternative for ISO 8601 time diff encoding in v1

### ISO 8601 Duration Standard
According to ISO 8601:
1. **Negative durations**: Should be represented with a minus sign before the 'P', e.g., `-P1D`
2. **Format meaning**: `-P1DT0H0M0.000001S` means "negative (1 day + 0 hours + 0 minutes + 0.000001 seconds)"
3. **All components positive**: When using a negative prefix, all time scale components within the duration should be positive
4. **Interpretation**: `-P1DT0H0M0.000001S` = -(86400 + 0.000001) = -86400.000001 seconds

### Key Finding
The ISO 8601 standard is clear that when a negative sign precedes the P, it applies to the entire duration as a sum of positive components. The current implementation incorrectly handles Python's internal normalization of negative timedeltas.

### Python timedelta Behavior
Python normalizes timedeltas so that:
- `days` can be negative
- `seconds` is always in range [0, 86399]
- `microseconds` is always in range [0, 999999]

For example, `timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)` is stored internally as:
- days=-1
- seconds=0
- microseconds=1
- Total: -86399.999999 seconds

### Documentation Gap
The function documentation does not specify:
1. How negative timedeltas are handled
2. That the function has known issues with negative durations
3. That users should use the modern `ser_json_timedelta` config instead

The lack of documentation about negative timedelta handling combined with the incorrect implementation constitutes a valid bug.
