## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results
I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report:

1. **Specific failing input (b'\x80')**: Confirmed - raises UnicodeDecodeError
2. **Valid UTF-8 bytes (b'hello')**: Works correctly, returns 'hello'
3. **Multiple invalid UTF-8 sequences**: All fail with UnicodeDecodeError
   - b'\xff': Failed
   - b'\x80\x80': Failed
   - b'\xc0\x80': Failed (overlong encoding)
   - b'\xed\xa0\x80': Failed (UTF-16 surrogate)
   - b'test\x80data': Failed (mixed valid/invalid)

4. **Common binary data use cases**: Mixed results
   - PNG file header (b'\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n'): Failed
   - JPEG file header (b'\xff\xd8\xff'): Failed
   - Some binary data worked if it happened to be valid UTF-8

### Technical Verification
The implementation at line 55 of `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/deprecated/json.py` shows:
```python
bytes: lambda o: o.decode()
```

This confirms the bug report's claim that the encoder calls `bytes.decode()` without any parameters, which:
- Defaults to UTF-8 encoding
- Uses strict error handling
- Raises UnicodeDecodeError on invalid UTF-8 sequences

### Error Message Accuracy
The error message reported matches exactly:
```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte
```

### Alternative Approaches Tested
I verified that alternative approaches would work:
- `decode('utf-8', errors='replace')` returns 'ï¿½' (replacement character)
- `decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')` returns '' (empty string)
- Base64 encoding returns 'gA=='
- Hex encoding returns '80'

### Hypothesis Test Note
While I couldn't run the full hypothesis test due to version issues, manual testing with various byte sequences confirmed the pattern: any bytes containing invalid UTF-8 sequences will cause the encoder to crash.

### Conclusion
The bug is 100% reproducible. The `pydantic_encoder` function crashes with UnicodeDecodeError when given bytes that contain invalid UTF-8 sequences, exactly as described in the bug report.
