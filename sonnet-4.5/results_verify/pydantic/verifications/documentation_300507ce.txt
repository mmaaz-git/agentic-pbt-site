## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `filter_handlers` function has inline documentation in the source code:
```python
def filter_handlers(handler_cls: BaseValidateHandlerProtocol, method_name: str) -> bool:
    """Filter out handler methods which are not implemented by the plugin directly - e.g. are missing
    or are inherited from the protocol.
    """
```

This indicates the function's purpose is to determine whether a handler method is actually implemented by a plugin or just inherited from the protocol base class.

### BaseValidateHandlerProtocol Requirements
From `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/plugin/__init__.py`:

1. Line 80 explicitly defines: `on_enter: Callable[..., None]`
2. This means `on_enter` MUST be a Callable that returns None
3. Similar requirements exist for other handler methods (on_success, on_error, on_exception)

The protocol clearly specifies that handler attributes like `on_enter`, `on_success`, `on_error`, and `on_exception` should be **callables**.

### Protocol Implementation Details
- `BaseValidateHandlerProtocol` is a Protocol base class (lines 73-106)
- It defines four methods: on_enter, on_success, on_error, on_exception
- Each method has specific type signatures and expectations
- The protocol states "You shouldn't implement this protocol directly, instead use one of the subclasses"

### Key Finding
The documentation and type hints clearly indicate that handler methods MUST be Callable objects. Setting these attributes to non-callable values (like integers, strings, lists, etc.) violates the protocol contract.

### Documentation Gaps
1. The `filter_handlers` function itself is internal (in _schema_validator.py with underscore prefix) and not part of the public API
2. There's no explicit documentation about what happens when protocol violations occur
3. The function doesn't document what it expects when handler attributes are incorrectly typed

### Conclusion
While the protocol clearly specifies that handler methods must be Callables, the `filter_handlers` function doesn't gracefully handle violations of this contract. When a handler attribute is set to a non-callable that lacks `__module__`, the function crashes instead of handling it robustly.
