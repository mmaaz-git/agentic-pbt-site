## Documentation Analysis

### Official Pydantic Documentation

From the official Pydantic documentation (https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.4/concepts/plugins/), I found the following relevant information:

1. **Plugin System Status**: The plugin system is currently marked as **experimental** and subject to change.

2. **Event Handler Callbacks**:
   - `on_error`: Called when field validation fails
   - The documentation shows that `on_error` receives a `ValidationError` as a parameter
   - Example implementations simply print the error

3. **Handler Protocol Documentation** (from `__init__.py`):
   - The `on_error` method in `BaseValidateHandlerProtocol` has the docstring:
     ```python
     def on_error(self, error: ValidationError) -> None:
         """Callback to be notified of validation errors.

         Args:
             error: The validation error.
         """
         return
     ```
   - Note that the return type is `None`, indicating handlers should not return values
   - The method is described as a "callback to be notified" - suggesting it's observational

4. **Handler Purpose**:
   - The documentation states handlers are for "notification" purposes
   - The protocol methods have default implementations that simply return
   - Nothing in the documentation suggests handlers should be able to affect control flow

### What the Documentation DOES NOT Say

Critically, the documentation does **not** specify:
1. What happens if an `on_error` handler raises an exception
2. Whether handlers are expected to be exception-safe
3. Whether the original ValidationError should be preserved if a handler fails
4. Whether handlers are meant to be purely observational or can affect validation flow

### Documentation Implications

The documentation strongly suggests that:
1. Handlers are meant for observation/notification ("callback to be notified")
2. Handlers should complete normally (return None)
3. The plugin system wraps validation methods but shouldn't change their fundamental behavior

However, since the behavior when handlers raise exceptions is **not explicitly documented**, this falls into undefined behavior territory. The reasonable expectation based on the naming and description ("on_error" callback for notification) is that these handlers should not suppress the original validation error.
