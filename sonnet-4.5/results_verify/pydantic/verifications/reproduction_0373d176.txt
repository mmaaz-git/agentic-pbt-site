BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

REPRODUCING THE REPORTED BUG:

The bug report claims that to_snake is not idempotent for the input 'A0'.

TEST RESULTS:
1. First application: to_snake('A0') = 'a0'
2. Second application: to_snake('a0') = 'a_0'

CONFIRMED: The bug report is technically correct - the function produces different results when applied twice.

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WHY THIS HAPPENS:

For input 'A0':
- First pass: Only converts to lowercase, resulting in 'a0'
  - No regex patterns match 'A0' (no lowercase-uppercase transitions, no sequences)
  - Only the final lowercase conversion applies

For input 'a0' (result of first pass):
- Second pass: Pattern ([a-z])([0-9]) matches and inserts underscore
  - The pattern 'lowercase letter followed by digit' matches
  - Transforms 'a0' to 'a_0'

ADDITIONAL TEST CASES:

Input 'AB0':
- First: 'AB0' -> 'ab0' (only lowercase conversion)
- Second: 'ab0' -> 'ab_0' (underscore insertion between letter and digit)
- Not idempotent

Input 'Ab0':
- First: 'Ab0' -> 'ab_0' (pattern matches on first pass because 'b' is lowercase)
- Second: 'ab_0' -> 'ab_0' (already has underscore, no change)
- Becomes idempotent after first application

Input 'HTTPResponse':
- First: 'HTTPResponse' -> 'http_response' (proper snake_case conversion)
- Second: 'http_response' -> 'http_response' (no change)
- Idempotent

PATTERN OBSERVED:
The function fails to be idempotent specifically when:
1. Input contains only uppercase letters followed by digits (like 'A0', 'AB0')
2. These get converted to lowercase without underscores on first pass
3. The lowercase-digit pattern then matches on second pass, adding underscores

The function DOES achieve stability after the second application - the third application produces the same result as the second.
