BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is real and affects all event handlers in the build_wrapper function.

## Test Results

All test cases from the bug report passed, confirming the described behavior:

1. **Test 1 - Handler Exception Masking**: When on_error handler raises RuntimeError, it completely masks the original ValidationError and prevents subsequent handlers from executing.
   - Expected: ValidationError should be raised after all handlers run
   - Actual: RuntimeError is raised, second handler never executes

2. **Test 2 - Reproduction Case**: Confirmed that a crashing plugin handler prevents other plugins from running.
   - Original ValidationError is replaced by RuntimeError from the handler
   - handler2.on_error was never called

3. **Test 3 - on_success Handler Exception**: When on_success handler raises an exception, the function's return value is lost.
   - Function correctly computed result (5 * 2 = 10)
   - Result never returned due to handler exception

4. **Test 4 - on_enter Handler Exception**: When on_enter handler raises an exception, the wrapped function never executes.
   - Original function was never called due to handler crash

## Code Analysis

The issue is in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/plugin/_schema_validator.py` lines 107-123.

The current implementation has no exception handling for the event handlers:

```python
for on_error_handler in on_errors:
    on_error_handler(error)  # If this raises, loop breaks and original error is lost
raise  # Never reached if handler raises
```

## Impact

This bug has serious consequences:
1. **Error Masking**: Original validation errors are completely hidden by plugin bugs
2. **Plugin Chain Breaking**: One faulty plugin prevents all subsequent plugins from running
3. **Silent Failures**: Users lose critical validation error information
4. **No Error Isolation**: No protection between independent plugins

The bug affects all four event handler types: on_enter, on_error, on_exception, and on_success.
