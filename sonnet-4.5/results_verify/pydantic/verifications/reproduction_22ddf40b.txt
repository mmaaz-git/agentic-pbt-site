REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced and verified the bug report. The issue is real and demonstrable.

## Bug Reproduction Steps Taken:

1. **Hypothesis Test Execution**:
   - Ran the provided Hypothesis test successfully
   - Test passes because functionality works correctly, but the issue is performance/efficiency

2. **Source Code Examination**:
   - Examined lines 448-548 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/experimental/pipeline.py`
   - Confirmed that Gt constraint (lines 448-463) has an `else:` clause before the validator function definition
   - Confirmed that Ge, Lt, Le, and MultipleOf constraints lack the `else:` clause

3. **Direct Testing of Constraint Application**:
   - Created test that directly calls `_apply_constraint` with different constraint types
   - Results clearly show the different behavior:
     * Gt constraint: Returns `{'type': 'int', 'gt': 10}` - only schema constraint
     * Ge constraint: Returns wrapped schema with BOTH 'ge' in nested schema AND validator function
     * Lt constraint: Returns wrapped schema with BOTH 'lt' in nested schema AND validator function
     * Le constraint: Returns wrapped schema with BOTH 'le' in nested schema AND validator function
     * MultipleOf: Returns wrapped schema with BOTH 'multiple_of' in nested schema AND validator function

## Effect of the Bug:

The bug causes double validation for Ge/Lt/Le/MultipleOf constraints:

1. First validation happens through the pydantic-core schema constraint (e.g., 'ge': 10)
2. Second validation happens through the validator function wrapper

This results in:
- Unnecessary performance overhead (each value is checked twice against the same constraint)
- Inconsistent implementation pattern within the same function
- Code that is harder to maintain due to inconsistency

The bug is FUNCTIONAL but INEFFICIENT - values are correctly validated, but the validation happens twice unnecessarily.
