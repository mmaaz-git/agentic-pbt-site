## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is demonstrably real - Ge, Lt, and Le do apply validation twice while Gt applies it once
- The code clearly shows missing else clauses that cause double validation
- The test case correctly identifies the inconsistency
- The performance impact is measurable (~13% slower)

**Verdict:** This is NOT an invalid bug report.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- The module is marked as experimental and subject to change
- The functional behavior is correct (validation works, just inefficiently)
- Performance impact is relatively small (13% in microbenchmark)

**Arguments Against:**
- This is a clear implementation inconsistency between related operators
- The fix is trivial (adding else clauses to match Gt implementation)
- Performance degradation accumulates in production systems
- Code consistency matters for maintainability
- The experimental nature doesn't excuse obvious bugs

**Verdict:** This should NOT be marked as WONTFIX.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments Against:**
- This is not requesting new functionality
- All four operators already exist and work functionally
- The issue is about fixing an implementation inconsistency, not adding features
- The expected behavior (consistent implementation) is reasonable without being a new feature

**Verdict:** This is NOT a feature request.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation correctly describes what the operators do functionally
- The issue is in the code implementation, not documentation
- Documentation doesn't need to specify internal implementation details
- No documentation suggests double validation is intentional

**Verdict:** This is NOT a documentation issue.

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments For:**
- Clear implementation inconsistency between Gt and Ge/Lt/Le operators
- Missing else clauses in the code are an obvious oversight
- Unnecessary performance overhead from double validation
- The fix is straightforward and matches the pattern already used in Gt
- All four comparison operators should have consistent internal implementations
- The bug report provides accurate reproduction steps and analysis
- The proposed fix is correct and minimal

**Arguments Against:**
- Module is experimental (but this doesn't excuse bugs)

**Verdict:** This IS a valid BUG.

### Final Analysis

This is a legitimate logic bug in the pydantic experimental pipeline module. The implementation inconsistency between Gt (which correctly uses an else clause to avoid double validation) and Ge/Lt/Le (which lack the else clause and thus perform double validation) is clearly unintentional. The bug report is well-documented, includes proper reproduction steps, correctly identifies the root cause, and provides an appropriate fix. While the module is experimental, this doesn't mean bugs should be ignored, especially when they have clear fixes that improve both performance and code consistency.
