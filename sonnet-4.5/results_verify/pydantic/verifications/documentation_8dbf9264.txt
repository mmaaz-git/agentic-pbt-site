## Documentation Analysis for timedelta_isoformat

### Function Documentation
The function `timedelta_isoformat` has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "ISO 8601 encoding for Python timedelta object."
- No specification about how negative durations should be handled
- No examples provided in the docstring

### ISO 8601 Standard
According to ISO 8601-2:2019:
- Negative durations should be represented with a minus sign before the P: `-P[duration]`
- Example: `-PT1S` for negative one second
- The standard allows flexibility with component-level negation

### Pydantic Context
1. **Deprecation Status**: The function is deprecated as of Pydantic v2.0 with warning message: "`timedelta_isoformat` is deprecated."

2. **Historical Context**: There was a previous bug report (Issue #3899) in 2022 about this exact issue where negative timedeltas produced incorrect ISO strings. A fix was supposedly merged in PR #3909.

3. **Current State**: The function still exists in the deprecated module but appears to have regressed or the fix wasn't complete.

4. **Intended Behavior**: Based on the docstring claiming "ISO 8601 encoding", the function should produce valid ISO 8601 duration strings that correctly represent the duration value.

### Documentation Gaps
1. No explicit documentation about handling negative timedeltas
2. No warning about known issues with negative values
3. No examples showing expected input/output behavior
4. The deprecation warning doesn't mention alternative approaches for users still needing this functionality

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: Function should produce ISO 8601 compliant strings that accurately represent the duration
- **Actual**: Function produces strings that follow ISO 8601 syntax but represent incorrect duration values for negative timedeltas

### Conclusion
The documentation claims ISO 8601 compliance but doesn't specify limitations. Since ISO 8601-2:2019 defines how negative durations should be represented, and the function claims to provide "ISO 8601 encoding", the current behavior is incorrect according to both the standard and the reasonable interpretation of the documentation.
