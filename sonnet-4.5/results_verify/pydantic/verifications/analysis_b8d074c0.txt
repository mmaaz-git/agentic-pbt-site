TRIAGE ANALYSIS FOR PYDANTIC EXPERIMENTAL PIPELINE BUG REPORT

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This is an internal implementation detail of an experimental module that is explicitly marked as subject to change. The _apply_constraint function is a private function (indicated by the leading underscore), and there's no documentation specifying that all constraint types must behave identically. The current behavior, while inconsistent, doesn't cause incorrect validation - it just adds redundant checks. The function still works correctly from a validation perspective.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report accurately describes a real inconsistency in the code. The Gt constraint has an else clause while Ge, Lt, Le, Len, and MultipleOf do not. This is clearly unintentional based on code structure - the indentation and flow suggest the function definitions should be in else blocks. The redundant validation does impact performance and schema introspection.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is in an experimental module with explicit warnings about API instability. The issue is primarily about performance optimization and consistency rather than correctness - the validation still works properly. The redundant function wrapper doesn't break anything, it just adds minor overhead. Given that this is experimental code, maintainers might not prioritize optimizing internal implementation details that don't affect correctness.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial (adding 'else:' statements) and improves code consistency. The performance impact, while minor per operation, could accumulate in applications with many validations. The inconsistent schema types ('int' vs 'function-after') could affect code that introspects schemas. This seems like a clear oversight rather than intentional design.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There's no documentation specifying the expected behavior of _apply_constraint or whether constraints should return consistent schema types. If the current behavior is intentional (perhaps Gt was optimized first as a proof of concept), then documentation should explain why some constraints behave differently. The experimental nature of the module means documentation might be incomplete.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is clearly a code inconsistency, not a documentation issue. The pattern in the code strongly suggests all constraints should follow the same if/else structure as Gt. The lack of else clauses appears to be an oversight, not a deliberate design choice that needs documenting. The function is private/internal, so detailed documentation isn't expected.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Optimizing the constraint application to avoid redundant validation could be seen as a performance enhancement feature. The request to make all constraints behave consistently like Gt could be viewed as requesting a new optimization feature rather than fixing a bug. The experimental nature of the module means this could be considered future work.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality - it's pointing out inconsistent implementation of existing functionality. The Gt constraint already implements the optimization, so this is about fixing the other constraints to match, not adding new features. The code structure strongly suggests this was intended to work consistently but was incompletely implemented.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code clearly shows inconsistent implementation between Gt and other constraints. The indentation of the function definitions after the if blocks strongly suggests they should be in else clauses. This causes redundant validation (performance issue) and inconsistent schema types (introspection issue). The pattern is so clear that it appears to be an implementation oversight rather than intentional design.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The module is explicitly marked as experimental and subject to change. The validation still works correctly, just with redundant checks. This is a private/internal function not part of the public API. The issue is more about optimization and consistency than correctness. Experimental code often has such inconsistencies that get cleaned up over time.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report describes a real inconsistency in the implementation of _apply_constraint where Gt has an else clause to avoid redundant validation while Ge, Lt, Le, Len, and MultipleOf do not. The technical analysis is accurate and the reproduction is valid. However, several factors weigh against treating this as a bug:

First, this is in an experimental module with explicit warnings that the API is subject to change. The pydantic.experimental package even shows a PydanticExperimentalWarning when imported. Experimental code is expected to have rough edges and inconsistencies that get refined over time.

Second, the issue is in a private/internal function (_apply_constraint) that is not part of the documented public API. Users should not be directly relying on the internal implementation details or the specific schema structures returned by these private functions. The public API (the gt(), ge(), lt(), le() methods) continues to work correctly.

Third, while the redundant validation does add overhead and the schema types differ, the actual validation behavior is correct. Values are properly validated against the constraints. This is an optimization and consistency issue, not a correctness issue. Given the experimental nature and the fact that validation still works properly, this seems more like a minor performance optimization that could be addressed in future iterations of the experimental API rather than a bug that needs immediate fixing.
