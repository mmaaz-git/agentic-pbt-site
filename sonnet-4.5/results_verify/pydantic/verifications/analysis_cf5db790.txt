Bug Report Triage Analysis
==========================

Evaluating the bug report against five possible categorizations:

1. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The function is explicitly named and documented as converting FROM snake_case TO PascalCase
- The parameter is named `snake`, clearly indicating expected input format
- Documentation never claims idempotency
- The function works correctly for its documented use case (snake_case input)
- Applying a snake_case converter to non-snake_case input is arguably user error

Arguments AGAINST:
- User expectations for case converters often include idempotency
- The function is used in contexts where mixed input is possible (e.g., alias_generator)
- Many case conversion utilities are idempotent by design

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
-----------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Edge case that only affects users who misuse the function
- Workaround exists: check if string is already PascalCase before applying
- The real-world impact is limited
- The function name clearly indicates its purpose

Arguments AGAINST:
- This could affect real users in pipelines or when processing mixed data
- The fix is relatively simple
- Idempotency is a valuable property for transformation functions

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
--------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Idempotency is not a documented feature
- The function explicitly converts from snake_case, not from arbitrary formats
- Adding idempotency would be adding new functionality
- The TODO comment suggests future improvements are planned

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is more of a bug than a missing feature
- Users reasonably expect case converters to be idempotent
- The current behavior is counterintuitive

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation incorrect)
----------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Documentation could clarify that the function is NOT idempotent
- Documentation could warn against using on non-snake_case input
- Adding examples showing the non-idempotent behavior would help

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation is technically correct about what the function does
- The parameter name `snake` already indicates expected input
- This is more about unexpected behavior than incorrect documentation

5. BUG (Valid bug report)
-------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Idempotency is a reasonable expectation for case conversion utilities
- The function is used in alias_generator contexts where mixed input is likely
- The behavior is counterintuitive (converting 'AA' to 'Aa')
- Other similar utilities in the ecosystem are typically idempotent
- The fix is straightforward and improves the function

Arguments AGAINST:
- Function works as documented for snake_case input
- Never claimed to be idempotent
- Parameter name clearly indicates expected input format

Final Assessment:
-----------------
This is a borderline case between INVALID and FEATURE_REQUEST. The function technically works as documented - it converts snake_case to PascalCase. However, the lack of idempotency could be considered either:

1. INVALID - because the function is being used outside its documented scope (non-snake_case input)
2. FEATURE_REQUEST - because idempotency would be a useful enhancement

Given that:
- The documentation explicitly states "snake_case string to PascalCase"
- The parameter is named `snake`
- There's a TODO comment acknowledging the naming could be clearer
- The function works correctly for its stated purpose

This leans toward INVALID, as the user is expecting behavior that was never promised or documented.
