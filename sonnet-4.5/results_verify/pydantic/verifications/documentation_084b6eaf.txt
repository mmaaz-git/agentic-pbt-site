## Documentation Analysis

### Function Docstring

The `decimal_encoder` function's docstring states:

"Encodes a Decimal as int of there's no exponent, otherwise float.

This is useful when we use ConstrainedDecimal to represent Numeric(x,0) where a integer (but not int typed) is used. **Encoding this as a float results in failed round-tripping between encode and parse. Our Id type is a prime example of this.**"

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Purpose Statement**: The docstring explicitly acknowledges that "encoding this as a float results in failed round-tripping between encode and parse."

2. **Contradictory Implementation**: Despite stating that encoding as float causes round-trip failures, the function still encodes decimals with fractional parts as floats.

3. **Intended Use Case**: The documentation suggests this function is meant for ConstrainedDecimal representing Numeric(x,0) - which implies integer-like values without fractional parts.

4. **Example Output**: The docstring shows:
   - `Decimal("1.0")` returns `1.0` (float)
   - `Decimal("1")` returns `1` (int)

### External Documentation

1. **GitHub Issue #1511**: There's a documented issue from years ago about Decimal JSON encoding being lossy, with community consensus that Decimals should be encoded as strings to preserve precision.

2. **Pydantic v2 Changes**: The function is in the `deprecated` module, and Pydantic v2 has moved away from custom json_encoders in favor of field serializers.

3. **Industry Standard**: Most serialization libraries (Django REST Framework, etc.) serialize Decimals as strings to maintain precision.

### Documentation Interpretation

The docstring creates confusion by:
1. Acknowledging that float encoding causes round-trip failures
2. Yet still encoding fractional Decimals as floats
3. Not clearly limiting the function's scope to integer-only Decimals

The documentation appears to be describing a known limitation/bug rather than the intended behavior. The statement "encoding this as a float results in failed round-tripping" seems to be a warning about what the function does wrong, not a description of what it prevents.
