## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the findings:

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is **CONFIRMED**. When an `on_error` handler raises an exception while handling a `ValidationError`, the handler's exception completely replaces the original `ValidationError`.

### Test Results

1. **Property-Based Test (Hypothesis)**:
   - The test failed as expected, confirming that handler exceptions suppress the original ValidationError
   - The test fails on ANY input values, indicating this is a consistent bug
   - Error message: "AssertionError: Original ValidationError was suppressed by handler exception"

2. **Simple Reproduction Case**:
   - Executed the provided reproduction code
   - Output confirms the bug:
     ```
     BUG: Caught RuntimeError from handler: Handler raised an exception
     The original ValidationError was suppressed!
     ```
   - Expected behavior: Should have caught the original ValidationError
   - Actual behavior: Caught RuntimeError from the handler instead

### Code Analysis
Looking at the source code in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/plugin/_schema_validator.py`, lines 112-115:

```python
except ValidationError as error:
    for on_error_handler in on_errors:
        on_error_handler(error)
    raise
```

The problem is clear: if `on_error_handler(error)` raises an exception, it will propagate out of the wrapper function before the original ValidationError can be re-raised. This violates the principle that validation errors should always be propagated to the caller.

### Impact
This is a significant bug because:
1. It breaks the contract that ValidationErrors are always propagated
2. A misbehaving plugin can mask actual validation errors
3. It makes debugging extremely difficult as the original error context is lost
4. It violates the expected behavior where plugin handlers should be observational and not affect control flow
