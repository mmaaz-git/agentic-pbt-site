## Bug Triage Analysis

### BUG (Most Likely)

**Why this should be tagged as BUG:**
1. **Public API Contract Violation**: The method `datetime_tz()` is exposed in the public API without any indication it's not implemented
2. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Similar methods (`datetime_tz_naive()`, `datetime_tz_aware()`) work correctly, creating reasonable expectation that `datetime_tz()` should work
3. **Clear Implementation Gap**: The code shows the method creates a constraint that the handler explicitly rejects with NotImplementedError
4. **No Documentation of Limitation**: Nothing in the method signature, docstring, or documentation indicates this method doesn't work
5. **Type Hints Suggest It Works**: The method has proper type hints suggesting it returns a valid Pipeline object

**Against BUG:**
- The module is marked as experimental and subject to change
- The `# type: ignore` comment suggests developers knew of issues

### FEATURE_REQUEST (Less Likely)

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. The experimental module warning states features are "subject to change and deprecation"
2. The NotImplementedError message says "not yet supported" implying future implementation
3. Could be viewed as requesting implementation of an incomplete feature

**Against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The method already exists in the public API
- This isn't asking for new functionality, but for existing API to work as expected
- Similar methods are already implemented and working

### INVALID (Unlikely)

**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. The experimental module explicitly warns about instability
2. Could argue users shouldn't expect all methods to work in experimental modules

**Against INVALID:**
- The method is publicly exposed without any indication it doesn't work
- No documentation states this limitation
- Reasonable expectation that public methods should work or be clearly marked as non-functional

### WONTFIX (Unlikely)

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. The functionality might be achievable through `datetime_with_tz()`
2. Could be considered low priority for experimental module

**Against WONTFIX:**
- The distinction between constraining (validation) and transforming (modification) is important
- `datetime_tz()` should validate that incoming datetime has specific timezone
- `datetime_with_tz()` transforms the datetime to have a different timezone
- These are fundamentally different operations

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Unlikely)

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Could document that the method is not yet implemented
2. Could add warnings to the method docstring

**Against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The core issue is the method doesn't work, not that documentation is wrong
- Documentation can't fix a non-functional public API method
- The proper fix is either implementing the method or removing it from public API

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The method is exposed in the public API with no indication it doesn't work, yet it always raises NotImplementedError. The experimental status of the module doesn't excuse having non-functional methods in the public API without clear indication. The proper solution would be either:
1. Implement the functionality (as shown in the bug report's suggested fixes)
2. Remove the method from the public API until it's ready
3. At minimum, raise NotImplementedError immediately in the method body with clear documentation
