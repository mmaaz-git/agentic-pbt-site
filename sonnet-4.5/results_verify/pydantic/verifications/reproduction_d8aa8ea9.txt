## Bug Reproduction Report

### Successfully Reproduced: YES

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The code crashes with `TypeError` exactly as described.

### Test Results:

1. **String input 'HELLO'**:
   - Expected: Should fail the integer pipeline's `ge(0)` constraint and fall back to the string pipeline, returning 'hello'
   - Actual: Crashes with `TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'`

2. **Negative integer -1**:
   - Expected: Should fail the integer pipeline's `ge(0)` constraint and fall back to the string pipeline
   - Actual: Crashes with `TypeError: descriptor 'lower' for 'str' objects doesn't apply to a 'int' object`

3. **Positive integer 5**:
   - Expected: Should pass the integer pipeline and return 5
   - Actual: Works correctly, returns 5

4. **Lowercase string 'hello'**:
   - Expected: Should fail the integer pipeline and fall back to the string pipeline, returning 'hello'
   - Actual: Crashes with `TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'`

### Hypothesis Testing:

The property-based test with Hypothesis confirmed the bug systematically:
- Found 2 distinct failure modes across 300 test cases
- String inputs consistently fail with the `>=` TypeError
- Negative integers consistently fail with the `str.lower()` TypeError

### Root Cause Analysis:

The issue is in the `_check_func` function at line 366-369 of pipeline.py:

```python
def handler(v: Any) -> Any:
    if func(v):  # This line can raise TypeError
        return v
    raise ValueError(...)
```

When the `func` (e.g., lambda checking `v >= 0`) receives an incompatible type (e.g., a string), it raises a `TypeError` that propagates uncaught. Since this is a TypeError and not a ValidationError, the union schema's fallback mechanism doesn't trigger, causing the entire validation to crash.

The bug report's diagnosis is accurate.
