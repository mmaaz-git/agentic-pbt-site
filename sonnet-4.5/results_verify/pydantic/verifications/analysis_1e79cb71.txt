## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report's core claim is factually incorrect. It states that `operator.__not__` does not exist in Python's operator module, causing an AttributeError. Testing definitively proves this is false - `operator.__not__` exists, is callable, and works correctly. The provided reproduction code does not produce the claimed AttributeError. The bug report fundamentally misidentifies the problem, making its technical analysis invalid.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
While the AttributeError claim is wrong, testing does reveal that the `not_in()` constraint doesn't validate properly. The constraint accepts values it should reject. However, this is a completely different bug than what was reported, and the proposed fixes in the bug report would not solve the actual problem.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The pipeline API is explicitly marked as experimental with warnings that it's "subject to change and deprecation." Experimental features often have known issues that aren't prioritized for fixes. The validation not working might be a known limitation of the experimental API that the maintainers are already aware of and have chosen not to fix in the current experimental state.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
If the `not_in()` method is exposed in the API and appears to be intended for use, having it silently fail validation is a serious issue that could lead to security problems or data corruption. Even experimental features should either work or clearly fail, not silently pass invalid data.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There is no documentation found that guarantees `not_in()` should work or specifies its expected behavior. The experimental nature of the API suggests the documentation might be incomplete. If the constraint validation not working is expected behavior in the current experimental state, this should be documented.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The bug report isn't about documentation being wrong or misleading. It claims a specific technical error (AttributeError) that doesn't actually occur. The fact that validation doesn't work is a code issue, not a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The `not_in()` constraint might be a planned but not yet fully implemented feature in the experimental API. The fact that the constraint can be called but doesn't validate suggests it's a stub or placeholder for future functionality. The bug report could be reframed as requesting that this constraint be properly implemented.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The code for the constraint exists and attempts to implement the logic. It's not asking for new functionality but reporting that existing code doesn't work. The presence of implementation code suggests this is intended to work now, not be a future feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Testing reveals that both `not_in()` and `in_()` constraints don't enforce validation, allowing invalid values to pass. This is clearly incorrect behavior for a validation library. Even in experimental code, constraints that exist should work or raise clear errors.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The bug report's main claim about AttributeError is completely false. The reporter misdiagnosed the issue and provided incorrect technical analysis. The proposed fixes wouldn't solve the actual problem. The experimental nature of the API and lack of documentation about these constraints suggests they might not be expected to work yet.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report presents a fascinating case of incorrect diagnosis leading to the discovery of a different issue. The reporter claims that `operator.__not__` doesn't exist and causes an AttributeError, which is demonstrably false - the function exists and works correctly. However, testing the provided code reveals that the `not_in()` constraint (and surprisingly, the `in_()` constraint too) don't actually validate data, allowing all values to pass regardless of the constraint.

The critical question is whether to reject this report for being technically incorrect about the AttributeError, or to acknowledge that it inadvertently discovered a real validation issue. The fact that the bug report's proposed fixes (changing `operator.__not__` to `not` or `operator.not_`) would not solve the actual validation problem strongly suggests the reporter doesn't understand the real issue.

Given that the pipeline API is explicitly experimental with warnings about instability, and that the bug report is fundamentally wrong about the nature of the problem, this should be closed as INVALID. The reporter's misdiagnosis, incorrect technical claims, and inappropriate fixes demonstrate this is not a valid bug report, even though testing revealed a different issue exists. If there is a validation problem with experimental constraints, that should be filed as a separate, correctly diagnosed issue.
