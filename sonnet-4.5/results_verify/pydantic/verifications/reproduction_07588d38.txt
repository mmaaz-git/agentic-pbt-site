BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

## Test 1: Simple Reproduction Case
The bug report's simple reproduction case is CORRECT:
- Input: 'my-plugin, another-plugin'
- After split(','), the result is: ['my-plugin', ' another-plugin']
- The string 'another-plugin' is NOT found in the list because the list contains ' another-plugin' (with leading space)
- The assertion fails as described in the bug report

## Test 2: Property-Based Test
The hypothesis test case is CORRECT:
- With plugin_names=['0', '00'] and add_spaces=True
- The disable string becomes: '0, 00'
- After split(','), the result is: ['0', ' 00']
- Plugin '0' is found successfully
- Plugin '00' is NOT found because the list contains ' 00' (with leading space)
- This confirms the bug exists as described

## Test 3: Pydantic Behavior Simulation
I simulated the exact behavior of pydantic's code at line 45:
```python
if disabled_plugins is not None and entry_point.name in disabled_plugins.split(','):
```

Results show:
1. 'plugin1,plugin2' (no spaces) - Both plugins correctly identified as disabled ✓
2. 'plugin1, plugin2' (space after comma) - Only 'plugin1' is disabled, 'plugin2' is NOT disabled ✗
3. 'plugin1 , plugin2' (spaces around comma) - NEITHER plugin is disabled ✗

## Technical Analysis of the Bug
The bug is REAL and occurs because:
1. Python's `str.split(',')` does NOT strip whitespace from the resulting strings
2. When comparing 'plugin2' against [' plugin2'], the comparison fails due to the leading space
3. This means any plugin name with preceding whitespace in the environment variable will NOT be disabled

## User Impact
Users who naturally format comma-separated lists with spaces (a common practice) will experience:
- Silent failure where plugins they intended to disable remain active
- No error message or warning about the formatting issue
- Potentially confusing behavior that differs from many other comma-separated configuration values

The bug report accurately describes a real issue in the code.
