## Documentation Analysis for pydantic.experimental.pipeline

### Official Documentation Status
The pydantic.experimental.pipeline module is marked as EXPERIMENTAL as of Pydantic v2.8.0. The documentation explicitly states:
- "This API is subject to change or removal"
- "We are looking for feedback and suggestions before making it a permanent part of Pydantic"
- The feature is designed to provide a more type-safe and composable validation pipeline

### Documented Behavior for Constraints
The documentation shows that validate_as() supports constraint methods including:
- gt() - greater than
- ge() - greater than or equal to
- lt() - less than
- le() - less than or equal to

Example usage from documentation:
```python
age: Annotated[int, validate_as(int).gt(0)]
```

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify
1. **Implementation details**: The documentation does not specify HOW constraints should be applied internally - whether they should use native schema constraints, validator functions, or both.

2. **Performance characteristics**: No mention of whether constraints should be validated once or multiple times.

3. **Consistency requirements**: The documentation does not explicitly state that all constraint types (gt, ge, lt, le) should behave identically in terms of their internal validation approach.

4. **Schema structure**: No documentation about the expected internal schema structure or number of validators that should be generated.

### Experimental Nature Implications
Since this is explicitly marked as experimental:
- The internal implementation details are not part of the public API contract
- Performance characteristics and internal schema structures are subject to change
- The focus is on functional correctness (does it validate correctly?) not implementation efficiency

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify that constraint implementations must be consistent in terms of how many validators they generate or whether they should use native schema constraints vs validator functions. This is an internal implementation detail of an experimental API. The bug report is complaining about an inconsistency in internal implementation that has no documented behavior requirement.
