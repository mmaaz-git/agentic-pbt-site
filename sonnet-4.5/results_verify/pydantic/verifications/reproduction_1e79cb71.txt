## Bug Reproduction Results

### 1. Initial Bug Claim: AttributeError

**Claimed Error**: `AttributeError: module 'operator' has no attribute '__not__'`
**Actual Result**: NO AttributeError occurs

The bug report's primary claim is FALSE. Testing shows:
- `operator.__not__` exists and is callable
- `operator.__not__(True)` returns `False` correctly
- `operator.__not__(False)` returns `True` correctly
- No AttributeError is raised when using the `not_in()` constraint

### 2. Actual Behavior Found

While the AttributeError claim is false, testing revealed a DIFFERENT bug:
- The `not_in()` constraint does NOT validate correctly
- Values that should be rejected (5, 10, 15) are accepted
- The constraint function logic is correct but validation doesn't enforce it

Test results:
- Model with `.not_in([5, 10, 15])` accepts value 5 (should reject)
- Model with `.not_in([5, 10, 15])` accepts value 10 (should reject)
- Model with `.not_in([5, 10, 15])` accepts value 15 (should reject)

### 3. Related Issue: in_() Constraint

Testing also revealed:
- The `in_()` constraint ALSO doesn't validate correctly
- It accepts all values regardless of the constraint
- This suggests a systemic issue with constraint validation in the pipeline API

### 4. Code Analysis

The code at line 631:
```python
return operator.__not__(operator.__contains__(values, v))
```

- This code is syntactically valid
- The logic produces correct boolean results when tested independently
- The issue is NOT with `operator.__not__` existence

### 5. Hypothesis Test

The provided hypothesis test fails, but NOT for the claimed reason:
- Fails because validation doesn't work (values aren't rejected)
- Does NOT fail due to AttributeError

### 6. Summary

The bug report is INCORRECT about the nature of the problem:
- **Claimed**: Code crashes with AttributeError because `operator.__not__` doesn't exist
- **Reality**: Code runs without error but validation constraints are not enforced

The actual issue appears to be that pipeline constraints are not being applied during validation, which is a different bug entirely.
