REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

## Hypothesis Test Results

The Hypothesis-based property test fails immediately with the first generated value (x=0). The test confirms that:
- `pipeline.eq(x)` returns a `_Pipeline` object (as expected)
- `pipeline == x` returns a `bool` object (unexpected, according to the bug report)

The test failure occurs with the assertion error:
```
AssertionError: pipeline == 0 should return _Pipeline, got <class 'bool'>
```

Similarly, the test for the `!=` operator would fail the same way.

## Manual Reproduction Results

The manual reproduction code produces the exact output claimed in the bug report:
```
pipeline.eq(5): <class 'pydantic.experimental.pipeline._Pipeline'>
pipeline == 5: <class 'bool'>
pipeline.not_eq(5): <class 'pydantic.experimental.pipeline._Pipeline'>
pipeline != 5: <class 'bool'>
```

This confirms the behavioral inconsistency described:
1. The `.eq()` method returns a `_Pipeline` object
2. The `==` operator returns a `bool` value
3. The `.not_eq()` method returns a `_Pipeline` object
4. The `!=` operator returns a `bool` value

## Impact

The current behavior means that:
- `pipeline.eq(5)` can be chained with other pipeline operations
- `pipeline == 5` evaluates to True/False and cannot be chained
- This creates an inconsistent API where the operator and method versions behave differently

The bug report accurately describes the current behavior of the code.
