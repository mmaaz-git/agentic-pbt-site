## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report is based on a fundamental technical error about Python operators. The report claims that `operator.__not__` is the bitwise NOT operator (`~`), when in fact it implements logical NOT. Testing conclusively shows that `operator.__not__(True)` returns `False` and `operator.__not__(False)` returns `True`, which are the correct boolean values for logical negation. The constraint works exactly as intended, properly rejecting values that are in the exclusion list and accepting values that are not. The hypothesis test from the bug report itself passes all 50 test cases when actually run.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
There is virtually no reason to consider this as anything but invalid. The bug reporter's entire premise is based on a misunderstanding of Python's operator module. All empirical testing confirms the code works correctly.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue that using `operator.__not__` instead of the simpler `not` keyword is unnecessarily verbose and could be confusing to some developers. However, this would be a style preference rather than a bug, and the code functions correctly as written.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
WONTFIX implies acknowledging a real issue but choosing not to fix it. Since there is no actual bug here - the code works correctly - this categorization doesn't apply.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The experimental pipeline API documentation is sparse and doesn't explicitly document the behavior of individual constraints like `not_in`. One could argue that better documentation might have prevented this misunderstanding. However, the lack of documentation doesn't make the implementation wrong, and the bug report isn't about documentation - it's claiming the code is broken.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The bug report makes specific false technical claims about operator behavior and asserts the code doesn't work. This isn't a documentation issue - it's a fundamental misunderstanding of Python operators by the reporter. The code works exactly as any Python developer familiar with the operator module would expect.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
If someone preferred using the `not` keyword instead of `operator.__not__` for stylistic reasons, that could be framed as a feature request for code simplification. However, the bug report isn't asking for a style change - it's claiming the existing code is broken.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report explicitly states this is a logic bug with "High" severity and provides a "fix" to make the code work. The reporter believes the current implementation is broken, not that they want a new feature. Feature requests are for new functionality, not for "fixing" code that already works correctly.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The only way this could be considered a bug is if one accepts the false premise that `operator.__not__` is the bitwise NOT operator. Under that incorrect assumption, the logic would indeed be wrong. However, this premise is factually incorrect.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Extensive testing proves the implementation works correctly. The hypothesis test passes, manual testing shows proper validation behavior, and the fundamental claim about `operator.__not__` being bitwise NOT is demonstrably false. The code rejects values in the exclusion list and accepts values not in the list, exactly as the constraint name suggests. There is no bug.

## Overall Consideration
The bug report is fundamentally flawed due to a critical misunderstanding of Python's operator module. The reporter incorrectly believes that `operator.__not__` implements bitwise NOT (`~`), when it actually implements logical NOT. This false premise leads them to conclude that the validation logic is broken, when in fact it works perfectly. Testing with their own provided hypothesis test shows the constraint correctly rejects excluded values and accepts non-excluded values.

The implementation uses `operator.__not__(operator.__contains__(values, v))` which correctly returns `False` when the value is in the list (should reject) and `True` when the value is not in the list (should accept). This is exactly the intended behavior for a `not_in` constraint. While one might argue the code could use the simpler `not` keyword instead of `operator.__not__`, both produce identical results and this is a matter of style, not correctness.

Given that the bug report is based on a demonstrably false technical claim, makes incorrect assertions about the code's behavior, and all testing confirms the code works correctly, this must be classified as INVALID. The roughly 10% valid bug rate mentioned in the instructions aligns with rejecting this report, as it represents the type of incorrect bug report that makes up the other 90%.
