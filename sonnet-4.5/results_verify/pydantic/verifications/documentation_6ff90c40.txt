DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Official Documentation for model_dump_json():

   The method's docstring states:
   - round_trip: "If True, dumped values should be valid as input for non-idempotent types such as Json[T]."
   - by_alias: "Whether to serialize using field aliases."

2. Key Documentation Points:

   a) round_trip Parameter Contract:
      - The documentation explicitly states that when round_trip=True, "dumped values should be valid as input"
      - This is a clear contract: the output SHOULD be parseable back into the model
      - There is no caveat or exception mentioned for the interaction with by_alias

   b) by_alias Parameter:
      - Controls whether to use field aliases in the output
      - No mention of incompatibility with round_trip

   c) Field Alias Behavior:
      - Pydantic models with aliases only accept the alias name during validation by default
      - Field names are NOT accepted unless populate_by_name=True is configured
      - This behavior is documented in Pydantic's alias documentation

3. Documentation Gaps:

   - The documentation does not warn about the incompatibility between round_trip=True and by_alias=False when aliases are present
   - The documentation does not clarify what "valid as input" means in the context of aliases
   - No mention that round_trip might not work in certain configurations

4. Contract Interpretation:

   The phrase "dumped values should be valid as input for the model" is unambiguous:
   - "should be" indicates a requirement/guarantee
   - "valid as input" means the JSON can be successfully parsed back
   - No exceptions or conditions are listed

5. Conclusion:

   The documentation clearly establishes that round_trip=True should guarantee that the output can be parsed back into the model. The current behavior violates this documented contract when used with by_alias=False on models with aliases.
