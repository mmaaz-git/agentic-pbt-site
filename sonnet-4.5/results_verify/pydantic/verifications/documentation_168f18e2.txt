DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Documentation Findings

### str_strip() Method Documentation
The str_strip() method in pydantic.experimental.pipeline has NO docstring or explicit documentation. The method is defined as:

```python
def str_strip(self: _Pipeline[_InT, str]) -> _Pipeline[_InT, str]:
    return self.transform(str.strip)
```

This implementation directly calls `self.transform(str.strip)`, which strongly implies that it should behave exactly like Python's built-in `str.strip()` method.

### transform() Method Documentation
The transform() method's docstring states:
"Transform the output of the previous step. If used as the first step in a pipeline, the type of the field is used. That is, the transformation is applied to after the value is parsed to the field's type."

This documentation indicates that when transform() is called with a function (like str.strip), that function should be applied to transform the value.

### Experimental Module Warning
The module includes a warning that it is experimental and "its contents are subject to change and deprecation." However, this does not excuse incorrect behavior - it only warns that the API may change.

## User Expectations

Based on the code structure and method naming:

1. **Method Name**: The method is named `str_strip()`, directly mirroring Python's `str.strip()`
2. **Implementation**: It calls `transform(str.strip)`, explicitly using Python's str.strip function
3. **No Documentation Override**: There is no documentation stating that str_strip() behaves differently from Python's str.strip()
4. **Consistency Pattern**: Other string methods like str_lower(), str_upper(), str_title() all call their corresponding Python string methods

Users would reasonably expect str_strip() to behave identically to Python's str.strip() method, stripping ALL whitespace characters as defined by Unicode, not just a subset of ASCII whitespace.

## Documentation Verdict

The lack of documentation does not make this behavior undefined. The method name and implementation clearly establish a contract that str_strip() should behave like str.strip(). The current behavior violates this implicit but clear contract.

This is NOT a documentation issue - the code is behaving incorrectly relative to its obvious intended behavior and user expectations.
