# Documentation Analysis

## Pydantic Documentation
I attempted to find documentation for the `pydantic.deprecated.json.pydantic_encoder` function but:
1. The API documentation for the deprecated module returns 404 errors
2. The general serialization documentation does not mention specific bytes handling
3. There is no explicit specification about UTF-8 requirements for bytes in the available documentation

## JSON Specification
According to the JSON specification (json.org):
- JSON supports strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, and arrays
- Strings are defined as "a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters"
- JSON does not have native support for binary data/bytes
- The specification does not define how bytes should be encoded

## Python's Standard Behavior
Testing Python's built-in json module reveals:
1. The standard json module raises TypeError for bytes objects (not JSON serializable)
2. Common practice is to use base64 encoding for arbitrary bytes
3. Even valid UTF-8 bytes require explicit conversion to string

## Key Findings

### What the documentation DOES NOT specify:
1. The pydantic_encoder documentation does not explicitly state that bytes must be valid UTF-8
2. There is no documented behavior for how invalid UTF-8 bytes should be handled
3. The documentation does not warn about potential UnicodeDecodeError

### Reasonable expectations:
1. Since JSON doesn't natively support bytes, some encoding is necessary
2. The current implementation assumes all bytes are UTF-8 text (by calling decode() without parameters)
3. This assumption is not documented and fails for arbitrary binary data

### Industry practices:
1. Base64 encoding is the standard approach for arbitrary bytes in JSON
2. Alternatively, bytes could be converted to hex strings
3. If bytes are known to be text, explicit UTF-8 decoding with error handling is common

## Conclusion
The documentation does not specify that bytes must be valid UTF-8, nor does it document that the encoder will crash on non-UTF-8 bytes. The current behavior (assuming UTF-8 and crashing on invalid sequences) is undocumented and unexpected given that bytes can contain arbitrary binary data.
