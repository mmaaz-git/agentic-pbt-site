DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Official Documentation Findings

### Plugin System Documentation
The Pydantic plugin documentation (https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.4/concepts/plugins/) states:
- Plugins are marked as "Experimental" and "subject to change in minor releases"
- The documentation provides examples of plugin handlers but does NOT specify what should happen when handlers raise exceptions
- No explicit mention of error isolation between plugins
- No guidance on handler exception handling behavior

### Protocol Definitions
From the source code in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/plugin/__init__.py`:
- BaseValidateHandlerProtocol defines on_enter, on_success, on_error, on_exception methods
- Default implementations in the protocol simply return (no-op)
- No documentation about exception handling in these methods
- Methods have docstrings describing their purpose but not error behavior

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No Exception Handling Specification**: The documentation does not specify what happens when plugin handlers raise exceptions. This is a critical omission.

2. **No Plugin Isolation Guarantees**: No mention of whether plugins should be isolated from each other's failures.

3. **No Error Priority Documentation**: No guidance on whether original errors should take precedence over plugin errors.

4. **Experimental Status**: The plugin system is explicitly marked as experimental, suggesting the behavior may not be fully specified.

## Common Plugin System Patterns

In well-designed plugin systems (e.g., pytest, Django middleware):
- Plugin errors are typically isolated and logged
- Original errors/results are preserved
- All plugins get a chance to run regardless of others' failures
- Plugin exceptions don't mask application errors

## Conclusion

The documentation provides NO specification for how plugin handler exceptions should be handled. This is a significant documentation gap for a plugin system. Users would reasonably expect:
1. Plugin isolation (one plugin's failure shouldn't affect others)
2. Original errors to be preserved
3. All registered handlers to execute

The current behavior violates these reasonable expectations, even though it's not explicitly documented.
