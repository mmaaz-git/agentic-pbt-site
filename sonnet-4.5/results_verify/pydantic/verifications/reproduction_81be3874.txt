## Bug Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. Here are the technical details:

### Test Case Execution:

The provided test case with `Decimal('129452608601646.99')` was executed and confirmed the precision loss:

```
Original:      129452608601646.99
Reconstructed: 129452608601646.98
Equal:         False
Loss:          0.01
```

### Root Cause Analysis:

1. **JSON Serialization Path**: When calling `model.json()`, pydantic uses the `decimal_encoder` function which converts the Decimal to a float: `129452608601646.98`

2. **Float Precision Limitation**: The value `129452608601646.99` cannot be exactly represented as a IEEE 754 double precision float. When converted to float, it becomes `129452608601646.98` due to binary representation limitations.

3. **Deserialization**: When parsing the JSON back with `parse_raw()`, the float value `129452608601646.98` is converted back to a Decimal, but the precision is already lost.

### Comparison with dict() Method:

I verified that `model.dict()` + `parse_obj()` preserves Decimal precision correctly:
- Dict representation: `{'value': Decimal('129452608601646.99')}`
- This round-trips perfectly because the Decimal object is preserved in Python's dict

### Hypothesis Test Results:

The hypothesis property-based test failed immediately on the provided example, confirming the bug is reproducible and systematic for large decimal values with fractional parts.

### Technical Verification:

The pydantic source code explicitly shows:
- Line 51 in json.py: `Decimal: decimal_encoder`
- Lines 38-41: `return float(dec_value)` for decimals with fractional parts

This is working as designed - pydantic v1 intentionally converts Decimals to floats for JSON serialization, which causes precision loss for values that cannot be exactly represented in IEEE 754 double precision format.
