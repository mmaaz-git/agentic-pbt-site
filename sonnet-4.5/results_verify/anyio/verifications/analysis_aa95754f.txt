TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The implementation follows standard Python library conventions
- The behavior (notify at most n) is reasonable and expected

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The docstring explicitly promises "exactly n" which is factually incorrect
- The bug report correctly identifies a mismatch between documentation and implementation
- This is not a case of undefined behavior - the documentation makes a specific claim

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID - there is a genuine documentation/implementation mismatch

### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The edge case (n > waiters) is relatively uncommon in practice
- The current behavior is sensible and matches standard library behavior

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Documentation accuracy is important for API contracts
- The fix is trivial (change two words in the docstring)
- This is not an obscure internal detail but a public API method

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX - documentation accuracy matters for public APIs

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- If someone wanted the method to actually notify exactly n (perhaps by raising an error when insufficient waiters)

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The bug report is not asking for new functionality
- It's asking for documentation to match implementation
- The current behavior is correct; only the documentation is wrong

**Verdict:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - this is about fixing existing documentation

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it IS DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The implementation behavior is correct and matches Python standard library conventions
- Both threading.Condition and asyncio.Condition use "at most n" semantics
- The only issue is the docstring incorrectly saying "exactly n"
- The proposed fix correctly changes the docstring to "at most n"
- The code performs something reasonable but is not accurately described

**Why it might NOT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- None - this is clearly a documentation issue

**Verdict:** IS DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the docstring needs to be corrected

### BUG
**Why it might be BUG:**
- There is a contract violation between documentation and implementation

**Why it's NOT BUG:**
- The implementation is correct and follows standard conventions
- The behavior is sensible and matches Python's standard library
- This is not a code defect but a documentation inaccuracy
- Fixing the code to match the documentation would be wrong

**Verdict:** NOT BUG - the code is correct, only documentation needs fixing

## Final Assessment

This is a clear case of DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The implementation of `notify(n)` correctly follows Python standard library conventions by notifying "at most n" listeners. The docstring incorrectly claims it will notify "exactly n" listeners, which is:

1. Factually incorrect when waiters < n
2. Inconsistent with Python standard library documentation
3. Creates a false contract that misleads users

The bug report correctly identifies this issue and proposes the appropriate fix: changing the docstring from "Notify exactly n listeners" to "Notify at most n listeners". This aligns with both the actual implementation and standard Python conventions.
