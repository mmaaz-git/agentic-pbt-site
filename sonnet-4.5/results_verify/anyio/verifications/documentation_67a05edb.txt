## Documentation Analysis for _validate_socket

### Function Existence and Location
The `_validate_socket` function exists in the anyio library's master branch on GitHub in the file `src/anyio/abc/_sockets.py`. It's an internal/private function (indicated by the leading underscore) that is not documented in the public API documentation.

### Documentation Findings
1. **Public Documentation**: The function is NOT documented in the official anyio documentation at https://anyio.readthedocs.io/. The API reference does not list this function, which makes sense as it's a private internal function.

2. **Function Purpose** (from source code examination):
   - The function validates socket parameters
   - It accepts either a socket object or a file descriptor (int)
   - It checks socket type and address family
   - It can validate connection and binding status

3. **Error Handling Behavior** (from source code):
   The current implementation handles OSError exceptions as follows:
   - If errno is ENOTSOCK: Converts to ValueError with message "the file descriptor does not refer to a socket"
   - If require_connected is True and there's an OSError: Raises ValueError "the socket must be connected"
   - If require_bound is True and there's an OSError: Raises ValueError "the socket must be bound to a local address"
   - Otherwise: Re-raises the original OSError

### Documentation Implications
Since this is a private internal function (prefixed with underscore), there is no public API contract that users should rely on. The error handling behavior is not documented, and as an internal function, its behavior could theoretically change without being considered a breaking change.

The bug report assumes this function should have consistent error handling behavior, but there's no documentation specifying what exceptions should be raised for different error conditions. The function's error handling appears to be implementation-defined rather than specification-driven.

### Key Question
The critical question is whether EBADF (bad file descriptor) errors should be treated the same as ENOTSOCK errors. The current implementation only special-cases ENOTSOCK, suggesting that the developers intentionally chose to handle only this specific error case differently.
