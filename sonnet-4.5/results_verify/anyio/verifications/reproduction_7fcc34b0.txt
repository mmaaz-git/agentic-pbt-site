Bug Reproduction Analysis
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. Hypothesis Test Execution:
   - The Hypothesis property-based test failed exactly as described in the bug report
   - When run with low_mark=10 and high_mark=5, the test raises an AssertionError
   - The error message confirms: "Negative limit: low_mark=10, high_mark=5, limit=-5"
   - This validates that _get_limit_offset_params returns a negative limit value

2. Manual Reproduction:
   - Running the manual reproduction code confirms the bug behavior
   - Output: "Generated SQL: LIMIT -5 OFFSET 10"
   - The limit_offset_sql method indeed generates invalid SQL with a negative LIMIT value
   - The _get_limit_offset_params returns (-5, 10) when given low_mark=10, high_mark=5

3. Source Code Analysis:
   - Examined lines 259-277 of django/db/backends/base/operations.py
   - Line 262 performs the calculation: (high_mark - offset), offset
   - When high_mark=5 and offset=10, this evaluates to (5-10, 10) = (-5, 10)
   - Line 273 then formats this as "LIMIT -5" without any validation

4. Effect of the Bug:
   - The method generates SQL with "LIMIT -5 OFFSET 10"
   - This is invalid SQL syntax - LIMIT values must be non-negative in SQL standard
   - Most SQL databases will reject this query with a syntax error
   - This could cause runtime failures when the generated SQL is executed

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
