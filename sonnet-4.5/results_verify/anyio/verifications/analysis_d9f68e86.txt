## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation never specifies that DelimiterNotFound should have a max_bytes attribute. The exception's documented purpose is to signal that a delimiter was not found, and it fulfills this contract by raising an exception with a descriptive message. The bug report assumes behavior that was never promised or documented. Additionally, most Python exceptions don't preserve their initialization parameters as attributes - they typically just format them into error messages.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The technical observation is correct - the exception does discard the max_bytes value after using it for the message. The bug report accurately describes the current implementation and the limitation it creates for programmatic error handling.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a minor enhancement to exception handling that likely affects very few users. Most error handling code simply catches the exception and either retries with different parameters or gives up. The ability to programmatically access max_bytes from the exception is a nice-to-have feature but not critical for the library's functionality. Users can work around this by maintaining their own state about what max_bytes value they used.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial (one line of code) and maintains backward compatibility. There's precedent in the same file (BrokenWorkerInterpreter) for preserving exception parameters. The enhancement would improve the API's usability for programmatic error handling without any downside.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be clearer about what attributes exceptions have and don't have. If the current behavior (not preserving max_bytes) is intentional, the documentation should explicitly state that the exception only provides a formatted message and doesn't expose the original parameters.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current documentation doesn't make any false claims - it simply doesn't specify exception attributes at all. The absence of documentation about attributes could be interpreted as them not existing, which is accurate.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is asking for new functionality - adding an attribute that doesn't currently exist. The exception works as designed (raises when delimiter not found with descriptive message), and the request is to enhance it with additional capabilities for programmatic access to the limit value. This is clearly an enhancement rather than fixing broken behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The report frames this as a bug ("loses max_bytes value") rather than a feature request. The precedent of BrokenWorkerInterpreter preserving its parameter suggests this might be expected behavior rather than a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There's an inconsistency in the codebase where BrokenWorkerInterpreter preserves its excinfo parameter but DelimiterNotFound doesn't preserve max_bytes. This inconsistency could be seen as a bug. The exception accepts structured data (max_bytes) but unnecessarily converts it to unstructured data (string message), violating good exception design principles.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The exception behaves exactly as coded and documented. It raises when the delimiter isn't found and provides a descriptive error message. The documentation never promises a max_bytes attribute. Different exceptions having different designs isn't necessarily a bug - they serve different purposes and may have different requirements.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report presents a reasonable enhancement request disguised as a bug. The technical analysis is correct - the DelimiterNotFound exception does discard the max_bytes parameter after formatting it into a message. However, this behavior is not incorrect per se, as the documentation never specifies that this attribute should be available.

The strongest argument for this being a valid issue is the precedent set by BrokenWorkerInterpreter in the same file, which does preserve its initialization parameter. This suggests that anyio exceptions can and should preserve structured data when it might be useful for programmatic error handling. However, this is more of a design consistency issue than a bug.

The practical impact is minimal. While the report lists several "real-world impacts," these are largely theoretical. Most users catching DelimiterNotFound will either retry with a larger buffer (using a value they control) or give up entirely. The ability to access e.max_bytes is a nice-to-have but not essential. This should be categorized as a FEATURE_REQUEST - it's asking for an enhancement to make exception handling more convenient, not reporting broken functionality.
