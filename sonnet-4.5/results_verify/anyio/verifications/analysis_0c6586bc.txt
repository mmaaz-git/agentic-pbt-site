## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments for BUG:**
1. **Clear Inconsistency**: The code treats `local_port` and `remote_port` differently without any justification. One makes syscalls on every access, the other caches the value.
2. **Performance Impact**: Making unnecessary syscalls on every access to `local_port` is inefficient and wasteful.
3. **No Documented Reason**: The documentation doesn't explain why these similar attributes should behave differently.
4. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Users would reasonably expect similar attributes to behave similarly.
5. **The Fix is Straightforward**: The proposed fix simply makes both attributes behave consistently by caching both values.

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The code works correctly in terms of returning the right values
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise consistency between attributes

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments for INVALID:**
1. The documentation doesn't specify caching behavior, so technically the implementation is not violating any documented contract.
2. Both attributes return the correct values when called.

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The inconsistency appears unintentional and has no justifiable reason
- Performance issues from unnecessary syscalls are real problems
- Just because behavior isn't documented doesn't mean obvious inconsistencies are acceptable

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
1. The issue might be considered minor since it only affects performance, not correctness.
2. Most applications probably don't access these attributes frequently enough for the performance difference to matter.

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The inconsistency is not obscure - it's in the main code path for socket attributes
- The performance impact could be significant for applications that frequently check socket attributes
- The fix is simple and low-risk

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could be reframed as "requesting consistent caching behavior across socket attributes"
2. Since caching isn't specified in docs, consistent caching could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing an inconsistency in existing code, not adding new functionality
- The current behavior appears to be a bug/oversight rather than intentional design

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation could be updated to explain why `local_port` is dynamic while `remote_port` is cached
2. Could document the performance implications of accessing these attributes

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The inconsistency appears to be a code bug, not a documentation issue
- Documenting this inconsistency would be acknowledging a design flaw rather than fixing it

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG**. The key factors are:

1. **Unintentional Inconsistency**: The different treatment of `local_port` vs `remote_port` appears to be an oversight. The code shows `remote_port` is cached simply because it was convenient (the value was already available from `getpeername()`), while `local_port` wasn't cached because the developer directly called `getsockname()` in the lambda.

2. **Real Performance Impact**: Making syscalls on every attribute access is inefficient and goes against good practice for property-like attributes.

3. **No Justifiable Reason**: There's no technical reason why `local_port` needs to be dynamic while `remote_port` is cached. For connected sockets, both values are equally stable.

4. **Simple Fix**: The proposed fix is straightforward, low-risk, and makes the code more consistent and efficient.

This is not a trivial issue (ruling out WONTFIX), not a missing feature (ruling out FEATURE_REQUEST), not a documentation problem (ruling out DOCUMENTATION_FIX), and not invalid just because the docs don't specify caching behavior (ruling out INVALID). It's a legitimate bug in the implementation that should be fixed.
