Documentation Analysis for MultiListener
=========================================

Documentation Found:
The class docstring for MultiListener explicitly states:

"Any MultiListeners in the given collection of listeners will have their listeners moved into this one."

Key word here is "moved" - not "copied" or "referenced", but "moved".

Analysis of Documentation vs Implementation:
1. The documentation uses the word "moved" which could be interpreted as transferring ownership
2. However, the documentation doesn't explicitly state that the original MultiListener will be mutated
3. The phrase "moved into this one" is ambiguous - it could mean:
   a) The listeners are copied/transferred to the new MultiListener
   b) The listeners are moved (destructively) from the source to the destination

Current Implementation:
- Line 115: `listeners.extend(listener.listeners)` - copies the references
- Line 116: `del listener.listeners[:]` - clears the original list

Documentation Interpretation:
The documentation does mention "moved" which could technically justify the mutation behavior. However:
1. In Python, "move" semantics are not common - most operations copy or share references
2. The documentation doesn't explicitly warn about the destructive nature of this operation
3. Users would not typically expect that passing an object to a constructor would mutate that object
4. The term "moved" could reasonably be interpreted as "the listeners from nested MultiListeners are incorporated into this one"

Conclusion:
The documentation is ambiguous. While it uses the word "moved", it doesn't clearly communicate that:
- The nested MultiListener will be mutated
- The nested MultiListener becomes unusable after this operation
- This is a destructive operation

The documentation could be clearer about this side effect if it's intentional, or the behavior could be considered unexpected based on Python conventions where constructors typically don't mutate their arguments.
