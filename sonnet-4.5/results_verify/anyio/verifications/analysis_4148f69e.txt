## Triage Analysis

### Option 1: BUG
**Arguments for:**
- Clear type contract violation: The type annotation promises `float` but the implementation rejects most float values
- This affects users who rely on type hints for API usage, which is a recommended Python practice
- The inconsistency between type annotation and runtime behavior is objectively incorrect
- Type annotations are part of the API contract in modern Python

**Arguments against:**
- Semantically, buffer sizes should be integers (you can't have 2.5 items)
- The error message clearly states what's accepted
- This might have been an intentional design choice with an incorrect type hint

### Option 2: INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- Buffer sizes semantically must be whole numbers - having 2.5 items doesn't make sense
- The implementation's requirement for integers is reasonable
- The error message is clear about what's accepted

**Arguments against:**
- The type annotation explicitly says `float`, creating a documented contract
- Users following type hints are doing the right thing
- If only integers were intended, the type should be `int | Literal[math.inf]` or similar

### Option 3: WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- This is a minor issue that likely affects very few users in practice
- Most users would naturally use integers for buffer sizes
- The error message immediately clarifies the requirement

**Arguments against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental type contract violation
- Type safety is important in modern Python development
- The fix is trivial (update the type annotation)

### Option 4: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- The code behaves reasonably (requiring integers for buffer size)
- Only the type annotation needs updating, not the implementation
- The actual validation logic makes semantic sense

**Arguments against:**
- Type annotations are code, not just documentation
- This could also be seen as a code bug where validation is too strict

### Option 5: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Supporting float buffer sizes could be seen as a new feature
- The current implementation works as designed, just not as typed

**Arguments against:**
- This isn't requesting new functionality - the type annotation already promises this works
- It's fixing existing broken promises, not adding features

### Summary
This is a clear case where the type annotation (API contract) doesn't match the implementation. The key question is whether type annotations constitute a binding API contract that, when violated, represents a bug. In modern Python development, type hints are increasingly treated as part of the API contract, especially in well-maintained libraries.
