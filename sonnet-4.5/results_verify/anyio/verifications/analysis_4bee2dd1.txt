## Bug Categorization Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Clear Type Contract Violation**: The type annotations explicitly declare `float` but runtime rejects non-integer floats
2. **No Documentation of Restriction**: Neither the API docs nor docstrings mention the integer-only constraint
3. **Conceptually Valid**: Fractional capacity limits make sense (e.g., 2.5 concurrent operations)
4. **User Expectation**: Developers using type hints would reasonably expect float values to work
5. **Inconsistent API**: Accepts `math.inf` (a float) but not other float values like 2.5

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None significant. This is a clear API contract violation.

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug is reproducible and the type contract is clearly violated.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The type annotation explicitly promises float support
2. The error is reproducible with valid float inputs
3. The documentation doesn't contradict the bug report's claims

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could argue that integer-only tokens is the intended design
2. Existing code might depend on integer-only behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Type annotations are part of the public API contract
2. No documented reason why fractional tokens shouldn't work
3. The fix is straightforward and non-breaking for existing valid uses
4. This is not an obscure edge case - fractional resource limits are common

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could fix by updating type annotations to `Union[int, Literal[math.inf]]`
2. Could add documentation explaining the integer-only constraint

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Fractional capacity limits are conceptually valid and useful
2. Changing type annotations would be a breaking change to the API
3. The implementation could easily support floats with minimal changes
4. Would require updating multiple type annotations across the codebase

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could frame float support as a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The type annotation already promises this "feature"
2. This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities
3. The API contract already declares float support

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation violates its own type contract by:
1. Declaring parameters as `float` type
2. Rejecting valid float values at runtime
3. Providing no documentation of this restriction

The mismatch between type annotations and runtime behavior is a textbook API contract violation. Users following the type hints will encounter unexpected TypeErrors for valid inputs according to the declared API.

The fact that `math.inf` (a float) is accepted while `2.5` is rejected shows the validation is inconsistent with its own type system. Either:
1. The implementation should accept all valid floats (preferred fix)
2. The type annotations should accurately reflect the constraint (breaking change)

Given that fractional resource limits are conceptually valid and the fix is straightforward, this should be treated as a bug in the implementation rather than a documentation issue.
