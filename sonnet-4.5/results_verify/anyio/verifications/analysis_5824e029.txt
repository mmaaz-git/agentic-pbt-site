# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Report Summary
The bug report claims that `BufferedByteReceiveStream.receive_until()` violates its contract by succeeding when the delimiter is found beyond the max_bytes limit.

## Analysis for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The documentation states "maximum number of bytes that will be read" which implies a hard limit on read operations
2. The current behavior is inconsistent - it checks buffer size only when delimiter is NOT found, but not when it IS found
3. The function can read and buffer more data than max_bytes to find a delimiter, which violates the principle of least surprise
4. The DelimiterNotFound exception specifically takes max_bytes as a parameter, suggesting it represents a hard limit
5. In the test case with delimiter=b'\x00\x00' and max_bytes=1, the function reads 2 bytes to find the delimiter but only checks if buffer >= max_bytes when delimiter is not found

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. One could argue max_bytes refers only to the returned data size, not total bytes read
2. The implementation has been this way and might have users depending on current behavior

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. If max_bytes was meant to limit only the returned data (not including delimiter), the current behavior could be considered correct
2. The documentation could be interpreted as "bytes that will be returned" rather than "bytes that will be read from stream"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation clearly says "bytes that will be read" not "bytes that will be returned"
2. The inconsistency in the implementation (checking buffer size only when delimiter not found) suggests a bug rather than intentional design
3. Test results show illogical behavior where the same limit is enforced differently based on whether delimiter is found

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Edge case that might rarely occur in practice (delimiter exactly at boundary)
2. Existing code might depend on current behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is a clear violation of documented behavior that could lead to security issues (reading more data than intended)
2. The fix is straightforward and improves consistency
3. Buffer overflow prevention is an important security consideration

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
None - the documentation already describes this behavior, it's just not implemented correctly

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation already promises this behavior
2. This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new features

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The documentation could be clarified to be more explicit about what max_bytes means
2. If the current behavior is intentional, the docs should reflect that

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation is reasonably clear - "maximum number of bytes that will be read"
2. The implementation is inconsistent with itself, suggesting the bug is in code, not docs
3. Changing documentation to match current behavior would make the function less useful and predictable

## Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The implementation fails to properly enforce the max_bytes limit as documented. The function should raise DelimiterNotFound when finding the delimiter would require reading more than max_bytes from the stream. The current implementation only checks buffer size when the delimiter is NOT found, creating an inconsistency that violates the documented contract.

The proposed fix in the bug report is appropriate - checking if the delimiter position plus its length exceeds max_bytes before returning success.
