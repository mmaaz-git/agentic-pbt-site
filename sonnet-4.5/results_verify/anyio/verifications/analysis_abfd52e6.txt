## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report is factually incorrect. It claims that `anyio.sleep_until(float('nan'))` hangs indefinitely, but testing proves it raises a ValueError immediately in Python 3.13. The underlying asyncio.sleep() function already validates and rejects NaN values with a clear error message. The reported behavior (hanging indefinitely) simply does not occur. The bug reporter either tested with an older Python version or misunderstood the actual behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
There could be an argument that in older Python versions (pre-3.13), the behavior might have been different. However, the bug report is dated 2025-09-25 and should be tested against current versions. Additionally, even if older versions had different behavior, the current implementation correctly handles the error case.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Even if we considered that anyio could add its own NaN validation before delegating to the backend, this would be redundant since the backend already handles it properly. Adding duplicate validation for an obscure edge case (passing NaN as a deadline) that no reasonable code would ever do intentionally would add unnecessary complexity. The current error from asyncio is clear and sufficient.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
WONTFIX typically applies to real bugs that are too minor to fix. Since this isn't actually a bug (the function already raises an appropriate error), WONTFIX doesn't apply. The system is working as it should.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The anyio.sleep_until() documentation doesn't explicitly state what happens with NaN inputs or that ValueError will be raised for invalid inputs. Adding a note that "Invalid numeric values like NaN will raise ValueError" could prevent confusion. The documentation could be clearer about input validation behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
It's reasonable to expect that a function accepting a float parameter should handle standard float validation, and NaN is inherently an invalid time value. Most Python functions don't explicitly document NaN handling unless they specifically support it. The current behavior (raising ValueError) is the expected Python idiom for invalid numeric inputs.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that the bug reporter wants anyio to handle NaN specially, perhaps by treating it as immediate return (delay of 0) or by providing a more specific error message at the anyio layer. This would be requesting new functionality beyond current behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current behavior (raising ValueError) is already the correct handling for NaN. There's no reasonable use case for passing NaN as a deadline intentionally, and the error message is already clear. Adding special NaN handling would be solving a non-problem.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
If the function actually hung indefinitely as reported, it would be a serious bug. The report provides a clear test case and explanation of the problem mechanism (max(nan, 0) returning nan).

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The fundamental claim is false - the function does NOT hang indefinitely. It raises ValueError immediately. The test results directly contradict the bug report's claims. The system is already working correctly by rejecting invalid input with a clear error message.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report appears to be based on incorrect assumptions or outdated information. The reporter claims that `anyio.sleep_until(float('nan'))` hangs indefinitely, but testing on Python 3.13 clearly shows it raises `ValueError: Invalid delay: NaN (not a number)` immediately. This is the correct and expected behavior.

The technical analysis in the bug report about `max(nan, 0)` returning NaN is correct, but the conclusion that this causes the function to hang is wrong. When NaN is passed to `asyncio.sleep()`, it properly validates the input and raises an error. This has been the behavior since Python 3.13, and the bug report is dated 2025-09-25, so it should be tested against current Python versions.

The most charitable interpretation would be that the documentation could be clearer about input validation, but even that's a stretch since ValueError for invalid numeric input is standard Python behavior. The proposed "fixes" in the bug report (adding NaN validation or treating NaN as 0) are unnecessary since the current implementation already handles the case appropriately by raising an error. This should be closed as INVALID.
