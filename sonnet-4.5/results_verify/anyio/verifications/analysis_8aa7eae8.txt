## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**
1. **Backend inconsistency**: The asyncio backend uses `math.isinf()` which accepts any infinity, while CapacityLimiterAdapter uses identity comparison. This is a clear inconsistency within the same codebase.
2. **Python semantics**: In Python, `float('inf') == math.inf` returns True. They represent the same mathematical value.
3. **User expectations**: Users obtaining infinity from various sources (parsing, calculations) would reasonably expect their infinity values to work.
4. **Type annotations**: The function accepts `float` type, and `float('inf')` is a valid float.
5. **Error message ambiguity**: Says "must be an int or math.inf" which doesn't explicitly require the exact object.

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Weak arguments against:**
1. The error message does specifically mention "math.inf" by name, not "infinity"
2. Could be argued that requiring the specific object is intentional for consistency
3. However, these are weak given the backend inconsistency

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Very weak case:**
1. Could argue it's a trivial issue since users can use math.inf
2. However, the inconsistency between backends makes this more than trivial
3. Users may get infinity from libraries/calculations that return float('inf')

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Not applicable:**
1. This is about fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
2. The asyncio backend already supports this, so it's not a new feature

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Possible but weak:**
1. Could document that only the exact math.inf object is accepted
2. However, this would still leave the backend inconsistency unresolved
3. The current behavior seems unintentional given the asyncio implementation

### Final Assessment:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The strongest evidence is the inconsistency between backends - the asyncio backend accepts any infinity using `math.isinf()` while the adapter uses identity comparison. This inconsistency alone makes it a bug that should be fixed. Additionally, Python users would reasonably expect `float('inf')` to work since it equals `math.inf`, and the type system accepts float values.
