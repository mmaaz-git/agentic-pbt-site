## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the reported behavior using both the simple test case and the hypothesis-based property test provided in the bug report.

### Test Results:

1. **Address caching behavior (confirmed)**:
   - `local_address` calls `getsockname()` on every access (not cached)
   - `remote_address` calls `getpeername()` only once during initialization (cached)
   - The bug report's claim is technically correct about this inconsistency

2. **Port caching behavior (also confirmed)**:
   - `local_port` calls `getsockname()` on every access (not cached)
   - `remote_port` uses the cached `peername` value (cached)
   - This exhibits the same pattern as the address attributes

### Technical Details Verified:

Looking at the source code (lines 148-176 in _sockets.py):
- `local_address` lambda: `lambda: convert(self._raw_socket.getsockname())` - calls getsockname() each time
- `remote_address` lambda: `lambda: peername` - uses pre-computed peername value
- `local_port` lambda: `lambda: self._raw_socket.getsockname()[1]` - calls getsockname() each time
- `remote_port` lambda: `lambda: remote_port` - uses pre-computed remote_port value

### Performance Impact:

The bug report correctly identifies that:
- Multiple accesses to `local_address` or `local_port` result in multiple system calls
- Multiple accesses to `remote_address` or `remote_port` use cached values with no additional system calls
- This creates an inconsistency where "local" attributes are more expensive to access than "remote" attributes

### Accuracy of Bug Report:

The bug report is technically accurate in its claims:
- The code behaves exactly as described
- The inconsistency exists between local and remote attribute caching
- The hypothesis test passes, confirming the behavior
- The suggested fix would make the behavior consistent
