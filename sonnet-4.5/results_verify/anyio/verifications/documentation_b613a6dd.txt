## Documentation Analysis for process_worker() Function

### Function Purpose
The `process_worker()` function is an internal implementation detail of anyio's worker process functionality. It is not part of the public API and is not documented in the official anyio documentation.

### Key Findings:

1. **No Public Documentation**: The function `process_worker()` is not mentioned in anyio's public API documentation. It's an internal function used by the `to_process.run_sync()` public API.

2. **Internal Implementation**: The function serves as the entry point for worker processes spawned by anyio to execute CPU-intensive functions in separate processes.

3. **Stdout/Stderr Redirection Purpose**: The code comment on lines 199-200 states:
   "Redirect standard streams to os.devnull so that user code won't interfere with the parent-worker communication"

   This indicates the redirection is intentional to prevent user code output from corrupting the communication protocol between parent and worker processes.

4. **Communication Protocol**: Based on the code and GitHub issue #516, anyio uses stdout/stderr for internal IPC (Inter-Process Communication) between parent and worker processes. The worker sends status messages like "READY", "RETURN", or "EXCEPTION" through stdout.

5. **Resource Management Expectations**: While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that file handles should be closed, Python's general best practices and resource management principles dictate that:
   - File handles opened with `open()` should be closed when no longer needed
   - The "with" statement or explicit close() calls should be used
   - Resource leaks should be avoided

6. **Related Documentation**: GitHub issue #516 confirms that "AnyIO uses the stdout/stderr of the worker processes for internal purposes to communicate with the parent process," but doesn't mention file handle management.

### Documentation Gap
The documentation does not specify:
- That process_worker() is expected to leak file handles
- Any rationale for not closing the devnull handles
- Whether this is intentional behavior or an oversight

Since this is an internal function and the leak violates general Python resource management principles without documented justification, this appears to be an implementation bug rather than intended behavior.
