## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation never explicitly states that float values should be accepted for total_tokens. The docstring only refers to "the total number of tokens" which could reasonably be interpreted as integer-only. The examples in the documentation only show integer values being used. The runtime validation clearly states the requirement and has been consistently enforcing int-only values, suggesting this is intentional design.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The type annotations explicitly and consistently use `float` throughout the codebase. Type hints are part of the public API contract in modern Python. If the intention was to only accept integers, the type hints should have been `int | float` or just `int`. The fact that `math.inf` (a float) is accepted shows that some float values are intended to work.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a minor inconsistency that likely affects very few users in practice. Most real-world use cases would use integer token counts. The validation has been in place and working, and changing it might break existing code that relies on the TypeError for validation. The semantic difference between 5 and 5.5 tokens is marginal and unlikely to matter in practice.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it's a clear contradiction between type annotations and runtime behavior. Type hints are increasingly important for IDE support, type checkers, and code documentation. Having incorrect type hints can lead to confusion and bugs in user code. The issue affects the core API of a synchronization primitive.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior (int-only) might be the intended design, and the type hints are simply wrong. Changing the type hints from `float` to `Union[int, float]` with a note that only `int` and `math.inf` are accepted would clarify the API. This would be the least disruptive fix that aligns documentation with actual behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The type hints are pervasive and consistent throughout the codebase, suggesting they were intentional. Simply documenting the current restrictive behavior doesn't address why float was chosen in the first place. If the type hints are wrong, they should be changed to `int`, not kept as `float` with a caveat.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting arbitrary float values could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The current code works as implemented, and adding float support would be an enhancement. This would involve relaxing the validation to accept all float values, which is adding new functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The type annotations already promise float support - this isn't asking for something new but rather asking for the implementation to match its declared interface. Features requests are for new capabilities, not for fixing inconsistencies between declared and actual behavior.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There is a clear, objective mismatch between the type annotations (`float`) and the runtime validation (only `int` or `math.inf`). The code would work correctly with float values - the comparison logic handles floats properly. Type annotations are part of the API contract, and violating them is a bug. The validation is artificially restrictive without technical justification.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The validation explicitly and intentionally checks for `int` type, with a clear error message. This suggests the restriction is by design, not oversight. The documentation examples only show integer usage. The semantic meaning of fractional tokens is questionable - what does 0.5 of a capacity token mean? The current behavior has been stable and working.

## Overall Consideration

This case presents a clear inconsistency between type annotations and runtime behavior. The type hints consistently declare `float` throughout multiple files and classes, while the runtime validation explicitly rejects float values except for `math.inf`. This creates confusion for users relying on type hints for API understanding.

However, the validation appears intentional with its explicit type check and clear error message. The restriction to integers (plus infinity) makes semantic sense for a "number of tokens" concept, as fractional tokens are conceptually unclear. The documentation examples only demonstrate integer usage, and there's no documented use case for fractional tokens.

The most likely explanation is that the type annotations use `float` to accommodate `math.inf` (which is technically a float), but the developers intended to restrict other values to integers. This is a documentation/type hint issue rather than a functional bug. The proper fix would be to clarify the type hints to properly express "int or math.inf" rather than the misleading `float`. Since Python's type system cannot easily express "int or specifically math.inf", the current state represents a compromise that should be better documented.

Given that the code works as apparently intended, the issue is best categorized as a DOCUMENTATION_FIX to clarify the type hints and add explicit documentation about acceptable values.
