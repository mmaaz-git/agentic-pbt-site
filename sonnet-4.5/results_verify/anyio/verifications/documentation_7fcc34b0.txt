Documentation Analysis
======================

1. Django Documentation:
   - No official Django documentation was found describing the expected behavior of limit_offset_sql
   - The method is not documented in Django's public API documentation
   - However, the method name lacks a leading underscore, suggesting it's a public API
   - The docstring in the source code (line 268) only says "Return LIMIT/OFFSET SQL clause" without specifying behavior for edge cases

2. Method Usage in Django:
   - The method is used internally by Django's SQL compiler (compiler.py:937-939)
   - The compiler calls it with self.query.low_mark and self.query.high_mark
   - The Query.set_limits() method (query.py:2148-2169) has protective logic at lines 2168-2169 that calls set_empty() when low_mark == high_mark
   - However, set_limits() doesn't prevent high_mark from being less than low_mark in all cases

3. SQL Standard Behavior:
   - PostgreSQL documentation doesn't explicitly document behavior for negative LIMIT values
   - Testing with SQLite shows it treats negative LIMIT as unlimited (not an error)
   - Different databases handle this differently - there's no consistent standard
   - The SQL standard expects LIMIT to be a non-negative integer

4. Method Signature Analysis:
   - _get_limit_offset_params is a "protected" method (single underscore prefix)
   - limit_offset_sql is a public method (no underscore prefix)
   - As a public API, it should handle invalid inputs gracefully

5. Documentation Gaps:
   - No documentation specifies what should happen when high_mark < low_mark
   - No documentation states whether negative LIMIT values are acceptable
   - The method doesn't document its preconditions or valid input ranges
   - There's no clear contract about who is responsible for input validation

Conclusion: The documentation is insufficient to determine the exact expected behavior when high_mark < low_mark. The method appears to be a public API that should handle edge cases, but the documentation doesn't specify how.
