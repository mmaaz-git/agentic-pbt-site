## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report is accurate and reproducible. Creating a MultiListener with another MultiListener as input unexpectedly mutates the input MultiListener by emptying its listeners list.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - Test failed with num_listeners=1 (and would fail with any positive value)
   - The assertion `assert len(multi1.listeners) == original_count` fails because multi1.listeners is emptied

2. **Manual Reproduction**:
   - Created multi1 with 2 listeners: [listener1, listener2]
   - After creating multi2 = MultiListener(listeners=[multi1]):
     - multi1.listeners becomes empty: []
     - multi2.listeners contains the flattened result: [listener1, listener2]
   - The original multi1 object has been mutated

### Source Code Analysis

In `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/anyio_env/stapled.py`, the MultiListener class's `__post_init__` method (lines 111-120):

```python
def __post_init__(self) -> None:
    listeners: list[Listener[T_Stream]] = []
    for listener in self.listeners:
        if isinstance(listener, MultiListener):
            listeners.extend(listener.listeners)
            del listener.listeners[:]  # Line 116 - THE PROBLEMATIC LINE
        else:
            listeners.append(listener)

    self.listeners = listeners
```

The issue is on line 116: `del listener.listeners[:]` which explicitly clears the listeners list of any nested MultiListener that is passed in. This modifies the input object in place, which is unexpected behavior for object construction.

### Impact

This mutation violates several important principles:
1. **Principle of least surprise**: Constructors shouldn't mutate their input arguments
2. **Object integrity**: The original multi1 object becomes unusable after being passed to multi2
3. **Potential for bugs**: Code that expects to reuse multi1 after passing it to another MultiListener will fail unexpectedly

The bug is real and the proposed fix (removing line 116) would resolve the issue without breaking the flattening functionality.
