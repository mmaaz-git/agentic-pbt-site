## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Clear incorrect behavior**: The method returns wrong data - bytes 5-9 instead of 0-4
2. **Violates interface contract**: Deviates from Python's io.BufferedIOBase documented behavior
3. **Inconsistent with stdlib**: Python's standard SpooledTemporaryFile works correctly
4. **Obvious coding error**: Missing return statement causes double-read
5. **Data corruption**: Silent data corruption is a serious issue
6. **Wrong method call**: readinto1() calls readinto() instead of readinto1()

**This is the strongest candidate** - The code has clear logic errors that cause incorrect behavior.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None. The bug is real and reproducible. The code clearly has missing return statements.

**Not INVALID** - The bug report accurately describes a real problem.

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Could argue it's an edge case if few users use readinto() methods
- Workaround exists (use read() instead of readinto())

**Unlikely to be WONTFIX** - This is core I/O functionality that silently corrupts data. Even if rarely used, data corruption bugs should be fixed.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- anyio docs don't explicitly promise readinto() compatibility

**Not DOCUMENTATION_FIX** - The code implements these methods, they just don't work correctly. This is a code bug, not a documentation issue.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue readinto() support was never properly implemented

**Not FEATURE_REQUEST** - The methods exist but are broken. This is a bug fix, not a new feature.

### Final Analysis

This is unequivocally a **BUG**:

1. **Clear logic error**: Missing return statements in both methods
2. **Wrong method call**: readinto1() calls wrong underlying method
3. **Data corruption**: Returns incorrect data silently
4. **Violates standard interface**: Deviates from io.BufferedIOBase contract
5. **High severity**: Core I/O functionality is broken
6. **Easy to fix**: Simple addition of return statements

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, and includes:
- Reproducible test cases
- Clear explanation of the issue
- Correct root cause analysis
- Appropriate fix

This should be categorized as BUG and fixed immediately given the data corruption potential.
