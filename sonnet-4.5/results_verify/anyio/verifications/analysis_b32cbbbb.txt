## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Category: BUG

**Why this is a BUG:**
1. **Type Contract Violation**: The function signature explicitly declares `max_buffer_size: float` but rejects most float values. This is a clear violation of the type contract.
2. **User Expectation**: Developers using type hints for IDE support, type checking (mypy), or documentation would expect any float value to work.
3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The function accepts `math.inf` (a float) but rejects other float values like `1.0` or `5.5`.
4. **Python Standards**: In Python's typing system, declaring a parameter as `float` means it should accept float values.

### Category: INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:** None. The type annotation creates an explicit contract that is being violated.

### Category: WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- One could argue that buffer sizes should logically be integers (whole number of items)
- However, the explicit `float` type annotation makes this a genuine bug, not a minor issue

### Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The docstring doesn't explicitly state type requirements
- However, the type annotation IS part of the documentation/API contract
- This would only be a documentation fix if the type hint was considered incorrect documentation

### Category: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue that accepting floats is a new feature
- However, the type annotation already promises this capability, so it's not a new feature but a bug

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function's type annotation creates an API contract that promises to accept float values, but the implementation violates this contract. This is not a documentation issue because type annotations are part of the API contract in modern Python. It's not a feature request because the capability is already promised by the type hint.

The fix should be one of:
1. Change the type annotation to `Union[int, float]` or just `int` to match implementation
2. Change the implementation to accept floats (converting them to ints as needed)

Either approach would resolve the contract violation, though changing the type annotation would be a breaking change for code that relies on the current (incorrect) type hint.
