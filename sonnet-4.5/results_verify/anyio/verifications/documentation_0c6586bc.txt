## Documentation Analysis

### What the Documentation Says

I reviewed the anyio documentation for socket attributes and found the following:

1. **SocketAttribute Class Documentation** (from source code docstrings):
   - `local_port`: Described as "for IP based sockets, the local port the underlying socket is bound to"
   - `remote_port`: Described as "for IP based sockets, the remote port the underlying socket is connected to"
   - Both are simply defined as `int` typed attributes
   - No specification about caching behavior or whether they should be dynamic or static

2. **Official Documentation (anyio.readthedocs.io)**:
   - The API documentation lists these attributes but provides no guidance on their implementation details
   - No mention of whether values are cached or dynamically retrieved
   - No specification about consistency between similar attributes

3. **TypedAttributeProvider Interface**:
   - The attributes are accessed through the `extra_attributes` property
   - Returns a mapping of attribute names to callables that return values
   - No documented contract about whether these callables should cache or re-compute values

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say

The documentation notably lacks:
1. **Caching Policy**: No specification of whether socket attributes should be cached or dynamic
2. **Consistency Requirements**: No requirement that similar attributes (local_port vs remote_port) should behave the same way
3. **Performance Considerations**: No guidance on whether system calls should be minimized
4. **Behavioral Contract**: No specification about what happens if the underlying socket state changes

### Socket Behavior Context

From general socket programming knowledge:
- TCP socket addresses (both local and remote) are fixed after connection establishment
- For connected sockets, neither the local port nor remote port can change during the socket's lifetime
- Both `getsockname()` and `getpeername()` return stable values for connected TCP sockets
- The only difference is that `getpeername()` fails if the socket isn't connected, while `getsockname()` works for bound sockets

### Conclusion

The documentation does not specify whether these attributes should be cached or dynamic. This is an implementation detail that is not covered by the public API contract. However, the inconsistent behavior between `local_port` and `remote_port` appears to be unintentional rather than by design, as:
1. There's no documented reason for the difference
2. Both attributes represent fundamentally similar information (port numbers)
3. For connected sockets, both values are equally stable
