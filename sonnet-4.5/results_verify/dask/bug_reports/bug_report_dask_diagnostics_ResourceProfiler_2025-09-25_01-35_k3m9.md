# Bug Report: dask.diagnostics.ResourceProfiler Type Mismatch in PID Comparison

**Target**: `dask.diagnostics.profile.ResourceProfiler._update_pids`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `_update_pids` method in `ResourceProfiler._Tracker` compares an integer PID with a Process object, causing the tracker process to never be filtered out from resource monitoring.

## Property-Based Test

While analyzing the code for property-based testing, I discovered a type mismatch in the PID comparison logic. The issue was found through static analysis of the code, not through a failing Hypothesis test.

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from multiprocessing import current_process

class MockProcess:
    def __init__(self, pid_value):
        self.pid = pid_value

    def status(self):
        return "running"

def buggy_update_pids(parent_children, pid):
    return [
        p for p in parent_children if p.pid != pid and p.status() != "zombie"
    ]

def fixed_update_pids(parent_children, pid):
    return [
        p for p in parent_children if p.pid != pid.pid and p.status() != "zombie"
    ]

tracker_process = current_process()
children = [
    MockProcess(12345),
    MockProcess(tracker_process.pid),
    MockProcess(67890),
]

buggy_result = buggy_update_pids(children, tracker_process)
print(f"Buggy version PIDs: {[p.pid for p in buggy_result]}")

fixed_result = fixed_update_pids(children, tracker_process)
print(f"Fixed version PIDs: {[p.pid for p in fixed_result]}")

assert tracker_process.pid in [p.pid for p in buggy_result]
assert tracker_process.pid not in [p.pid for p in fixed_result]
```

## Why This Is A Bug

In `dask/diagnostics/profile.py`, the `_Tracker.run()` method (line 261) calls `pid = current_process()`, which returns a `multiprocessing.Process` object, not an integer PID.

This `pid` is then passed to `_update_pids(pid)` on line 271, which compares it with `p.pid` (an integer) on line 252: `p.pid != pid`.

Since a Process object will never equal an integer, this comparison always evaluates to `True`, meaning the tracker process itself is never filtered out of the process list being monitored. This causes the ResourceProfiler to include its own resource usage in the measurements, which is incorrect.
