# Bug Report: dask.diagnostics ResourceProfiler Type Mismatch in PID Comparison

**Target**: `dask.diagnostics.profile._Tracker._update_pids`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

The `_Tracker` class in `ResourceProfiler` incorrectly compares integer PIDs to Process objects due to a type error on line 261, causing the tracker process to never be filtered out from resource monitoring, potentially inflating measurements.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from multiprocessing import current_process
from unittest.mock import Mock


@given(st.integers(min_value=1000, max_value=65535))
def test_update_pids_type_mismatch(tracker_pid):
    from dask.diagnostics.profile import _Tracker

    tracker = _Tracker()
    mock_parent = Mock()
    mock_child = Mock()
    mock_child.pid = tracker_pid
    mock_child.status.return_value = "running"
    mock_parent.children.return_value = [mock_child]
    tracker.parent = mock_parent

    proc_obj = current_process()
    result = tracker._update_pids(proc_obj)

    assert mock_child in result, "Bug: child always included because int != Process is always True"
```

**Failing input**: Any integer PID value

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from multiprocessing import current_process

proc = current_process()
child_pid = 12345

buggy_comparison = child_pid != proc
correct_comparison = child_pid != proc.pid

print(f"Buggy: {child_pid} != {proc} = {buggy_comparison}")
print(f"Correct: {child_pid} != {proc.pid} = {correct_comparison}")
```

Output:
```
Buggy: 12345 != <_MainProcess name='MainProcess' parent=None started> = True
Correct: 12345 != 1797259 = True
```

The first comparison always returns True because it compares an integer to a Process object.

## Why This Is A Bug

In `profile.py` line 261, `pid = current_process()` assigns a Process object instead of an integer PID. This causes line 252's comparison `p.pid != pid` to compare an integer (`p.pid`) to a Process object (`pid`), which is always `True` in Python.

The intended behavior is to filter out the tracker process itself from resource monitoring to avoid measuring the monitor's own overhead. However, this filtering never happens due to the type mismatch, potentially causing the tracker to include its own CPU and memory usage in the measurements.
