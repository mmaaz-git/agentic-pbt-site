DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR dask.dataframe.io.orc
=================================================

1. Official Documentation Review:
---------------------------------
I reviewed the official Dask documentation for read_orc and to_orc functions:

read_orc documentation:
- Function purpose: "Read dataframe from ORC file(s)"
- Returns: "Dask.DataFrame (even if there is only one column)"
- No explicit mention of how empty DataFrames should be handled
- No statement about round-trip guarantees
- No documentation about edge cases or limitations with empty files

to_orc documentation:
- Function purpose: "Store Dask.dataframe to ORC files"
- States: "Each partition will be written to a separate file"
- No explicit mention of behavior with empty DataFrames
- No warnings about empty DataFrames being problematic

2. Key Observations:
--------------------
- The documentation does NOT specify that empty DataFrames are unsupported
- The documentation does NOT warn users that empty ORC files cannot be read back
- There is no "Limitations" or "Known Issues" section mentioning empty DataFrames
- The documentation implies general-purpose DataFrame I/O without restrictions

3. Related Standards:
---------------------
- ORC is an Apache format that supports empty files (0 rows) as valid
- PyArrow (the default engine) successfully reads empty ORC files
- Pandas DataFrames support empty DataFrames as valid objects
- Dask DataFrames also support empty DataFrames as valid objects

4. Round-trip Expectations:
---------------------------
While the documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee round-trip behavior, it is a reasonable expectation for I/O operations that:
- If a write operation succeeds without error, the corresponding read operation should also succeed
- Data that can be written should be readable using the same format/library

5. Documentation Gaps:
----------------------
The documentation lacks:
- Explicit round-trip guarantees or disclaimers
- Edge case handling descriptions (empty files, single row, etc.)
- Behavior specifications for boundary conditions
- Clear error handling expectations

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation does not indicate that empty DataFrames are unsupported or should fail. The absence of warnings or limitations regarding empty DataFrames, combined with the successful write operation, suggests users would reasonably expect the read operation to work.
