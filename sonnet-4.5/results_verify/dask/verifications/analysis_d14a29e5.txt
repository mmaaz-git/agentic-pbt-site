## Bug Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report) - STRONG CASE
**Why this should be a BUG:**
1. **Docstring examples don't work**: ALL 5 examples in the docstring use plain Python lists, and every single one fails with TypeError
2. **Clear contract violation**: The docstring establishes that lists are the primary input type through its examples
3. **Obvious functionality**: A function called "sorted_division_locations" that takes a "sorted list" should naturally accept Python's most basic list type
4. **Easy fix available**: The bug report even provides a working fix that's just 3 lines
5. **User impact**: Anyone following the documentation will immediately encounter this error
6. **Inconsistent with Python conventions**: Functions that work with sequences typically accept lists

### INVALID - WEAK CASE
**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. This is an internal function (in io.io module), not part of the public API
2. The function might have been designed only for numpy/pandas types initially
3. The docstring might have been written carelessly with list syntax for brevity

**Counter-argument**: Even internal functions should have accurate docstrings, especially when they contain detailed examples.

### WONTFIX - WEAK CASE
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. It's an internal utility function that users shouldn't be calling directly
2. The main use cases might all involve numpy/pandas data

**Counter-argument**: If it's truly internal-only, the docstring shouldn't have user-facing examples. The existence of detailed examples suggests it's meant to be used.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - MODERATE CASE
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code works correctly for its intended inputs (numpy/pandas)
2. The docstring could be updated to show numpy array examples instead
3. The comment about "Convert from an ndarray" suggests arrays are the expected input

**Counter-argument**: Changing the docstring would be admitting the examples were wrong. But the simpler fix is to make the code match the documentation, not vice versa.

### FEATURE_REQUEST - WEAK CASE
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Adding list support could be seen as a new feature
2. The function was never designed to handle lists

**Counter-argument**: When ALL documentation examples use lists, supporting lists isn't a new feature - it's fixing broken functionality.

### FINAL ASSESSMENT

This is clearly a **BUG**. The docstring creates an explicit contract through its examples that the function accepts lists. Users following the documentation will immediately fail. The fact that it's easy to fix (just check if input is already a list) and that lists are the most basic Python sequence type makes this a straightforward bug, not a feature request or documentation issue.

The principle of least surprise applies: when documentation shows list examples, the function should accept lists. The bug report correctly identifies this as a contract violation between documentation and implementation.
