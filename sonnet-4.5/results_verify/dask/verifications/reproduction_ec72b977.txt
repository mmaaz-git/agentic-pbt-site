## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully reproduced the bug using both the specific test case and the hypothesis property-based test provided in the bug report.

### Specific Test Case Results
With the provided test case (hourly timestamps from 2000-01-01 00:00:00 to 2000-01-02 00:00:00, rule='D', closed='right', label='right'):
- **Actual output**: bin_divs has 3 elements, out_divs has 2 elements
- **Expected**: Both should have the same length
- **Result**: CONFIRMED - The bug exists as reported

### Hypothesis Test Results
Running 50 property-based test examples:
- **Failure rate**: 11 out of 50 examples failed
- **Failure pattern**: ALL failures occurred only with closed='right' and label='right'
- **Other combinations**: closed='left'/label='left', closed='left'/label='right', and closed='right'/label='left' all passed

### Root Cause Analysis
Through step-by-step debugging, I identified the exact issue in lines 92-101:

1. When `newdivs[-1] < divisions[-1]` and `len(newdivs) < len(divs)`:
   - The code always appends to `newdivs`
   - But only conditionally appends to `outdivs` based on comparison with `divisions[-1]`

2. In the failing case:
   - `newdivs` gets appended with `divisions[-1] + res`
   - `outdivs` is NOT appended because `outdivs[-1] == divisions[-1]`
   - This creates the length mismatch

### Usage Impact
The mismatched lengths cause problems in `ResampleAggregation._lower()` (lines 162-164):
- It creates `BlockwiseDep(output_divisions[:-1])` and `BlockwiseDep(output_divisions[1:])`
- With mismatched lengths, these create inconsistent partition boundaries
- The `_divisions()` method expects both tuples to work together

### Technical Correctness
The bug is technically valid:
1. The function returns two tuples that are meant to represent related division boundaries
2. The usage in `ResampleAggregation` clearly expects them to have compatible structures
3. The mismatch only occurs with specific parameter combinations (closed='right', label='right')
4. The bug is deterministic and reproducible

### Conclusion
The bug report is accurate and the reproduction confirms:
- The function does return mismatched lengths for bin_divs and out_divs
- This only happens with closed='right' and label='right' parameters
- The root cause is correctly identified in the conditional logic
- The impact on downstream code is real and could cause partition boundary issues
