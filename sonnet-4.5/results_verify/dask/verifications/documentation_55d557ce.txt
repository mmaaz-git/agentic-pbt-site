DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

FUNCTION SIGNATURE AND DOCUMENTATION:
The function _overlap_internal_chunks is an internal/private function (indicated by the leading underscore).

Documentation found:
- Docstring: "Get new chunks for array with overlap."
- No public API documentation exists for this function
- No type hints or return type specification in the docstring
- No specification about whether it should return tuples or lists

USAGE CONTEXT:
1. The function is used internally in overlap_internal() at line 75
2. The function is also implemented in dask/array/_array_expr/_overlap.py
3. In the _array_expr version, the result is explicitly normalized:
   `tuple(map(tuple, _overlap_internal_chunks(self.array.chunks, self.axes)))`

DASK CHUNKS CONVENTION:
- Dask arrays use tuples of tuples for chunks throughout the codebase
- The Array class expects chunks as tuple of tuples
- The Array constructor normalizes chunks to this format

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
1. This is an internal function (prefixed with underscore) with minimal documentation
2. No explicit contract about return types exists in the documentation
3. The _array_expr version suggests the intended output should be tuples
4. The Array class normalizes the output anyway, so the inconsistency doesn't cause runtime errors
5. The function is not part of the public API

DOCUMENTATION VERDICT:
There is no documentation that specifies what type this internal function should return. The lack of specification combined with it being an internal function means this is not a clear violation of documented behavior.
