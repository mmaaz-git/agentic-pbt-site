## Documentation Analysis

### Dask Documentation:
The Dask documentation for `DataFrame.rolling()` states:
- The `window` parameter can be: int, str (offset), or offset
- With a DatetimeIndex, offset aliases like '5D' can be used
- The `center` parameter is a boolean (default False) that "Sets the labels at the center of the window"
- No restrictions are mentioned about using string/timedelta windows with `center=True`

### Pandas Documentation:
The pandas documentation confirms:
- Time-based windows are fully supported: "If a timedelta, str, or offset, the time period of each window will be a variable sized based on the observations included in the time-period"
- The `center` parameter works with all window types to "set the window labels as the center of the window index"
- No restrictions on combining time-based windows with `center=True`

### API Compatibility Expectation:
Dask explicitly aims to provide a pandas-compatible API for DataFrames. From Dask's own documentation:
"Dask DataFrame implements a subset of the pandas DataFrame API using blocked algorithms"

### Empirical Testing:
I confirmed that pandas successfully handles `rolling(window='2h', center=True)` on datetime-indexed DataFrames:
- The operation completes without errors
- It produces different (correct) results compared to `center=False`
- This is clearly an intended, documented feature of pandas

### Conclusion:
The documentation supports the user's expectation that Dask should handle string/timedelta windows with `center=True` just as pandas does. There are no documented restrictions that would make this combination invalid. The failure is an implementation bug, not undefined or undocumented behavior.
