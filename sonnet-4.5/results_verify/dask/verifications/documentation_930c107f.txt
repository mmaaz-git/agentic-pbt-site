## Documentation Analysis for dask.utils.format_bytes

I have reviewed the source code and documentation for the `format_bytes` function in dask/utils.py. Here are my findings:

### Source Code Documentation
The function includes a docstring with examples and an explicit guarantee at the end:
```
For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters.
```

This is a clear, unambiguous statement in the docstring that forms part of the function's contract with users.

### External Documentation
The Dask documentation website also includes this same guarantee about the 10-character limit for values less than 2**60.

### Function Purpose
The function is designed to format byte counts as human-readable text with appropriate units (B, kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB). It uses binary prefixes (1024-based) rather than decimal prefixes (1000-based).

### Key Implementation Details
- The function iterates through prefixes from largest to smallest (PiB down to kiB)
- It uses a threshold of 0.9 * unit size to determine when to switch to a particular unit
- It formats numbers with 2 decimal places using `.2f` format specifier
- For values below 1024 * 0.9, it returns the value with " B" suffix

### Documentation Clarity
The documentation is clear and explicit about the 10-character guarantee. This is not an ambiguous statement or something that could be interpreted multiple ways. The function explicitly promises that for all inputs less than 2**60, the output string will be at most 10 characters long.
