## Documentation Analysis Report

### Function Documentation
The `apply_filters` function in `dask.dataframe.io.parquet.core` has the following docstring:

```python
def apply_filters(parts, statistics, filters):
    """Apply filters onto parts/statistics pairs

    Parameters
    ----------
    parts: list
        Tokens corresponding to row groups to read in the future
    statistics: List[dict]
        List of statistics for each part, including min and max values
    filters: Union[List[Tuple[str, str, Any]], List[List[Tuple[str, str, Any]]]]
        List of filters to apply, like ``[[('x', '=', 0), ...], ...]``. This
        implements partition-level (hive) filtering only, i.e., to prevent the
        loading of some row-groups and/or files.

        Predicates can be expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF). This means
        that the innermost tuple describes a single column predicate. These
        inner predicates are combined with an AND conjunction into a larger
        predicate. The outer-most list then combines all of the combined
        filters with an OR disjunction.

        Predicates can also be expressed as a List[Tuple]. These are evaluated
        as an AND conjunction. To express OR in predicates, one must use the
        (preferred) List[List[Tuple]] notation.

    Returns
    -------
    parts, statistics: the same as the input, but possibly a subset
    """
```

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **No explicit requirement for non-empty filters**: The documentation does not state that filters must be non-empty. The type annotation allows for a List, which can be empty in Python.

2. **Return value description**: The documentation states it returns "the same as the input, but possibly a subset". This implies that with no filters, it should return all inputs unchanged.

3. **Dask read_parquet documentation**: The public API documentation for `read_parquet` mentions filters but does not explicitly state whether empty filters are allowed or not.

4. **Arrow engine behavior**: The Arrow engine's internal `_filters_to_expression` function considers empty filters as "Malformed filters", but this is an implementation detail not exposed in public documentation.

5. **Inconsistency in handling**: The higher-level `read_parquet` function successfully handles empty filters (by converting them to None), while the lower-level `apply_filters` crashes.

### Related Code Patterns

1. The Arrow engine protects against empty filters:
   - Line 1701: `filter=_filters_to_expression(filters) if filters else None`
   - This treats empty list as falsy and substitutes None

2. The `_filters_to_expression` function explicitly rejects empty filters:
   - Line 374-375: Raises ValueError("Malformed filters") for empty filters

3. Other parts of the codebase check for filter existence:
   - Line 336: `if filters else set()`
   - Line 1290: `if filters is not None:`
   - Line 1344: `if filters is not None:`

### Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation does not specify what constitutes valid vs. invalid filter inputs
2. The documentation does not state whether empty filters are allowed
3. The documentation does not specify the behavior for edge cases (empty list, None, etc.)

### Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly forbid empty filters, and the natural interpretation of "apply filters" with an empty filter list would be to return all data unfiltered. The fact that `read_parquet` (the public API) handles empty filters successfully suggests this is expected behavior. The crash in `apply_filters` appears to be an oversight rather than intentional design.
