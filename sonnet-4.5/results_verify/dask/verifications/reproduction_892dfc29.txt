## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### 1. The Bug Is Real

The specific example from the bug report is confirmed:
- Input: n = 1125894277343089729
- Condition: n < 2**60 ✓ (True)
- Output: '1000.00 PiB'
- Output length: 11 characters
- Expected (per docstring): <= 10 characters
- **Result: BUG CONFIRMED**

### 2. Mathematical Verification

The mathematical claims in the bug report are accurate:
- 1000 * 2**50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624,000
- 2**60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976
- 1000 * 2**50 < 2**60 is TRUE
- Values from 1000 * 2**50 to 2**60-1 all violate the 10-character limit

### 3. Systematic Testing

My testing revealed the exact boundary where the bug occurs:
- Values < 1000 PiB format correctly within 10 characters
  - "999.99 PiB" = 10 characters ✓
- Values >= 1000 PiB exceed 10 characters
  - "1000.00 PiB" = 11 characters ✗
  - "1023.00 PiB" = 11 characters ✗
  - "1024.00 PiB" = 11 characters ✗

### 4. Root Cause

The implementation formats values with 2 decimal places:
```python
return f"{n / k:.2f} {prefix}B"
```

This means:
- Values < 10 PiB: "X.XX PiB" = 8 characters
- Values 10-99 PiB: "XX.XX PiB" = 9 characters
- Values 100-999 PiB: "XXX.XX PiB" = 10 characters
- Values >= 1000 PiB: "XXXX.XX PiB" = 11+ characters

The docstring claim "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters" is violated for values >= 1000 * 2**50 (which are still < 2**60).

### 5. Impact Assessment

This is a genuine documentation/implementation mismatch. The docstring makes an explicit promise that the implementation does not fulfill. Code that relies on this 10-character guarantee (for formatting tables, fixed-width displays, etc.) could experience layout issues with large values.
