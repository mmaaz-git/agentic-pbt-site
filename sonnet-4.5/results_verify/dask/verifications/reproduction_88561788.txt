## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for `dask.diagnostics.profile_visualize.unquote`.

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction

The provided Hypothesis test successfully identified the bug. Running the test revealed two distinct failures:
1. A `TypeError` for expression `(set, [(list, [])])` - unhashable type issue
2. An `IndexError` for expression `(dict, [])` - the reported bug

The IndexError occurs exactly as described in the bug report, with the error message "list index out of range" at line 33 of profile_visualize.py.

### Minimal Example Reproduction

The minimal reproduction case `(dict, [])` raises an IndexError as reported:
- Error occurs at line 33 in `unquote` function
- The function tries to access `expr[1][0]` when `expr[1]` is an empty list
- This causes an IndexError: list index out of range

### Validation of Task Expression

I verified that `(dict, [])` is a valid Dask task expression:
- `dask.core.istask((dict, []))` returns `True`
- `dask.get({'x': (dict, [])}, 'x')` successfully returns an empty dictionary `{}`
- This confirms that creating an empty dictionary via `(dict, [])` is a legitimate Dask operation

### Code Analysis

The bug occurs in the condition checking on line 33:
```python
elif (
    expr[0] == dict
    and isinstance(expr[1], list)
    and isinstance(expr[1][0], list)  # BUG: assumes expr[1] is non-empty
):
```

The function correctly handles other collection types (tuple, list, set) in lines 28-29, but the dict handling has a special case that assumes the list is non-empty before checking `expr[1][0]`.

The bug is confirmed and the proposed fix of adding `len(expr[1]) > 0` before accessing `expr[1][0]` would resolve the issue.
