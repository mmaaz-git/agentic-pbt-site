DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Source Code Documentation

The function `format_bytes` in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py` has a docstring that explicitly states:

```python
"""Format bytes as text
[... examples ...]
For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters.
"""
```

This is a clear, unambiguous constraint documented directly in the function's docstring at line 1788.

## Official Documentation

The Dask official documentation at https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/api.html#dask.utils.format_bytes confirms:
- The function converts byte counts to human-readable strings
- It guarantees that output is always <= 10 characters for values < 2^60
- This constraint is presented as a feature/guarantee of the function

## Documentation Assessment

1. **Clarity**: The constraint is clearly stated in both the docstring and official documentation
2. **Specificity**: The constraint is specific - "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters"
3. **Intent**: This appears to be an intentional design constraint, likely for formatting consistency
4. **No Ambiguity**: There is no ambiguity about what this constraint means

## Conclusion

The documentation makes an explicit, unambiguous promise about the maximum output length for values less than 2**60. This is not an implied behavior or a side effect - it's a documented guarantee of the function. The fact that the function violates this documented constraint for valid inputs (values >= 1000 * 2**50 but < 2**60) represents a clear discrepancy between the documented behavior and actual behavior.

The documentation is not vague or unclear - it makes a specific mathematical claim that can be (and has been) tested and found to be false.
