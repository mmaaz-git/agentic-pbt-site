## Documentation Analysis for dask.utils.format_bytes

### Official Documentation Found:

1. **Function Docstring (from source code):**
   - The docstring explicitly states: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
   - This is a clear, unambiguous guarantee about the function's behavior
   - The guarantee appears both in the installed package and in the GitHub repository

2. **Function Purpose:**
   - Formats byte values as human-readable text
   - Uses binary prefixes (kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB)
   - Automatically selects appropriate unit for readability

3. **Documentation Sources Reviewed:**
   - Official Dask documentation
   - GitHub source code repository
   - Function docstring in the actual implementation
   - API reference documentation

### Key Finding:

The documentation **explicitly guarantees** that for all values less than 2**60, the output will always be 10 characters or less. This is not an implicit assumption or undocumented behavior - it's a clearly stated contract in the function's docstring.

### Relevance to Bug Report:

The bug report correctly identifies that this documented guarantee is violated. The value 1125894277343089729 is less than 2**60, but produces an 11-character output ('1000.00 PiB'), which directly contradicts the documented behavior.

This is not a case of:
- Undefined behavior
- Ambiguous documentation
- Missing documentation
- Implementation-defined behavior

The documentation makes a specific, testable claim that the implementation fails to uphold.
