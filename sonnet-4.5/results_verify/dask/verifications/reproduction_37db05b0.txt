REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in dask.utils.key_split.

Test Results:
-------------
1. Hypothesis Test: CONFIRMED
   - The property-based test with @given(st.binary()) fails with b'\x80'
   - Error: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte

2. Direct Reproduction: CONFIRMED
   - key_split(b'\x80') raises UnicodeDecodeError as reported
   - The exact error message matches the bug report

3. Additional Testing:
   - Valid UTF-8 bytes work correctly: key_split(b'hello-world-1') returns 'hello-world'
   - Valid non-ASCII UTF-8 also works: key_split(b'\xc3\xa9') returns 'Ã©'
   - Multiple invalid UTF-8 sequences fail:
     * b'\x80' - invalid start byte
     * b'\xc3\x28' - invalid UTF-8 sequence
     * b'\xff\xfe' - invalid UTF-8 (BOM-like bytes)

4. Function Behavior Observations:
   - The function returns "Other" for None and unparseable inputs
   - The function has a try/except block that catches exceptions and returns "Other"
   - However, the bytes decoding happens OUTSIDE the try block at line 1979
   - This means UnicodeDecodeError is not caught by the general exception handler

The bug is real and reproducible. The function crashes with UnicodeDecodeError when given
non-UTF-8 byte sequences, despite having a general exception handler that returns "Other"
for other error cases.
