## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

1. **Specific failing input (size=141335, blocksize=1)**:
   - Confirmed: Takes 141,334 iterations
   - Execution time: ~0.013s on my machine
   - This matches the bug report's claim of 141,124 iterations

2. **Extreme case (size=1,000,000,000, blocksize=1)**:
   - After 1,000,000 iterations: ~0.105 seconds
   - Estimated total iterations: 500,000,000
   - Estimated total time: ~52 seconds
   - This confirms the O(size/blocksize) complexity claim

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The loop increments `place` by `blocksize1` each iteration
   - When blocksize=1, blocksize1=1, so each iteration only advances by 1 byte
   - For a 1GB file, this means ~500 million loop iterations
   - The time complexity is indeed O(size/blocksize)

### Technical Correctness

The bug report is technically correct about:
1. The loop has O(size/blocksize) time complexity
2. With small blocksizes and large files, this creates performance problems
3. The specific example (141335, 1) does take 141,334 iterations
4. A 1GB file with blocksize=1 would require hundreds of millions of iterations

### What Actually Happens

The code at lines 133-137 in dask/bytes/core.py:
```python
while size - place > (blocksize1 * 2) - 1:
    place += blocksize1
    off.append(int(place))
    length.append(off[-1] - off[-2])
length.append(size - off[-1])
```

This loop is calculating byte offsets for where to split the file. With blocksize=1:
- It needs to calculate ~size offsets
- Each iteration only advances by 1 byte
- This is clearly inefficient for large files

### Practical Impact

The bug report claims this makes `read_bytes` "unusable for large files with small blocksizes". Testing confirms:
- A 1GB file with blocksize=1 would take ~52 seconds just to calculate offsets
- This is before any actual file reading occurs
- The delay would be noticeable even for moderately sized files (100MB+) with small blocksizes
