## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug and investigated the underlying behavior. Here are my findings:

### Reproduction Results

1. **Basic Multi-Partition Test:** CONFIRMED - The bug occurs as reported
   - Original index: [0, 1, 2, 3]
   - Result index: [0, 1, 0, 1]
   - Each partition resets its index to start from 0

2. **Custom Index Test:** CONFIRMED - Custom index values are completely lost
   - Original index: [100, 200, 300, 400]
   - Result index: [0, 1, 0, 1]
   - Custom index values are not preserved

3. **Single Partition Test:** WORKS CORRECTLY
   - Original index: [0, 1, 2, 3]
   - Result index: [0, 1, 2, 3]
   - When using a single partition, the index is preserved

4. **Hypothesis Testing:** Multiple failures confirmed across random test cases

### Technical Investigation

When examining the ORC files directly, I discovered:

1. **Index IS Written to ORC Files:**
   - With `write_index=True`, the index is stored as a regular column in the ORC file
   - Named indexes (e.g., 'my_index') are stored with their column name
   - Each partition file contains the correct index values for its portion of data

2. **The Problem is in Reading:**
   - When reading with `dd.read_orc()` without specifying an index column, Dask creates a new RangeIndex for each partition starting from 0
   - The original index column is read as a regular data column, not as the index

3. **Workaround Exists:**
   - If you know the index column name, you can specify it: `dd.read_orc(path, index='my_index')`
   - This correctly restores the original index values
   - However, this requires knowing the index column name in advance

### Key Finding

The bug is NOT that the index isn't written to the ORC file - it is. The bug is that:

1. For unnamed indexes (default RangeIndex), there's no way to automatically restore them
2. The index is saved as a column named '__index_level_0__' or similar for unnamed indexes
3. `read_orc()` doesn't automatically detect and restore this index column
4. Each partition gets a fresh RangeIndex starting from 0, causing the reported issue

### Verification

The behavior is consistent and reproducible:
- Multi-partition writes with `write_index=True` save the index as a column
- Reading back without specifying the index column creates new per-partition indexes
- This causes data misalignment and violates the expected round-trip property

The bug report's claim is technically correct: writing with `write_index=True` and reading back does NOT preserve index values automatically, which is unexpected behavior and could lead to data corruption in operations that depend on index alignment.
