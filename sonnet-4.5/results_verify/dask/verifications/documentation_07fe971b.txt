DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing the dask.bytes.read_bytes documentation:

1. **Function Docstring**: The docstring in the source code (lines 24-79) describes:
   - The blocksize parameter as "Chunk size in bytes, defaults to '128 MiB'"
   - The function "cleanly breaks data by a delimiter if given"
   - Returns "blocks of bytes" from files
   - No explicit specification about whether offsets should be integers or floats

2. **Parameter Types**: The docstring specifies blocksize as "int, str" which strongly implies that blocksize values should be integers (after parsing strings like "128 MiB").

3. **Semantic Expectations**:
   - The term "bytes" inherently implies integer units
   - The parameter type "int" for blocksize implies integer arithmetic
   - Standard file I/O operations use integer byte offsets
   - Python's file.seek() and file.read() expect integer positions

4. **Missing Documentation**:
   - No explicit statement about how blocksize adjustment is performed
   - No documentation about the "shrink blocksize to give same number of parts" logic
   - No specification about whether floating-point arithmetic is intentionally used

5. **Type Convention**: In Python and file I/O operations:
   - Byte positions, offsets, and sizes are conventionally integers
   - Using float division for byte calculations violates this convention
   - The fsspec library (which dask uses) expects integer offsets

6. **Code Comment**: The comment at line 123 says "shrink blocksize to give same number of parts" but doesn't specify that this should use float arithmetic.

The documentation does not explicitly state that byte offsets must be integers, but this is a fundamental assumption in all file I/O operations. The use of float division appears to be an implementation detail that violates standard conventions rather than a documented feature.
