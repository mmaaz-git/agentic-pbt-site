## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The test results confirm:

1. **Bug Reproduction Confirmed**: The Node.__copy__() method does share the same list object between the original and the copy.
   - `copied.children is node.children` returns True
   - Mutations to the original node's children affect the copied node
   - The hypothesis test fails as reported

2. **Python's Copy Semantics - Critical Distinction**:
   - For built-in compound types (list, dict, deque, etc.), `copy.copy()` creates NEW container objects
   - For user-defined objects WITHOUT `__copy__`, Python shares attribute references
   - For user-defined objects WITH `__copy__`, the convention is to follow built-in behavior

3. **Standard Library Convention**:
   - All Python standard library compound types create NEW containers on shallow copy:
     - `list`: creates new list, shares elements
     - `dict`: creates new dict, shares values
     - `deque`: creates new deque, shares elements
     - `OrderedDict`: creates new dict, shares values
     - `array.array`: creates new array
   - This establishes the convention for container-like objects

4. **Django's Implementation**:
   - The current __copy__ implementation explicitly shares the children list
   - There's a comment indicating this is intentional: "Don't [:] as .__init__() via .create() does"
   - However, this violates the established convention for container-like objects
   - The __deepcopy__ method correctly creates a new list with deepcopy

5. **Why This Is Indeed a Bug**:
   - Node acts as a container for children (has __len__, __contains__, __bool__ based on children)
   - Standard Python convention for containers is to create new container objects on shallow copy
   - The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise
   - The bug report is CORRECT in identifying this as a violation of expected semantics

### Conclusion

The bug report is accurate. While Django's implementation includes a comment suggesting the behavior is intentional, it violates the established Python convention that container-like objects should create new containers (not share them) during shallow copy. This can lead to unexpected mutations propagating between supposedly independent copies.
