## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Results
I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report:

1. **Docstring example test**: The example from the function's own docstring (`L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`) fails with `TypeError: No dispatch for <class 'list'>`

2. **Integer list test**: A simple integer list also fails with the same error

3. **Minimal case**: The minimal case `sorted_division_locations([0], chunksize=1)` fails identically

4. **Hypothesis property test**: The property-based test also fails consistently

### Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs at line 284 of `/dask/dataframe/io/io.py`:
```python
seq = tolist(seq)
```

The function unconditionally calls `tolist()` on the input sequence. The `tolist` function uses a type dispatcher that has registrations for:
- `np.ndarray`
- `pd.Series`
- `pd.Index`
- `pd.Categorical`
- `cupy.ndarray` (optional)

But NO registration exists for plain Python lists. When a list is passed as input, `tolist` raises `TypeError: No dispatch for <class 'list'>`.

### Documentation vs Implementation Mismatch
The function's docstring contains 5 examples, ALL of which use plain Python lists as input:
- Lines 262-264: `L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']` with chunksize=2
- Lines 266-267: Same list with chunksize=3
- Lines 269-274: `L = ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C']` examples
- Lines 276-277: `['A']` with chunksize=2

These documented examples cannot possibly work with the current implementation, as they all would trigger the TypeError. The function is fundamentally broken for the exact use cases shown in its own documentation.
