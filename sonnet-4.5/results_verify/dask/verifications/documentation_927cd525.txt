## Documentation Analysis for sorted_division_locations

The `sorted_division_locations` function is defined in `/dask/dataframe/io/io.py`. Based on my examination of the code:

### Function Docstring
The function's docstring (lines 256-278) explicitly documents several examples using plain Python lists as input:
- `L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']` with various chunksizes
- All examples show plain Python lists being passed to the function
- The docstring states "Find division locations and values in sorted list"

### Function Implementation
The implementation (starting at line 279) shows:
1. Lines 284-287: The function checks if the input is already a list. If it's a list, it passes through unchanged. Otherwise, it calls `tolist(seq)` to convert it.
2. The `tolist` function is a dispatcher defined in `/dask/dataframe/dispatch.py`
3. The `tolist_dispatch` is only registered for: `np.ndarray`, `pd.Series`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Categorical`, and optionally `cupy.ndarray`
4. There is NO registration for plain Python lists in the tolist dispatcher

### Contract Violation
The docstring examples explicitly show the function being used with plain Python lists, but when a non-list is passed, the code tries to convert it using `tolist()`. Since lists themselves aren't registered with the tolist dispatcher, if the code path somehow ended up calling tolist on a list (which shouldn't happen based on the if-else at lines 284-287), it would fail.

However, looking more carefully at the code logic:
- If `seq` is a list, it skips the tolist call (line 285: pass)
- If `seq` is NOT a list, it calls tolist(seq) (line 287)

This means plain Python lists SHOULD work fine, as they bypass the tolist dispatcher entirely. The bug report may be incorrect about the actual error source.
