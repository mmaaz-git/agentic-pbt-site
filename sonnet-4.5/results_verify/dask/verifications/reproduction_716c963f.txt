Reproduction Analysis for sorted_columns Bug
=============================================

Bug Reproduction Results:

1. EXACT REPRODUCTION - CONFIRMED
   The bug report's test case reproduces exactly as described:
   - Input: statistics=[{"columns": [{"name": "0", "min": "00", "max": "0"}]}]
   - Result: AssertionError at line 442 in sorted_columns
   - Cause: '00' > '0' lexicographically, creating unsorted divisions ['00', '0']

2. ADDITIONAL TEST CASES - ALL REPRODUCE
   The bug occurs in multiple scenarios:

   a) String values where min > max lexicographically:
      - min='00', max='0' → AssertionError
      - min='d', max='c' → AssertionError

   b) Numeric values where min > max numerically:
      - min=10, max=5 → AssertionError

   c) Multiple row groups with any having min > max:
      - Even if first row group is valid, invalid second row group causes crash

3. HYPOTHESIS TEST - CONFIRMS BUG
   The property-based test from the bug report successfully finds multiple failing cases
   The test correctly identifies that the function crashes when divisions aren't sorted

4. REAL PARQUET FILES - NEVER HAVE THIS ISSUE
   Testing with actual Parquet files created by pyarrow shows:
   - Real statistics always have min <= max
   - This is because min/max are computed from actual data
   - When we manually corrupt real statistics to have min > max, the same crash occurs

5. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
   The function's algorithm assumes:
   - Within each row group: min <= max (NOT VALIDATED)
   - Across row groups: checks if next_min >= prev_max for sorting

   When min > max within a row group:
   - Divisions list gets [min, max] where min > max
   - This violates the sorted property
   - The assertion fails

6. TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS
   The bug report is technically accurate:
   - The code does crash with AssertionError
   - The crash occurs exactly where stated (line 442)
   - The cause is correctly identified (unsorted divisions due to min > max)

The bug is 100% reproducible and the technical details in the report are correct.
