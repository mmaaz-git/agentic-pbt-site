## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report) - Arguments For:
1. **Unexpected Mutation**: The function mutates its input parameter without documentation, violating Python's principle of least surprise.
2. **Reproducible**: The bug is consistently reproducible with both property-based tests and simple examples.
3. **Convention Violation**: Python strongly discourages mutating input parameters unless explicitly documented.
4. **Potential for Subtle Bugs**: Callers who reuse the columns list after calling this function will experience unexpected behavior.
5. **Easy Fix Available**: The suggested fix (copying the list before mutation) is simple and preserves the intended functionality.
6. **No Performance Justification**: There's no apparent performance reason to mutate in place vs. creating a copy.

### INVALID - Arguments Against:
1. **Internal Function**: `_read_orc` is marked as internal/private with a leading underscore.
2. **Caller Protection**: The public `read_orc` function does create a new list in some cases (when index is in columns).
3. **Could argue it's implementation detail**: Since it's internal, one could argue the behavior is an implementation detail.

However, this argument is weak because:
- The public API still passes user lists directly to this function in some cases
- Internal functions should still follow good practices
- The bug affects the public API's behavior

### WONTFIX - Arguments Against:
1. **Not Trivial**: This is not an obscure edge case - it affects normal usage patterns.
2. **User Impact**: The bug can cause real issues for users who reuse their columns lists.
3. **Easy to Fix**: The fix is trivial and low-risk.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments Against:
1. **Not a Documentation Issue**: The code behavior is incorrect, not just poorly documented.
2. **Documenting Bad Behavior**: We shouldn't document that the function mutates parameters - we should fix it.
3. **Against Conventions**: Even with documentation, mutating input parameters goes against Python conventions.

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments Against:
1. **Not a New Feature**: This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality.
2. **Bug Fix**: The expected behavior (not mutating input) already exists conceptually - the implementation is just wrong.

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Violates Python Conventions**: Functions should not mutate their parameters without clear documentation and good reason.

2. **Affects Public API**: While `_read_orc` is internal, it's called from the public `read_orc` function, and the mutation affects user-provided data.

3. **Causes Real Issues**: Users who pass a columns list and then reuse it will experience unexpected behavior.

4. **Simple Fix**: The proposed fix (copying before mutation) is straightforward and maintains all intended functionality.

5. **No Justification for Current Behavior**: There's no performance or design reason to mutate in place rather than copy.

The fact that this is an internal function does not excuse the behavior, especially since it's called directly from public API functions with user data.
