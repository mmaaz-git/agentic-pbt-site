REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the reported bug using both the hypothesis test and manual examples provided in the bug report.

## Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The test failed as expected when comparing Dask and pandas results
   - Error: "DataFrame.index values are different (50.0%)"
   - Dask produced index [0, 0] while pandas produced [0, 1]

2. **Manual Reproduction**:
   - With 2 rows and 2 partitions:
     * Pandas: Index [0, 1]
     * Dask: Index [0, 0]

   - With 6 rows and 3 partitions:
     * Pandas: Index [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     * Dask: Index [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

## Observed Behavior

The bug is confirmed. When `reset_index(drop=True)` is called on a Dask DataFrame with multiple partitions:
- Each partition independently resets its index starting from 0
- This results in duplicate index values across the DataFrame
- The pattern shows that each partition gets its own [0, 1, ...] sequence

## Impact

The effect is that:
1. The resulting DataFrame has duplicate index values
2. This differs significantly from pandas behavior
3. Operations that rely on unique indices would fail
4. The DataFrame violates the expectation of having a sequential, unique index after reset_index(drop=True)

The bug report's description accurately captures the issue.
