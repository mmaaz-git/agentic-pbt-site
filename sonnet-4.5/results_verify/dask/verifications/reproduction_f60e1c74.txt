BUG REPRODUCTION AND VERIFICATION

## Test Results

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. **Exact Bug Reproduction - CONFIRMED**
   - Created a DataFrame with one row: `pd.DataFrame({'a': [0], 'b': [0.0]})`
   - Created Dask DataFrame with 1 partition using `sort=False`
   - Attempted to repartition from 1 to 2 partitions
   - Result: AssertionError occurred exactly as reported
   - Traceback matches the report: AssertionError at line 192 in `_repartition.py`

2. **Additional Testing Results**
   - The bug occurs with both `sort=False` AND `sort=True` for single-row DataFrames
   - The bug does NOT occur when there's sufficient data (tested with 10 rows)
   - Reducing partitions (2 to 1) works correctly
   - The issue is specifically when trying to increase partitions with insufficient data

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   The error occurs in the `RepartitionToFewer` class at this line:
   ```python
   assert npartitions_input > npartitions
   ```

   The problem is that:
   - User requests to go from 1 partition to 2 partitions (increasing)
   - But the code incorrectly routes to `RepartitionToFewer` class
   - `RepartitionToFewer` expects to reduce partitions, not increase them
   - The assertion fails because 1 (input) is not > 2 (requested output)

4. **Code Path Issue**
   In the `_lower()` method at line 89, the decision logic is:
   ```python
   if self.new_partitions < self.frame.npartitions:
       return RepartitionToFewer(...)
   ```

   However, with unknown divisions and small data, this logic appears to be flawed. The system seems to be incorrectly calculating or routing the operation.

## Technical Accuracy

The bug report is technically accurate in all its claims:
1. The AssertionError does occur as stated
2. The traceback is correct
3. The code location is accurate
4. The issue is specific to small DataFrames with unknown divisions
