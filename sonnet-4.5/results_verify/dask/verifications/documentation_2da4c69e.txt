Function: dask.dataframe.utils._maybe_sort

Documentation Status:
- No public documentation exists for _maybe_sort
- The underscore prefix (_) indicates this is an internal/private function
- Not part of the public API - no imports of this function found elsewhere

Context and Usage:
- _maybe_sort is only used within dask.dataframe.utils module
- Called by the assert_eq function (lines 565-566) which is a testing utility
- assert_eq itself is primarily used for internal testing, though there's discussion about making it public (GitHub issue #2694)

Related Documentation:
- GitHub issue #9018 confirms that assert_eq sorts inputs when comparing dataframes
- This sorting behavior is known to potentially mask issues in tests
- The sorting is meant to help with comparison but has unintended side effects

Key Findings:
1. This is an internal utility function with no documented behavior contract
2. No documentation specifies whether index names should be preserved or modified
3. The function's only comment is "# sort by value, then index" which doesn't mention index name handling
4. The parent function assert_eq has known issues with its sorting behavior that can mask bugs

Conclusion:
Since this is an internal function with no documented behavior specification regarding index name preservation, the bug report's assumption that index names should be preserved is reasonable based on:
- The principle of least surprise
- The temporary nature implied by renaming for sorting purposes
- The fact that this is a utility function that shouldn't have visible side effects
