## Documentation Analysis for dask.bag.chunk variance functions

### Function Signatures
The functions in question have minimal documentation:
- `var_chunk(seq)` - No docstring provided
- `var_aggregate(x, ddof)` - No docstring provided

### Usage Context
These functions are used by `dask.bag.Bag.var()` method which computes variance of a Bag collection:
- The `var()` method calls `reduction()` with `var_chunk` as the per-partition function and `var_aggregate` as the aggregate function
- The `ddof` parameter stands for "degrees of freedom" and is a standard statistical parameter for variance calculation

### Expected Behavior
Based on the context and mathematical definition of variance:
1. Variance is mathematically defined as the average of squared deviations from the mean
2. By definition, variance MUST be non-negative (as it's the average of squared values)
3. When all values are identical, the variance MUST be exactly zero
4. The formula Var(X) = E[X²] - E[X]² is mathematically correct but known to be numerically unstable

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not explicitly specify:
- The numerical stability requirements or guarantees
- The specific algorithm to be used (naive vs numerically stable)
- Expected behavior for edge cases like large values or small variances

However, given that variance has a well-defined mathematical meaning, certain properties are inherent:
- Variance cannot be negative (this is a mathematical impossibility)
- Identical values must have zero variance (by definition)

### Conclusion
While the documentation is sparse, the mathematical definition of variance provides clear expectations that the current implementation violates by producing negative variances and non-zero variances for identical values.
