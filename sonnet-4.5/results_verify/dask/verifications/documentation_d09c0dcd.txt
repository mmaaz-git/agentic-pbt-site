## Documentation Analysis for dask.sizeof

### Official Documentation Review

I reviewed the official Dask documentation and found:

1. **Purpose of sizeof**: The documentation states that sizeof is used "to determine which objects to spill to disk" and for memory management. It's a critical component of Dask's worker memory management system.

2. **Extension Mechanism**: The documentation focuses on how users can extend sizeof for custom objects using the registration mechanism, but does not specify behavioral expectations.

3. **No Mention of Determinism**: The documentation does NOT explicitly state whether sizeof should be deterministic or non-deterministic.

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No Behavioral Contract**: The documentation doesn't specify that sizeof should return the same value for the same input across multiple calls.

2. **No Mention of Sampling**: The documentation doesn't mention that sizeof uses random sampling for large collections, which is a significant implementation detail that affects behavior.

3. **No Performance Trade-offs Documented**: The documentation doesn't explain that there's a trade-off between accuracy and performance for large collections.

### Implicit Expectations

While not explicitly documented, there are strong implicit expectations:

1. **Size Functions are Typically Deterministic**: In programming, functions that measure properties of immutable data (like size) are generally expected to be deterministic unless explicitly stated otherwise. Examples:
   - Python's `sys.getsizeof()` is deterministic
   - `len()` is deterministic
   - File size queries are deterministic

2. **Memory Management Requires Consistency**: Since sizeof is used for memory management decisions (when to spill to disk), non-deterministic behavior could lead to:
   - Inconsistent spilling decisions
   - Difficulty debugging memory issues
   - Unpredictable performance characteristics

3. **Testing and Debugging**: Non-deterministic functions are harder to test and debug, which goes against general software engineering principles.

### Related Documentation

The Dask documentation mentions "deterministic" behavior in other contexts:
- Tokenization can be configured for deterministic behavior
- Random sampling functions can accept seeds for deterministic results
- This suggests Dask values deterministic behavior where appropriate

### Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise deterministic behavior for sizeof, the lack of any warning about non-deterministic behavior, combined with the function's role in critical memory management decisions, strongly suggests that deterministic behavior is the expected and correct behavior. The current non-deterministic implementation appears to be an unintended side effect of the optimization strategy rather than a deliberate design choice.
