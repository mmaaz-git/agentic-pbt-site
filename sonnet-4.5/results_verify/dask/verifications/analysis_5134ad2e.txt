## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluating as BUG
**Arguments for:**
- The docstring makes an explicit, testable guarantee: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters"
- The function demonstrably violates this guarantee for valid inputs (1000 * 2**50 <= n < 2**60)
- The bug is reproducible and affects a documented property of the function
- The violation occurs for reasonable inputs within the specified range

**Arguments against:**
- The affected range is relatively small (only ~2.3% of the valid range)
- Most practical use cases unlikely to encounter values >= 1000 PiB

**Verdict:** This IS a valid bug - the code violates its explicit documented contract.

### Evaluating as WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- Values >= 1000 PiB are extremely rare in practice (1 PiB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes)
- The violation is minor (11 vs 10 characters) and doesn't affect functionality
- Fixing might require changing format precision, potentially breaking existing code

**Arguments against:**
- The docstring makes an explicit guarantee without caveats
- Property-based testing is designed to catch exactly these edge cases
- The fix is straightforward (either code or documentation)

**Verdict:** Could be considered WONTFIX if deemed too trivial, but the explicit guarantee argues against this.

### Evaluating as INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- None - the bug is real and reproducible

**Arguments against:**
- The documentation is explicit about the guarantee
- The test correctly identifies a violation
- The failure is not due to misunderstanding or incorrect usage

**Verdict:** NOT invalid - this is a legitimate issue.

### Evaluating as FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Could reframe as "please handle extremely large values better"

**Arguments against:**
- The docstring already claims to handle these values correctly
- This is about fixing existing behavior, not adding new functionality
- The guarantee is already part of the documented API

**Verdict:** NOT a feature request - the feature allegedly exists but doesn't work as documented.

### Evaluating as DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- The easiest fix is to update the docstring to reflect reality
- The current behavior is reasonable (11 chars for 1000+ PiB is acceptable)
- Changing the docstring has no risk of breaking existing code
- The documentation overpromised what the implementation delivers

**Arguments against:**
- The documentation sets a clear API contract that users might depend on
- Code depending on 10-character maximum output could break

**Verdict:** This COULD be treated as a documentation fix, acknowledging the implementation as correct.

### Final Assessment
This bug report presents a clear case where the implementation violates the documented contract. The most appropriate categorizations are:

1. **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** (most practical) - Update the docstring to say "For values < 1000 * 2**50, the output is always <= 10 characters" or remove the guarantee entirely
2. **BUG** (technically correct) - The code doesn't match the documentation, so it's a bug

Given that:
- The affected range (1000-1024 PiB) is extremely unlikely in practice
- The violation is minor (1 extra character)
- Fixing the code could break formatting consistency
- The documentation change is risk-free

I recommend categorizing this as **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**.
