TRIAGE ANALYSIS: dask.base.key_split UnicodeDecodeError

## Analysis of Potential Classifications

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The docstring explicitly shows bytes inputs are supported with example: `key_split(b'hello-world-1')`
- The function crashes on valid bytes input (b'\x80') with UnicodeDecodeError
- The function has error handling for other edge cases (returns 'Other' for errors) but fails to handle this one
- Inconsistent behavior: handles None gracefully but crashes on non-UTF8 bytes
- No documentation specifies that bytes must be UTF-8 encoded
- The crash prevents the function from working with arbitrary bytes data, which could be task keys from non-UTF8 sources

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None substantial

**Verdict:** STRONG case for BUG

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could argue that bytes should be UTF-8 by default in Python 3
- The example in docstring uses ASCII-compatible bytes

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The docstring doesn't specify UTF-8 requirement
- Python bytes objects can contain any byte values, not just UTF-8
- The function explicitly accepts bytes type, implying it should handle all bytes
- Other parts of the function handle errors gracefully

**Verdict:** WEAK case for INVALID

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Non-UTF8 bytes in task keys might be extremely rare in practice
- The fix is trivial (use errors='replace' or 'ignore')
- Current behavior might be intentional to catch encoding issues early

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug causes a crash rather than degraded functionality
- The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality
- The function already has error handling that should catch this

**Verdict:** WEAK case for WONTFIX

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Supporting non-UTF8 bytes could be seen as a new feature
- Current implementation might have assumed UTF-8 only

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The docstring already shows bytes as supported
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The function signature already accepts bytes

**Verdict:** WEAK case for FEATURE_REQUEST

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could update docs to specify "UTF-8 encoded bytes only"
- The implementation works fine for UTF-8 bytes as shown in example

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This would be documenting a limitation rather than intended behavior
- The function's error handling philosophy suggests all inputs should be handled gracefully
- Other similar functions in Dask handle encoding errors properly
- Restricting to UTF-8 only limits the function unnecessarily

**Verdict:** MODERATE case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX, but not ideal

## Final Analysis

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function:

1. Explicitly documents bytes support without UTF-8 restrictions
2. Has comprehensive error handling that should catch this case
3. Crashes instead of degrading gracefully like it does for other errors
4. Violates the principle of least surprise - if bytes are accepted, all bytes should work

The proposed fix is reasonable and maintains backward compatibility while fixing the crash. Using `errors='replace'` or `errors='ignore'` would allow the function to handle all bytes inputs gracefully, consistent with its documented interface and error-handling philosophy.
