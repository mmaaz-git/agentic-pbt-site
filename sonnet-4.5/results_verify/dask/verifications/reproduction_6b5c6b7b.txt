# Reproduction of Bug Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for `dask.utils.key_split` function. The function crashes with a `UnicodeDecodeError` when passed bytes that are not valid UTF-8.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction
I ran the property-based test provided in the bug report:
```python
@given(st.binary(min_size=1, max_size=50))
def test_key_split_with_bytes(b):
    result = key_split(b)
    assert isinstance(result, str)
```

**Result**: The test failed with the exact same input mentioned in the bug report: `b'\x80'`
**Error**: `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte`

### 2. Direct Reproduction
I also ran the direct reproduction code:
```python
print(key_split(b'hello-world-1'))  # Works fine, outputs 'hello-world'
print(key_split(b'\x80'))           # Crashes with UnicodeDecodeError
```

**Result**: Confirmed that valid UTF-8 bytes work correctly, but invalid UTF-8 bytes cause a crash.

## Effect of the Bug
The bug causes the function to crash completely with a `UnicodeDecodeError` when it encounters bytes that cannot be decoded as UTF-8. This is problematic because:

1. The function's docstring explicitly shows bytes as a valid input type with the example `key_split(b'hello-world-1')`
2. The function has a generic exception handler (`except Exception: return "Other"`) that suggests it should handle unexpected inputs gracefully
3. The crash occurs on line 1979 (`return key_split(s.decode())`) which is outside the try-except block that's meant to catch exceptions

## Verification of Code Structure
I examined the source code and confirmed:
- Line 1978-1979: Bytes handling is outside the try-except block
- Line 1982-2002: The try-except block that returns "Other" for exceptions
- The bytes decoding happens before the exception handler can catch errors

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
