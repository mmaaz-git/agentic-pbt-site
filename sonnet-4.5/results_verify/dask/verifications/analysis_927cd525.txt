## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if the function was never intended to accept plain Python lists, and the docstring examples were meant to be illustrative rather than executable. Some functions document conceptual usage that requires preprocessing, and users are expected to understand this context.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The docstring contains explicit, executable examples that are formatted as Python interactive sessions (with `>>>` prompts) showing exact input and expected output. These aren't conceptual illustrations but concrete test cases. When a function's own documentation shows specific code that fails, this is a clear contract violation, not a misunderstanding by the user.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue this is a trivial issue since users could simply wrap their lists in numpy arrays before calling the function. The function might be primarily designed for pandas/numpy use cases, with list support being a nice-to-have that was never fully implemented. Fixing this might require changes to the dispatch system that could have broader implications.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial edge case - it's a fundamental failure of the function to work with the exact inputs shown in its documentation. Every single example in the docstring fails. This isn't an obscure corner case but the primary documented usage pattern. Users reading the documentation would naturally try these examples first and immediately encounter errors.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function might have been designed to work only with numpy arrays or pandas objects, and someone incorrectly wrote the docstring using Python lists for simplicity. The fix would be to update the docstring examples to use numpy arrays instead: `np.array(['A', 'B', 'C', ...])`. The function works correctly with its intended inputs; only the documentation is wrong.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The comment at line 282-283 explicitly states "Convert from an ndarray to a plain list so that any divisions we extract from seq are plain Python scalars." This suggests the function is designed to work with lists internally and should accept them as input. The implementation calling tolist unconditionally seems like a coding error, not a documentation issue. Additionally, the function name and description ("Find division locations and values in sorted list") explicitly mentions "list" not "array."

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding support for Python lists could be viewed as a new feature if the function was originally designed only for numpy/pandas objects. The proposed fix (registering a list handler for the tolist dispatcher) would be adding new functionality that didn't exist before.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality - it's asking for the function to work as already documented. The docstring has always shown list examples, suggesting this was intended behavior from the start. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a clear case where the function fails to work with inputs that are explicitly documented as valid in its own docstring. Every example in the function's documentation fails with an error. The function calls tolist() on all inputs without checking if they're already lists, and the tolist dispatcher lacks a handler for lists. This is a straightforward implementation bug where the code doesn't match the documented behavior.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
One could argue that if this bug has existed for a long time and no one noticed, perhaps no one actually uses the function with lists, and the examples were never meant to be run literally. The function might be internal or deprecated, making this issue less critical.

## Overall Consideration
This appears to be a clear BUG. The function's own documentation contains multiple examples using Python lists as input, formatted as executable Python code with expected output. However, every single one of these examples fails with a TypeError because the implementation unconditionally calls tolist() on the input, and the tolist dispatcher has no handler registered for Python lists.

The evidence strongly supports this being a bug: (1) The docstring shows executable examples that fail, (2) The function's purpose mentions working with "sorted list" explicitly, (3) The internal comment talks about converting TO a list (suggesting lists are the expected internal format), and (4) The fix is straightforward - either skip calling tolist on lists or register a list handler.

While one might consider this a DOCUMENTATION_FIX if the examples were never meant to work, the pervasive use of lists throughout the documentation and the function's stated purpose make this unlikely. This is a contract violation where the implementation fails to support the documented interface, which is the definition of a bug. The function is fundamentally broken for its documented use cases.
