## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in `sorted_division_locations` function from `dask.dataframe.io.io`.

### Bug Verification

The bug is confirmed. When `sorted_division_locations` is called with:
- A sequence containing only duplicate values (e.g., `[0, 0]`)
- `npartitions` parameter specified (e.g., `npartitions=2`)

The function returns fewer divisions than expected (`npartitions + 1`).

### Test Results

1. **Bug Report Case**: `seq=[0, 0], npartitions=2`
   - Expected divisions length: 3 (npartitions + 1)
   - Actual divisions: `[0, 0]` (length: 2)
   - **Result**: FAILS - Returns 2 divisions instead of 3

2. **Extended Test Case**: `seq=[5, 5, 5, 5], npartitions=3`
   - Expected divisions length: 4 (npartitions + 1)
   - Actual divisions: `[5, 5]` (length: 2)
   - **Result**: FAILS - Returns 2 divisions instead of 4

3. **Mixed Values Case**: `seq=[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], npartitions=4`
   - Expected divisions length: 5 (npartitions + 1)
   - Actual divisions: `[1, 2, 3, 3]` (length: 4)
   - **Result**: FAILS - Returns 4 divisions instead of 5

4. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test fails on the example `seq=[0, 0], npartitions=2`

### Pattern Observed

The function fails to return the requested number of divisions when:
1. The sequence contains fewer unique values than the requested number of partitions
2. Specifically, when `len(unique_values) < npartitions`, the function returns at most `len(unique_values) + 1` divisions

### Effect

This behavior violates the expected API contract where:
- `npartitions=N` should result in exactly `N+1` division points
- Callers expecting a specific partition count receive fewer partitions silently
- This could lead to downstream errors in code that assumes the partition count matches what was requested
