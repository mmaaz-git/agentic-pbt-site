## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is **CONFIRMED**. There is indeed a discrepancy between pandas and dask behavior when calling `str.upper()` on strings containing the German ß character.

### Test Results

1. **Direct Reproduction Test**
   - Input: 'ß'
   - Pandas output: 'SS'
   - Dask output: 'ẞ'
   - The assertions in the bug report are correct

2. **Extended Test Cases**
   Tested with multiple German words containing ß:
   - 'ß' → Pandas: 'SS', Dask: 'ẞ'
   - 'Straße' → Pandas: 'STRASSE', Dask: 'STRAẞE'
   - 'groß' → Pandas: 'GROSS', Dask: 'GROẞ'
   - 'weiß' → Pandas: 'WEISS', Dask: 'WEIẞ'

3. **Root Cause Identified**
   The discrepancy stems from different string backends:
   - Standard pandas (with object dtype): Uses Python's str.upper() which converts 'ß' → 'SS'
   - Dask: Uses PyArrow strings by default, which converts 'ß' → 'ẞ' (capital eszett, U+1E9E)
   - PyArrow's utf8_upper() function: Converts 'ß' → 'ẞ'
   - Pandas with PyArrow backend: Also converts 'ß' → 'ẞ' (same as dask)

### Python and Unicode Context
- Python version tested: 3.13.2
- Unicode version: 15.1.0
- Python's standard str.upper(): Converts 'ß' → 'SS' (traditional German convention)
- PyArrow version: 20.0.0
- PyArrow's utf8_upper(): Converts 'ß' → 'ẞ' (using Unicode capital eszett)

### Impact
This bug affects any code that:
1. Migrates from pandas to dask expecting identical string operations
2. Processes German text where the traditional 'ß' → 'SS' conversion is expected
3. Relies on exact string matching after uppercase conversion

The bug report's property-based test correctly identifies this issue, though it primarily manifests with strings containing the German eszett character rather than being a general Unicode issue.
