## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the bug report for `dask.utils.format_bytes`.

### Bug Reproduction

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The hypothesis test successfully found the counterexample with `n=1_125_894_277_343_089_729`. The test correctly fails when checking that the output length is <= 10 characters.

2. **Manual Reproduction**: I confirmed the exact behavior mentioned in the bug report:
   - Input: `1_125_894_277_343_089_729`
   - Output: `'1000.00 PiB'`
   - Length: 11 characters
   - The input is indeed < 2**60
   - The assertion `len(result) <= 10` fails

3. **Additional Test Cases**: I verified the boundary conditions:
   - `format_bytes(999 * 2**50)` → `'999.00 PiB'` (10 chars) ✓
   - `format_bytes(1000 * 2**50)` → `'1000.00 PiB'` (11 chars) ✗
   - `format_bytes(1024 * 2**50 - 1)` → `'1024.00 PiB'` (11 chars) ✗

### Root Cause

The bug occurs because:
1. The function formats numbers with 2 decimal places (`.2f`)
2. When the value reaches 1000 PiB or higher (but still less than 1024 PiB to trigger EiB), the format becomes "XXXX.XX PiB" which is 11 characters
3. The docstring claims all outputs for values < 2**60 will be <= 10 characters

### Impact

The bug is a documentation/contract violation. The actual function works correctly in terms of formatting bytes into human-readable strings. However, it doesn't meet the specific constraint about output length that is documented in both:
- The function's docstring (line 1788 of dask/utils.py)
- The official Dask documentation

The bug affects values in the range [1000 * 2**50, 2**60), which are extremely large values (1000+ PiB) that are uncommon in practice but still within the documented constraint range.
