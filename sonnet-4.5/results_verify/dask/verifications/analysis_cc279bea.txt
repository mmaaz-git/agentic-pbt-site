## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation never promises or implies that format_bytes and parse_bytes should form a perfect round-trip pair. The format_bytes function is explicitly documented to format bytes "as text" for human readability with 2 decimal places, not for data serialization. The parse_bytes function is documented as a flexible parser for various byte string formats, not as the inverse of format_bytes. The expectation of perfect round-trip behavior is an assumption made by the bug reporter that is not supported by the documentation. These functions serve different purposes: one for display, one for parsing user input.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The functions do appear to be complementary in nature - one formats bytes to strings, the other parses byte strings to numbers. The parse_bytes documentation includes examples like parse_bytes('5.4 kB') returning exactly 5400, which could suggest precision is maintained. Users might reasonably expect that formatting a number and then parsing it back would return the original value, especially since both functions are in the same module and have inverse-sounding names.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The precision loss is minimal (typically less than 1%) and unlikely to cause issues in practice. The functions are working as designed - format_bytes prioritizes human readability with its 2-decimal format, which is appropriate for display purposes. Changing this behavior would make the output less readable (e.g., "1.205078125 kiB" instead of "1.21 kiB") or break existing code that depends on the current format. The error is systematic and predictable, not random or unpredictable.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug report identifies a genuine precision loss that could accumulate in certain use cases. If someone uses these functions for configuration storage or data serialization (even if unintended), they could experience data corruption. The issue affects 78.5% of random inputs, making it a widespread problem. The fix could be implemented with a parameter flag to maintain backward compatibility while allowing precise round-trips when needed.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation should explicitly state that these functions are not designed for round-trip conversion and that precision loss will occur due to the 2-decimal formatting. Adding a note like "Note: format_bytes uses 2 decimal places for readability, which means parse_bytes(format_bytes(n)) may not equal n exactly" would clarify expectations. This would prevent users from mistakenly using these functions for data serialization where exact values are required.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current documentation already shows the 2-decimal format in examples (e.g., '1.21 kiB'), making the precision limitation visible. The functions' purposes are clear from their docstrings - one for formatting, one for parsing. Experienced developers should understand that formatting for display inherently involves precision trade-offs. The documentation doesn't need to explicitly state every mathematical property that the functions don't satisfy.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for new functionality - perfect round-trip conversion between format_bytes and parse_bytes. This could be implemented as an optional feature with a precision parameter (e.g., format_bytes(n, precise=True)) that would use more decimal places to preserve the exact value. This would be adding new capability rather than fixing broken existing functionality, since the current behavior matches the documented examples.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report frames this as a violation of expected behavior rather than a request for new functionality. The reporter isn't asking for a new feature but arguing that the existing functions are broken because they don't maintain a mathematical property (round-trip conversion). If this property is considered fundamental to paired format/parse functions, then it's a bug, not a missing feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Round-trip conversion is a fundamental property that users reasonably expect from paired format/parse functions. The precision loss could lead to subtle data corruption if these functions are used for configuration storage or data persistence. The fact that parse_bytes can return exact values for some inputs (like '5.4 kB' -> 5400) suggests the functions should maintain precision. The high failure rate (78.5%) indicates a systematic issue rather than edge cases.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The functions are working exactly as designed and documented. format_bytes explicitly uses ".2f" formatting for human readability, which is shown in all documentation examples. These are utility functions for display and input parsing, not for data serialization. The documentation never promises round-trip behavior, and the examples clearly show 2-decimal formatting. The precision loss is a natural consequence of formatting for human consumption, not a defect.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be an INVALID bug report based on incorrect assumptions about the functions' intended behavior. The documentation and implementation clearly show that format_bytes is designed for human-readable display with 2 decimal places, while parse_bytes is a flexible parser for various input formats. These are not intended as serialization/deserialization functions with perfect round-trip guarantees.

The bug reporter makes a fundamental category error by expecting mathematical properties (perfect round-trip) from functions designed for human interface (display and input parsing). The 2-decimal formatting is not a bug but a deliberate design choice for readability, clearly shown in all documentation examples. While the reporter's mathematical analysis is correct, their premise that this constitutes a bug is flawed.

However, there is merit to the suggestion that the documentation could be clearer about this limitation. A DOCUMENTATION_FIX to explicitly note that these functions don't guarantee round-trip conversion would prevent future confusion. But since the current behavior matches the documented examples and the functions work as designed for their intended purpose, this is ultimately an INVALID bug report stemming from incorrect expectations about undocumented behavior.
