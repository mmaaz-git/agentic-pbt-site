## Documentation Analysis for sorted_division_locations

### Function Documentation
The function `sorted_division_locations` has minimal documentation:

1. **Docstring**: "Find division locations and values in sorted list"
   - Clearly states it operates on a "sorted list"
   - No explicit mention of what happens with unsorted input
   - No statement that unsorted input is forbidden or will raise an error
   - No statement about undefined behavior for unsorted input

2. **Examples in docstring**: All examples show properly sorted lists:
   - ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'] - alphabetically sorted
   - ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C'] - sorted with duplicates

3. **Parameters documentation**: No parameter descriptions beyond the signature

### API Exposure
- The function is NOT part of the public API:
  - `hasattr(dask.dataframe, 'sorted_division_locations')` returns False
  - `hasattr(dask.dataframe.io, 'sorted_division_locations')` returns False
  - It's in `dask.dataframe.io.io` module which appears to be internal

### Internal Usage
- The function is imported and used internally by:
  - `dask.dataframe.dask_expr.io.io` module
  - Test files in `dask.dataframe.io.tests.test_io`
  - When called internally, it's always passed sorted data (e.g., `data.index` where the index is known to be monotonic)

### Key Observation
The docstring clearly states "Find division locations and values in **sorted list**" (emphasis added). This is a clear precondition that the input must be sorted. The function name itself includes "sorted" which further reinforces this expectation.

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say
- Does not explicitly state that unsorted input will cause incorrect results
- Does not state that unsorted input will raise an error
- Does not mention validation of the sorted precondition
- Does not say "undefined behavior" for unsorted input

### Conclusion on Documentation
The documentation is clear that the function expects sorted input. The function name and docstring both indicate this requirement. However, the documentation does not specify what happens when this precondition is violated - it doesn't promise an error will be raised, nor does it warn about undefined behavior.
