BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
===================================

Considering each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report):
   REASONS FOR:
   - The documentation explicitly guarantees "output is always <= 10 characters" for values < 2**60
   - The implementation violates this guarantee for values >= 1000 PiB
   - This is a clear contract violation where the code doesn't meet its documented specification
   - The guarantee appears to be intentional (not a typo) as it's specific and technical
   - The bug affects a valid range of inputs (1000-1024 PiB) that are within the specified domain
   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The affected range is relatively small and at extreme values
   - Could argue the documentation should be updated instead of the code

2. INVALID:
   REASONS FOR:
   - None - the bug report correctly identifies a real discrepancy
   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The test case is correct and reproduces the issue
   - The documentation clearly states the guarantee
   - The values are within the specified range (< 2**60)

3. WONTFIX:
   REASONS FOR:
   - Values >= 1000 PiB are extremely large and unlikely in practice
   - The function still works correctly, just with 11 characters instead of 10
   - The extra character doesn't break functionality, just a formatting guarantee
   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The documentation makes an explicit guarantee that should be honored
   - Even edge cases should comply with documented contracts
   - The fix is straightforward (add EiB unit or adjust decimal places)

4. FEATURE_REQUEST:
   REASONS FOR:
   - Could frame this as requesting support for EiB (exbibyte) units
   - Could be seen as requesting better handling of large values
   REASONS AGAINST:
   - This is about fixing existing documented behavior, not adding new features
   - The documentation already promises this behavior

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   REASONS FOR:
   - The code works correctly in terms of formatting bytes
   - Could update documentation to say "usually <= 10 characters" or "< 1000 PiB"
   - The implementation is reasonable; the documentation overpromised
   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The 10-character limit appears to be a design goal for display formatting
   - Changing documentation weakens a useful guarantee
   - The code fix is simple and maintains the guarantee

CONCLUSION:
This is a BUG. The code violates its explicitly documented contract. While the affected values are large, the documentation makes a clear, specific guarantee that the implementation fails to meet. The principle of maintaining documented contracts is important for API reliability.
