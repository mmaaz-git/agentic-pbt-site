=== Bug Report Analysis ===

Analyzing the bug report for categorization into: BUG, WONTFIX, INVALID, DOCUMENTATION_FIX, or FEATURE_REQUEST

## Consideration for BUG:
Arguments FOR:
- The function permanently modifies index names when they overlap with column names
- This is an unexpected side effect that violates the principle of least surprise
- The renaming appears to be meant as a temporary workaround for sorting, not a permanent change
- Even though it's an internal function, it's used by assert_eq which affects testing reliability
- The fix is straightforward and preserves the intended sorting behavior while eliminating the side effect

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is an internal function (prefixed with _) not part of the public API
- There's no documentation promising index names will be preserved

## Consideration for WONTFIX:
Arguments FOR:
- Internal function that users shouldn't be calling directly
- The renaming might be intentional to avoid ambiguity in sorted results
- Only affects edge cases where index names match column names

Arguments AGAINST:
- The bug affects assert_eq, a widely-used testing utility
- The side effect can mask real bugs in tests
- The fix is simple and non-breaking

## Consideration for INVALID:
Arguments FOR:
- No documentation specifies the expected behavior
- Internal functions can have any behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- The behavior is clearly unintended based on the code structure
- The renaming is done to enable sorting, not as an end goal
- Functions shouldn't have unexpected persistent side effects

## Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
Arguments FOR:
- Could document that _maybe_sort modifies index names
- Could warn users about this behavior in assert_eq

Arguments AGAINST:
- This appears to be unintended behavior, not something to document
- Internal functions typically don't get documentation

## Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
Arguments FOR:
- Could frame as "add feature to preserve index names during sorting"

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already sorts; it just has an unintended side effect

## Final Assessment:
This is a valid BUG. While _maybe_sort is an internal function, it:
1. Has an unintended side effect (permanent index name mutation)
2. Affects the behavior of assert_eq, a critical testing utility
3. Violates reasonable expectations (temporary renaming should be restored)
4. Has a clear, simple fix that maintains intended functionality
5. Can cause real issues in testing by masking bugs

The fact that it's internal doesn't make it WONTFIX because the side effect impacts testing reliability through assert_eq.
