## Bug Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The technical details are accurate.

### Verification of Claims

1. **The function violates its documented constraint**: CONFIRMED
   - The docstring states: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
   - Testing shows this is violated for values >= 999.995 * 2**50 (approximately 1000 PiB)

2. **Specific failing input**: CONFIRMED
   - Input: 1125899906842624000 (exactly 1000 * 2**50)
   - Output: '1000.00 PiB'
   - Length: 11 characters (violates the <= 10 constraint)
   - This value is indeed < 2**60

3. **Range of violations**: CONFIRMED
   - The violation occurs for all values from 999.995 PiB to 1024 PiB
   - All these values are < 2**60 (since 2**60 = 1024 * 2**50)
   - The output for these values is consistently 11 characters

### Technical Analysis

The root cause is exactly as described in the bug report:
- When n/k >= 999.995 (where k = 2**50 for PiB), the formatted output rounds to 1000.00 or higher
- The format string "{n / k:.2f} {prefix}B" produces:
  - 4 digits before decimal (1000-1024)
  - A decimal point
  - 2 decimal digits
  - A space
  - "PiB" (3 characters)
  - Total: 11 characters

The hypothesis test found 13 violations in 1000 samples, all in the range 1000-1024 PiB.

### Mathematical Verification

- 2**60 = 1152921504606846976
- 1024 * 2**50 = 1152921504606846976 (exactly 2**60)
- 1000 * 2**50 = 1125899906842624000 (< 2**60)
- All values from 1000 PiB to just under 1024 PiB are < 2**60 and produce 11-character outputs

The bug report is technically correct and accurately describes the violation of the documented constraint.
