Bug Triage Analysis
===================

## INVALID Considerations

**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation never explicitly states that the combine() method must be associative in terms of structural representation. The _DNF class is an internal implementation detail not part of the public API, and the documentation only describes the filter format, not the mathematical properties of internal operations. Since the filtering behavior is logically equivalent (both expressions filter data identically), and there's no documented contract about structural identity, this could be considered working as intended within the unspecified behavior territory.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The combine() method performs a logical AND operation, and in boolean algebra, AND is fundamentally associative. Users reasonably expect that (A AND B) AND C should equal A AND (B AND C) not just logically but also structurally when dealing with normalized forms. The fact that the method produces different internal structures violates basic mathematical principles that developers would naturally assume.

## WONTFIX Considerations

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The issue only affects the internal representation, not the actual filtering behavior. The extra branches contain contradictory conditions that can never be satisfied, so they don't affect the practical outcome. This is an edge case that occurs with unusual filter combinations that are unlikely in real-world usage. The performance impact is minimal, and fixing this would require significant refactoring of the normalization logic for little practical benefit.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This violates a fundamental mathematical property that could lead to confusion and unexpected behavior. The inconsistent internal representation could cause issues with debugging, testing, and optimization passes. The presence of contradictory conditions indicates inefficient normalization that wastes computational resources. This is not just a cosmetic issue but reflects a deeper problem in the algorithm.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code behaves reasonably (filters work correctly) but the documentation doesn't clarify that the internal representation may vary based on combination order. Adding a note that "_DNF.combine() produces logically equivalent but potentially structurally different representations" would set correct expectations. The documentation could explain that the normalization process doesn't guarantee a canonical form.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The issue is with the code's behavior, not the documentation's description of it. The lack of associativity is a bug in the implementation, not a feature that needs better documentation. Documenting this as expected behavior would be admitting a design flaw rather than fixing the underlying problem.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Currently, the code doesn't provide canonical DNF normalization, which could be seen as a missing feature rather than a bug. Adding support for truly associative combination with canonical form normalization would be an enhancement. This could be implemented as a new method or an option to ensure consistent representations regardless of combination order.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Associativity is not a new feature but a basic mathematical property that should already be satisfied. The combine() method is already supposed to combine filters correctly; making it work properly isn't adding new functionality but fixing existing behavior. This is a correction of the current implementation, not an addition of new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations

**Why it might be BUG:**
The combine() method violates the mathematical property of associativity, producing different results based on grouping order. This is a clear algorithmic error in the normalization process that generates unnecessary contradictory conditions. The issue is reproducible, well-defined, and represents incorrect behavior in a mathematical operation. The fix is straightforward and would improve both correctness and efficiency.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The actual filtering behavior is correct - data is filtered identically regardless of combination order. This is an internal implementation detail of a private class (_DNF) not documented as part of the public API. The structural difference doesn't cause any functional problems or incorrect results. Without explicit documentation guaranteeing structural associativity, this behavior isn't technically incorrect.

## Overall Consideration

Upon careful analysis, this issue presents a complex triage decision. The _DNF class performs logical operations that should follow mathematical laws, and the combine() method produces structurally different results based on operation grouping, violating the associative property. However, the practical impact is limited since the filtering behavior remains logically equivalent.

The key factors to consider are: (1) This is an internal class not part of the documented public API, (2) The logical behavior is correct even if the structure differs, (3) The issue only manifests with specific complex filter combinations, and (4) The contradictory conditions generated indicate inefficient but not incorrect behavior.

Given that this is an internal implementation detail that doesn't affect the actual filtering results, and the documentation makes no promises about structural properties of the combine operation, this issue falls into a gray area. While mathematically unsatisfying, it doesn't cause functional problems for users of the public API. The most appropriate classification would be WONTFIX, as the issue, while technically valid, has minimal practical impact and fixing it would require non-trivial refactoring of internal logic for little user benefit. Alternatively, DOCUMENTATION_FIX could be appropriate if the maintainers want to explicitly note this limitation.
