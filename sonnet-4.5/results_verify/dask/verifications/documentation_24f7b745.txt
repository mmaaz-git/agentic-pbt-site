Documentation Analysis for dask.array.squeeze
==============================================

After reviewing the documentation for both NumPy and Dask's squeeze functions:

NumPy squeeze documentation:
- The function removes axes of length one from an array
- Raises ValueError when trying to squeeze an axis with size not equal to one
- The NumPy documentation doesn't explicitly mention AxisError
- However, based on actual testing, NumPy raises AxisError for out-of-bounds axis values

Dask squeeze documentation:
- States it is "Copied from NumPy" with potential minor inconsistencies
- Documents that it raises ValueError when attempting to squeeze an axis with size not equal to one
- Does not explicitly document what happens for out-of-bounds axis values
- Claims to provide NumPy-compatible API

Key findings:
1. Neither documentation explicitly states what error type should be raised for out-of-bounds axis values
2. Dask documentation explicitly claims NumPy compatibility but acknowledges potential "minor inconsistencies"
3. The actual NumPy implementation raises AxisError (from numpy.exceptions module) for out-of-bounds axis
4. The Dask documentation does not specify that IndexError should be raised for any condition

Since Dask explicitly aims for NumPy compatibility and the documentation doesn't specify a different behavior for out-of-bounds axis values, the expectation would be that Dask should match NumPy's behavior of raising AxisError (or at least a more descriptive error than IndexError).
