## Documentation Analysis for ResourceProfiler

### Official Documentation Review

1. **Class Documentation**:
   - The ResourceProfiler class docstring states it is "A profiler for resource use"
   - Records three metrics at each timestep:
     1. Time in seconds since the epoch
     2. Memory usage in MB
     3. % CPU usage
   - Provides usage examples showing context manager and global registration patterns
   - No mention of constraints or valid ranges for the dt parameter

2. **Constructor Documentation**:
   - The `__init__` method has minimal documentation: "Initialize self. See help(type(self)) for accurate signature."
   - Default value for dt is 1 (second)
   - No specification of valid ranges or constraints for dt

3. **Online Documentation (docs.dask.org)**:
   - Shows examples using positive values: `ResourceProfiler(dt=0.5)`, `ResourceProfiler(dt=0.25)`
   - Describes dt as the "timestep" for recording resource usage
   - No explicit constraints mentioned for dt values
   - No warnings about negative values

4. **Parameter Semantics**:
   - The parameter name `dt` conventionally means "delta time" or time interval
   - In scientific/engineering contexts, dt represents a positive time step
   - Negative time intervals don't make semantic sense for periodic sampling

### Documentation Gaps

1. **Missing Constraints**: The documentation does not specify that dt must be positive or non-negative
2. **Missing Validation**: No documentation about what happens with invalid values
3. **Implicit Assumptions**: The documentation assumes users understand that time intervals should be positive
4. **No Error Handling Documentation**: No mention of what errors might be raised for invalid inputs

### Conclusion on Documentation

The documentation does not explicitly state that dt must be positive or non-negative. However, given that:
- dt represents a time interval for periodic sampling
- All examples use positive values
- The semantic meaning of a "timestep" implies forward progression in time
- The underlying implementation uses `sleep(dt)` which requires non-negative values

It is reasonable to expect that dt should be positive (or at minimum, non-negative). The lack of explicit documentation about this constraint is a documentation gap, but the intended behavior is clear from context and common programming conventions.
