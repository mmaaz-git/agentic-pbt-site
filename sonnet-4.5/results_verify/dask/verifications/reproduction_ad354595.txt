BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

## Test Execution Summary

Successfully reproduced the reported bug using both the simple demonstration and the hypothesis-based property test.

## Key Findings

### 1. Type Mismatch Confirmed
- Line 261: `pid = current_process()` assigns a Process object to the variable `pid`
- Line 252: `p.pid != pid` compares an integer (p.pid) with a Process object (pid)
- This comparison ALWAYS evaluates to True in Python since an integer can never equal a Process object

### 2. Reproduction Results

**Basic Type Comparison Test:**
- `12345 != <Process object>` evaluates to True (always)
- `12345 != 228710` evaluates to True (when PIDs differ)
- Confirmed that current_process() returns a Process object, not an integer

**_Tracker Method Test:**
When passing a Process object to _update_pids:
- Mock child with PID 54321: INCLUDED in results (should be included)
- Mock child with same PID as current process (228710): INCLUDED in results (BUG - should be excluded)

When passing an integer PID to _update_pids:
- Mock child with PID 54321: INCLUDED in results (correct)
- Mock child with same PID as current process (228710): EXCLUDED from results (correct behavior)

### 3. Impact Analysis

The bug causes the tracker process to never filter itself out from monitoring, meaning:
- The ResourceProfiler includes its own CPU and memory usage in measurements
- This inflates the reported resource usage
- The inflation is likely small but consistent across all measurements

### 4. Bug Validity

The bug report is technically correct:
1. There IS a type mismatch bug on line 261
2. The comparison on line 252 does fail to work as intended
3. The tracker process is never filtered out as it should be
4. The suggested fix (changing to `pid = current_process().pid`) would resolve the issue

## Verification

The hypothesis test confirms that with ANY integer PID value, the mock child is always included in the results when a Process object is passed to _update_pids, demonstrating the filter never works correctly.
