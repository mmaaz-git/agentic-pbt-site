## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for dask.bag.Bag.var. Here are my findings:

### Reproduction Results

1. **Simple Test Case Confirmation**:
   - For input [1.0, 2.0] with ddof=3, the method returns -0.5 (negative variance)
   - This confirms the bug report's specific failing case

2. **Extended Testing Results**:

   For [1.0, 2.0] (n=2):
   - ddof=0: variance = 0.25 (correct, positive)
   - ddof=1: variance = 0.5 (correct, positive)
   - ddof=2: ZeroDivisionError (division by zero when n-ddof=0)
   - ddof=3: variance = -0.5 (BUG: negative variance)
   - ddof=4: variance = -0.25 (BUG: negative variance)

   For [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] (n=5):
   - ddof=0 through 4: positive variances
   - ddof=5: ZeroDivisionError
   - ddof=6: variance = -10.0 (BUG: negative variance)

3. **Property-Based Testing**:
   The hypothesis test fails with various inputs, confirming that the issue is systematic when ddof > n.

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug occurs in `/dask/bag/chunk.py:var_aggregate` function at line 36:
```python
return result * n / (n - ddof)
```

When ddof > n:
- The denominator (n - ddof) becomes negative
- Since result is always positive (sum of squared deviations), multiplying by n and dividing by a negative number produces a negative variance

### Comparison with Other Libraries

I tested the same scenarios with NumPy and pandas:

- **NumPy**: Returns `inf` (infinity) when ddof >= n with a RuntimeWarning
- **Pandas**: Returns `nan` when ddof >= n
- **Dask**: Returns negative values when ddof > n (BUG) and raises ZeroDivisionError when ddof = n

This shows that Dask's behavior is inconsistent with established statistical libraries.

### Impact

This is a **data corruption bug** that silently returns mathematically impossible negative variance values. Users relying on variance calculations for statistical analysis could get incorrect results without any warning or error, potentially leading to wrong conclusions in data analysis pipelines.
