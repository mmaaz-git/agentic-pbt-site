## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Confirmed
The bug report is technically correct. The code does crash with ZeroDivisionError in the following cases:

1. **[1.0, 2.0] with ddof=2**: Crashes with ZeroDivisionError (n - ddof = 2 - 2 = 0)
2. **Empty sequence [] with ddof=0**: Crashes with ZeroDivisionError (division by n=0 in line 35)
3. **[1.0, 2.0, 3.0] with ddof=3**: Crashes with ZeroDivisionError (n - ddof = 3 - 3 = 0)

### Interesting Behavior
When ddof > n (e.g., [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] with ddof=4), Dask returns -2.0, which is mathematically nonsensical (variance cannot be negative). This happens because n - ddof = -1, creating a negative denominator.

### Root Cause
The var_aggregate function in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/bag/chunk.py:
- Line 35: `result = (x2 / n) - (x / n) ** 2` crashes when n=0 (empty bag)
- Line 36: `return result * n / (n - ddof)` crashes when n - ddof = 0

### Comparison with Other Libraries
- **NumPy**: Returns `inf` for division by zero cases with RuntimeWarning, `nan` for empty arrays
- **Pandas**: Returns `nan` for all invalid cases (more consistent behavior)
- Both handle these edge cases gracefully without crashing

### Statistical Context
The variance formula requires dividing by (n - ddof). When this denominator is:
- Zero: The variance is undefined (division by zero)
- Negative: The result is meaningless (negative variance)
- These cases represent invalid statistical operations where we have more constraints (ddof) than data points (n)

### Summary
The bug is real - Dask crashes with ZeroDivisionError while NumPy and Pandas handle these cases gracefully by returning special values (inf/nan). The proposed fix to raise a more informative ValueError is reasonable, though returning nan (like Pandas) would also be acceptable.
