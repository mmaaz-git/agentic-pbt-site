BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

Consideration for each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
---------------------------------------
STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
- The LRU cache incorrectly reduces its size when updating existing keys
- This violates standard LRU cache semantics universally understood in computer science
- The cache fails to maintain its size invariant (up to maxsize items)
- The proposed fix is correct and straightforward
- The bug has real performance impact (reduced cache effectiveness)
- Reproduction is consistent and deterministic
- The class name "LRU" implies standard LRU behavior which is violated

EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- None. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
---------------------------------
EVIDENCE FOR:
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- The bug reproduces exactly as described
- The analysis is correct
- The root cause is accurately identified

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
----------------------------------
EVIDENCE FOR:
- Could argue it's an edge case in internal utility code

EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- LRU cache is used for performance-critical caching of division information
- Incorrect cache size reduces cache hit rate, impacting performance
- The fix is simple and safe
- This is a fundamental correctness issue in a data structure

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
-------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE FOR:
- Could argue that "correct LRU update behavior" is a feature not yet implemented

EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature
- LRU caches have well-established semantics
- The class claims to be an LRU cache but doesn't behave like one

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
--------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE FOR:
- The docstring doesn't explicitly specify update behavior

EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- LRU has standard meaning in computer science
- No documentation suggests the current behavior is intentional
- Fixing documentation to match broken behavior would be wrong

FINAL ASSESSMENT
---------------
This is unequivocally a BUG. The LRU cache implementation violates fundamental LRU semantics by incorrectly evicting items when updating existing keys. This is not a documentation issue, feature request, or trivial concern - it's a correctness bug in a basic data structure that impacts cache performance. The fix is simple, correct, and necessary.
