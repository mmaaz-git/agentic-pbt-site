# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The Dask DataFrame resample function returns incorrect results when using quarterly resampling with `closed='right'` and `label='right'` parameters.

## Test Results

### 1. Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis property-based test confirmed the bug. When running with the specific failing input parameters:
- npartitions=4
- rule='Q'
- closed='right'
- label='right'
- method='sum'

The test fails with an AssertionError showing that the last value differs between Pandas and Dask.

### 2. Simple Reproduction
Running the simple reproduction code confirms the exact bug described:

**Pandas result (correct):**
```
              value
2020-03-31   4095.0
2020-06-30  12376.0
2020-09-30  20930.0
2020-12-31  29394.0
```

**Dask result (incorrect):**
```
              value
2020-03-31   4095.0
2020-06-30  12376.0
2020-09-30  20930.0
2020-12-31      0.0   # WRONG - should be 29394.0
```

## Impact
The bug causes silent data corruption where the last quarter's aggregated value is completely wrong (returns 0.0 instead of 29394.0). This is a significant issue because:
1. No warning or error is raised
2. The incorrect result appears valid at first glance
3. It only affects specific parameter combinations, making it hard to detect
4. The magnitude of error is severe (100% data loss for the last period)

## Code Analysis
I verified the source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/tseries/resample.py` and confirmed the problematic code exists at lines 93-101 as described in the bug report. The issue is that a single `setter` function is chosen based on `len(newdivs)` but then applied to both `newdivs` and `outdivs`, which can have different lengths, leading to the mismatch described in the report.
