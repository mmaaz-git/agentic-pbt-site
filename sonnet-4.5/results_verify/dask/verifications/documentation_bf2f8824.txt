## Documentation Analysis for fix_bounds

### Available Documentation

#### Source Code Documentation
The only documentation for `fix_bounds` is its docstring:
```python
def fix_bounds(start, end, min_span):
    """Adjust end point to ensure span of at least `min_span`"""
    return start, max(end, start + min_span)
```

#### Key Findings

1. **Function Purpose**: The docstring states the function will "Adjust end point to ensure span of at least `min_span`"

2. **No External Documentation**:
   - The function is not documented in Dask's public API documentation
   - No mention in the main diagnostics documentation page
   - Function appears to be an internal utility function

3. **Usage Context**:
   - Used internally within profile_visualize.py for setting plot bounds
   - Called with values for CPU percentage (0-100) and memory ranges
   - Called with time ranges for x-axis

4. **No Precision Warnings**:
   - The docstring makes no mention of floating-point precision limitations
   - No caveats about large numbers or precision loss
   - The word "ensure" implies a guarantee that may not hold

### Documentation Assessment

The documentation creates an implicit contract through the word "ensure" - this suggests the function guarantees that the returned span will be at least `min_span`. There are no documented exceptions or limitations regarding:
- Floating-point precision
- Behavior with very large numbers
- ULP-level differences
- Any approximation in the guarantee

Given that this is an internal utility function primarily used for plot visualization (where sub-ULP precision is irrelevant), the documentation could be considered incomplete rather than incorrect. However, the strong language ("ensure") does create an expectation that isn't met in edge cases.
