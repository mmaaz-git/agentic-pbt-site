## Documentation Analysis for sorted_division_locations

I've examined the function `sorted_division_locations` in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/io/io.py` and its related dispatch system.

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **Docstring Examples**: The function's docstring (lines 259-278) explicitly contains multiple examples that use Python lists as input:
   ```python
   >>> L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
   >>> sorted_division_locations(L, chunksize=2)
   (['A', 'C', 'E', 'F'], [0, 2, 4, 6])

   >>> sorted_division_locations(L, chunksize=3)
   (['A', 'D', 'F'], [0, 3, 6])
   ```

   These examples clearly show that the function is intended to accept Python lists as input.

2. **Function Comment**: Line 282-283 states:
   ```python
   # Convert from an ndarray to a plain list so that
   # any divisions we extract from seq are plain Python scalars.
   ```
   This comment suggests the function wants to work with lists internally and expects to convert arrays TO lists, not FROM lists.

3. **Implementation**: Line 284 calls `seq = tolist(seq)` to convert the input to a list. The `tolist` function is a dispatched function that needs appropriate handlers for different input types.

4. **Dispatch System**: The `tolist` dispatch system (defined in `dask/dataframe/dispatch.py`) currently has handlers registered for:
   - `np.ndarray`
   - `pd.Series`
   - `pd.Index`
   - `pd.Categorical`
   - cudf objects (lazy registration)
   - cupy arrays (lazy registration)

   However, there is NO handler registered for Python's built-in `list` type.

5. **Purpose of Function**: The function finds division locations and values in a sorted sequence, returning divisions (values at partition boundaries) and locations (indices of those boundaries).

### Documentation Verdict:

The documentation (specifically the docstring examples) EXPLICITLY shows that the function should accept Python lists as input. Multiple examples demonstrate this expected behavior. The fact that these documented examples crash when run indicates a clear disconnect between the documented behavior and the actual implementation.

The documentation is not ambiguous - it clearly shows Python lists being passed to the function and the expected output. This is not a case of unspecified behavior or missing documentation.
