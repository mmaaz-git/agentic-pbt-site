## Bug Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Documentation explicitly shows list usage** - Every single example in the docstring uses plain Python lists
2. **Function crashes on documented examples** - The exact examples from the docstring cause TypeError
3. **Fix is trivial and sensible** - Simply checking if input is already a list before calling tolist()
4. **Function is used internally** - Other parts of dask rely on this function
5. **No type restrictions documented** - Nothing in the docstring says lists aren't supported
6. **Logical expectation** - A function that processes sequences should handle the most basic Python sequence type

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could argue the docstring should be updated to use numpy/pandas types instead
2. Function might have been intended only for internal use with specific types

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function behavior is wrong, not the documentation
2. Supporting lists is more intuitive and expected
3. The fix is trivial and doesn't break anything
4. Lists are the most basic sequence type in Python

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The function clearly doesn't work as documented.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The docstring explicitly shows list examples that don't work
2. The TypeError is not intentional or documented
3. This is not undefined behavior - the examples define expected behavior

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Function might be internal/private (but it's not prefixed with _)
2. Could argue users should use numpy/pandas types

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The docstring examples explicitly use lists
2. Fix is trivial (2-3 lines of code)
3. Breaking on basic Python types is unexpected
4. Function is actively used in dask codebase

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could argue list support is a new feature, not a bug

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The docstring already documents list support with examples
2. It's not a new feature when the documentation already shows it working
3. This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality

### Conclusion
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The function's docstring contains multiple examples using plain Python lists, but the implementation crashes on exactly those inputs. The disparity between documented behavior and actual behavior, combined with the trivial nature of the fix, makes this a clear bug that should be fixed.
