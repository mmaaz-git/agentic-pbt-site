## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation Status

1. **Public API Documentation:**
   - The public `Series.resample()` method is documented in the Dask documentation
   - Documentation describes general functionality for time series resampling
   - Notes some limitations compared to pandas (e.g., no axis, convention, kind parameters)
   - Does NOT specify internal implementation details or division handling

2. **Internal Function Documentation:**
   - `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` is an internal function (prefixed with underscore)
   - NO docstring exists for this function
   - NO comments explain the expected behavior or contract
   - Function signature: `_resample_bin_and_out_divs(divisions, rule, closed='left', label='left')`

3. **Usage Context:**
   - The function is called from `ResampleReduction._resample_divisions` property
   - Returns a tuple of two elements: (newdivs, outdivs)
   - These are used as:
     - newdivs: new divisions for repartitioning
     - outdivs: output divisions for creating BlockwiseDep objects
   - Both are used to construct BlockwiseDep objects with expressions like:
     - `BlockwiseDep(output_divisions[:-1])`
     - `BlockwiseDep(output_divisions[1:])`

4. **Implicit Contract:**
   - While not documented, the code usage clearly shows both returned tuples must have the same length
   - Line 162-163 in resample.py creates BlockwiseDep objects from slices of outdivs
   - Line 164 creates a list with length based on outdivs
   - The Repartition operation expects consistent division boundaries

### Documentation Findings

**No explicit documentation exists** stating that `newdivs` and `outdivs` must have the same length. However, this is an **implicit requirement** based on:

1. The function is internal (underscore-prefixed), suggesting it's not part of the public API
2. The way the returned values are used in the code requires them to be the same length
3. The downstream code creates parallel structures from both division sets

### Conclusion

The lack of documentation for this internal function does not invalidate the bug. The function has a clear implicit contract based on its usage pattern - it must return two division tuples of the same length for the resampling operation to work correctly. The bug violates this implicit contract, causing legitimate runtime failures in normal usage scenarios.
