DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR DASK.ARRAY.OVERLAP.PERIODIC AND REFLECT FUNCTIONS

## Function Documentation

1. **periodic() function docstring**:
   - "Copy a slice of an array around to its other side"
   - "Useful to create periodic boundary conditions for overlap"
   - Very minimal documentation, no mention of depth constraints

2. **reflect() function docstring**:
   - "Reflect boundaries of array on the same side"
   - "This is the converse of periodic"
   - Similarly minimal, no depth constraints mentioned

3. **overlap() function documentation**:
   - More comprehensive documentation in the overlap() function
   - States: "If depth is larger than any chunk along a particular axis, then the array is rechunked"
   - This implies that large depth values should be handled by rechunking, not by raising errors
   - The documentation shows examples with various depth values but no explicit mention of depth > array_size limitation

4. **map_overlap() function documentation**:
   - States: "If depth is larger than any chunk along a particular axis, then the array is rechunked"
   - Again suggests automatic handling through rechunking

## Key Documentation Findings

1. **NO DOCUMENTED LIMITATION**: The documentation does NOT specify that depth must be less than the array size. In fact, it suggests that large depth values are handled through automatic rechunking.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The documentation describes periodic as "wrap borders around to the other side" and reflect as "reflect each border outwards", which are standard operations that should theoretically work with any depth value.

3. **NumPy Comparison**: The documentation does not explicitly compare with NumPy's pad function, but given that dask arrays are meant to provide a NumPy-like interface, consistency with NumPy behavior would be expected.

4. **ensure_minimum_chunksize()**: There's a function in the overlap module specifically designed to handle cases where depth exceeds chunk sizes, but it appears to not be used in the periodic/reflect functions directly.

5. **Error Handling**: The only documented error for excessive depth is in ensure_minimum_chunksize() which states: "The overlapping depth {size} is larger than your array {sum(chunks)}." This error message is different from what we're seeing, suggesting the bug is in a different code path.

## Documentation Gaps

- The periodic() and reflect() functions have minimal documentation
- No explicit mention of what happens when depth > array_size
- No warnings about potential limitations
- The behavior is not clearly specified for edge cases
