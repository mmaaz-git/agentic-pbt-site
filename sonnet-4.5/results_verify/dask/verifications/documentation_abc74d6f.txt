## Documentation Analysis for _sort_mixed

### Function Documentation
The function `_sort_mixed` is a private/internal function in dask.dataframe.dask_expr._expr module. The only documentation available is its docstring:

```python
def _sort_mixed(values):
    """order ints before strings before nulls in 1d arrays"""
```

### Key Observations:

1. **Private Function**: The function name starts with underscore, indicating it's intended for internal use only, not part of the public API.

2. **Docstring Specification**: The docstring states the function should "order ints before strings before nulls in 1d arrays". However, this description is incomplete as the actual implementation also handles tuples.

3. **Implementation Details**: Looking at the code, the function explicitly handles four types:
   - Numbers (integers/floats) - sorted first
   - Strings - sorted second
   - Tuples - sorted third
   - Nulls (NaN values) - sorted last

4. **No Public Documentation**: There is no public documentation for this function in the Dask documentation. This is expected since it's a private internal function.

5. **Ambiguity**: The docstring doesn't mention tuples at all, yet the implementation clearly has code to handle them (`tuple_pos` variable and related logic). This suggests either:
   - The docstring is incomplete/outdated
   - Tuple handling was added later without updating the docstring

6. **Expected Behavior**: Based on the implementation, the function appears designed to sort mixed-type arrays by segregating them into type groups (numbers, strings, tuples, nulls) and sorting within each group, then concatenating in that order.

### Conclusion on Documentation:
The documentation (docstring) is incomplete as it doesn't mention tuple handling, which is clearly implemented in the code. This creates ambiguity about whether tuples are officially supported or not.
