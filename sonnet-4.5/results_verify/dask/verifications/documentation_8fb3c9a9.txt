## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation for `not_zero` Parameter

From the dask.bytes.core.read_bytes docstring (lines 45-46):
```
not_zero : bool
    Force seek of start-of-file delimiter, discarding header.
```

### Interpretation

The documentation states that `not_zero=True` should:
1. Force a seek past the start-of-file delimiter
2. Discard the header

The documentation is somewhat ambiguous but implies that:
- The first byte should be skipped (as a "header")
- The remaining content should be returned in blocks

### Expected Behavior

Based on the documentation, when `not_zero=True`:
1. The function should skip the first byte of the file
2. All subsequent data should be returned in appropriately sized blocks
3. No empty blocks should be created

### Actual Behavior

The current implementation:
1. Adjusts the first block's offset to 1 (skipping first byte) âœ“
2. Reduces the first block's length by 1
3. This can result in empty blocks when the first block is only 1 byte long

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not explicitly specify:
1. What happens when the first block is exactly 1 byte
2. Whether empty blocks are acceptable output
3. The exact semantics of "discarding header" in edge cases

### Related Functions

The fsspec `read_block` function documentation confirms:
- When given offset and length, it reads exactly those bytes
- Reading 0 bytes (length=0) will return an empty result
- This is working as designed for fsspec

### Conclusion

While the documentation is not perfectly clear about edge cases, the reasonable interpretation is that:
1. `not_zero=True` should skip the first byte
2. All returned blocks should contain data (non-empty)
3. If a block would be empty after adjustment, it should be removed entirely

The current behavior of returning empty blocks appears to be an unintended consequence of the implementation rather than a documented feature. The documentation does not suggest that empty blocks are an expected output.
