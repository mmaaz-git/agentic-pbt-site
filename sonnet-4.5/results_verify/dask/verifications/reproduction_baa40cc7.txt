REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST CONFIRMATION:
   - The property-based test using Hypothesis correctly identifies the bug
   - The test fails with input n = 1,125,894,277,343,089,729
   - This produces output '1000.00 PiB' which has length 11, violating the <= 10 character constraint

2. SPECIFIC EXAMPLE VERIFICATION:
   - The specific example in the bug report is accurate
   - format_bytes(1125894277343089729) returns '1000.00 PiB' (11 characters)
   - This clearly violates the documented constraint

3. BOUNDARY ANALYSIS:
   I tested multiple boundary cases and found:
   - format_bytes(999.00 PiB) = '999.00 PiB' (10 chars) - OK
   - format_bytes(999.90 PiB) = '999.90 PiB' (10 chars) - OK
   - format_bytes(999.99 PiB) = '999.99 PiB' (10 chars) - OK
   - format_bytes(1000.00 PiB) = '1000.00 PiB' (11 chars) - VIOLATES
   - format_bytes(1001.00 PiB) = '1001.00 PiB' (11 chars) - VIOLATES
   - format_bytes(1023.00 PiB) = '1023.00 PiB' (11 chars) - VIOLATES
   - format_bytes(2^60 - 1) = '1024.00 PiB' (11 chars) - VIOLATES

4. ROOT CAUSE:
   The issue occurs when n/k >= 1000 for the PiB unit. The formatting string "{n / k:.2f} {prefix}B"
   produces outputs like "1000.00" (7 chars) + " " (1 char) + "PiB" (3 chars) = 11 characters total.

   The function doesn't handle the case where the numeric part becomes 4 digits (1000 or greater),
   which pushes the total length beyond 10 characters.

5. IMPACT:
   Any value >= 1000 PiB (approximately 1,125,899,906,842,624,000 bytes) will violate the documented
   10-character limit. This includes the maximum documented value of 2^60 - 1, which formats as
   '1024.00 PiB' (11 characters).

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
