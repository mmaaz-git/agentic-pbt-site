## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function produces empty blocks when `not_zero=True` and the first block is 1 byte
2. Empty blocks violate the reasonable expectation that blocks contain data
3. The behavior is inconsistent - larger files work correctly but edge cases fail
4. Downstream code may fail when encountering unexpected empty blocks
5. The proposed fix is reasonable and maintains backward compatibility for normal cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise non-empty blocks
2. The code is technically doing what it says (skipping first byte, adjusting length)

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The documentation doesn't explicitly state blocks must be non-empty
2. fsspec's read_block correctly returns empty when asked to read 0 bytes
3. The caller could check for and filter empty blocks

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Empty blocks are unexpected and likely to cause issues
2. The behavior is clearly an edge case oversight, not intentional design
3. No reasonable use case exists for returning empty blocks

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR:**
1. This is an extreme edge case (1-byte blocks with not_zero=True)
2. Users can work around it by using larger block sizes
3. The fix might introduce other edge cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The bug can cause data processing failures
2. The fix is straightforward and low-risk
3. Property-based testing revealed this issue, suggesting it could occur in practice

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could be seen as requesting enhanced edge case handling
2. The current behavior is technically what the code does

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature
2. The function already attempts to handle not_zero, just incorrectly for edge cases
3. Users expect consistent behavior regardless of block size

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The documentation could clarify edge case behavior
2. Could document that empty blocks may occur with small block sizes

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The empty blocks are clearly unintended behavior
2. Documenting a bug doesn't make it correct
3. The fix should be in the code, not the documentation

### Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Violates Reasonable Expectations**: Functions that read data in blocks should return blocks containing data. Empty blocks serve no purpose and are likely to cause downstream failures.

2. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The function works correctly for most cases but fails on a specific edge case. This inconsistency indicates a bug rather than intentional design.

3. **Clear Implementation Oversight**: The code blindly subtracts 1 from length[0] without checking if this would result in 0. This is a classic edge case bug.

4. **Practical Impact**: While the edge case is rare, it can cause real failures in data processing pipelines. The property-based test demonstrates this is not just theoretical.

5. **Simple Fix Available**: The proposed fix is straightforward, maintains backward compatibility, and properly handles the edge case.

6. **Not a Documentation Issue**: The documentation's intent is clear - skip the header byte and return the rest. Returning empty blocks contradicts this intent.

The bug should remain open and be fixed as proposed in the report.
