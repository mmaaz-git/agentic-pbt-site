TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code crashes with a TypeError on valid input data structure
- The function already has partial None handling, showing intent to handle this case
- Parquet files with incomplete statistics are a real-world scenario
- The crash prevents reading potentially valid parquet files
- The fix is straightforward and aligns with existing code patterns
- The comparison operation should never crash on None values in a data processing library

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The crash is real and reproducible
- The input is valid according to the function signature
- Nothing in the documentation suggests None values are forbidden
- The function already tries to handle None values, just incompletely

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that parquet files should always have complete statistics

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - incomplete statistics can occur in production
- The crash completely blocks reading of such files
- Other parts of Dask handle missing statistics gracefully
- The fix is trivial and doesn't impact performance

### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is an internal function, not user-facing
- The code clearly intends to handle None values (see line 430)
- The issue is implementation, not documentation

### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function already attempts to handle None values
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The crash is clearly unintended behavior

## Analysis Summary

This is a clear BUG. The function `sorted_columns`:
1. Already has code to handle None min values (line 430-432)
2. Fails to handle None max values before comparison
3. Crashes on valid input that can occur in real-world scenarios
4. Has a simple fix that aligns with the existing code pattern

The bug prevents Dask from reading parquet files with incomplete column statistics, which can happen with:
- Null-only columns
- Corrupted metadata
- Parquet files from certain writers that don't populate all statistics
- Edge cases in distributed systems

This is production-impacting functionality that should work robustly.
