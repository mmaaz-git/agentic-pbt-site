## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

I reviewed the available Dask documentation for the Callback class:

1. **Source Code Documentation (docstring in callbacks.py)**:
   - States that callbacks can be registered globally with `register()` method
   - States that callbacks can be unregistered with `unregister()` method
   - Shows example: `cb.register()` followed by `cb.unregister()`
   - Does not specify behavior when multiple identical callbacks are registered

2. **API Documentation**:
   - The Callback class is documented as a base class for callback mechanisms
   - Supports both context manager usage and global registration/unregistration
   - No explicit mention of how multiple identical callback instances should behave

3. **Diagnostics Documentation**:
   - Shows examples of ProgressBar and other callbacks using register/unregister
   - Does not discuss edge cases with multiple identical callbacks

### Key Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not explicitly address:
1. What happens when multiple `Callback` instances with identical parameters are created
2. Whether each callback instance should be independently registerable/unregisterable
3. The fact that callbacks are identified by their tuple of methods, not by object identity
4. Any warnings about creating multiple callbacks with identical configurations

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected behavior (based on reasonable API expectations):**
- Each `Callback` instance should be independently manageable
- Calling `unregister()` on one instance should not affect other instances
- The API should handle multiple identical callbacks gracefully

**Actual behavior:**
- Multiple identical callbacks share the same identity in the `active` set
- Unregistering one affects all others with the same configuration
- The second `unregister()` raises an unexpected `KeyError`

### Consistency Analysis

The codebase itself is inconsistent:
- `Callback.unregister()` uses `remove()` which raises KeyError if not found
- `add_callbacks.__exit__()` uses `discard()` which silently handles missing items
- This inconsistency suggests the safer `discard()` approach is already recognized as better

### Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise that multiple identical callbacks can be independently managed, this is a reasonable expectation for users of the API. The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise and creates an unnecessary error condition that the related `add_callbacks` class already handles correctly.
