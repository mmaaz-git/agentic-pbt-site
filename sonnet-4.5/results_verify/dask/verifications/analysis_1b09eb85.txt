## Bug Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The function documentation states it returns "the same as the input, but possibly a subset". An empty filter list logically means "no filtering", so it should return the input unchanged.

2. **Reasonable Use Case**: Users may build filters conditionally:
   ```python
   filters = []
   if condition1:
       filters.append(("col1", ">", 5))
   if condition2:
       filters.append(("col2", "==", "value"))
   # filters could be empty if no conditions met
   result = apply_filters(parts, stats, filters)
   ```

3. **Inconsistent with Filtering Logic**: The function already handles cases where filters don't match anything (returns all input). An empty filter list is conceptually the same as "no filtering conditions."

4. **Simple Fix Available**: The proposed fix is minimal and correct - just check for empty list before accessing `filters[0]`.

### INVALID (Why it's NOT invalid)
- The behavior IS specified implicitly: "possibly a subset" means the function can return everything
- Empty lists are valid Python constructs that should be handled gracefully
- The crash is not due to user misunderstanding but a missing edge case check

### WONTFIX (Why it's NOT wontfix)
- This is not an obscure edge case - conditional filter building is common
- The fix is trivial (2-3 lines of code)
- The error message gives no helpful context about what went wrong
- This affects real-world usage patterns

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Why it's NOT just a doc fix)
- While the docs could be clearer about empty lists, the current documentation already implies this should work
- The function crashes rather than behaving in any reasonable way
- Adding "filters must not be empty" to docs would be a poor API design choice

### FEATURE_REQUEST (Why it's NOT a feature request)
- The user isn't asking for new functionality
- They're reporting that existing, documented functionality crashes
- Supporting empty lists is part of robust API design, not a new feature

### Final Assessment: BUG

This is a clear bug where the function fails to handle a valid edge case (empty filter list) that should work according to the function's documented behavior. The fix is simple and the use case is reasonable.
