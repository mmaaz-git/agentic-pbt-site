## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Reproduction Successful

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed with the following observations:

1. **Main Test Case**:
   - Input: `SCHEMA"."VERYLONGTABLENAME` with length limit 20
   - Expected: Result should be ≤ 20 characters
   - Actual: Result is 26 characters (unchanged from input)
   - Bug confirmed: The function returns the original identifier even though it exceeds the length limit

2. **Root Cause Verified**:
   - The function splits the identifier into namespace (`SCHEMA`) and name (`VERYLONGTABLENAME`)
   - It checks only `len(name)` (17) against the limit (20)
   - Since 17 ≤ 20, it returns the original identifier
   - But the full identifier is 26 characters (SCHEMA + "." + VERYLONGTABLENAME), exceeding the limit

3. **Additional Test Cases**:
   - When no namespace is present, truncation works correctly (e.g., `VERYLONGTABLENAME` with limit 10 correctly produces `VERYLO1d9f`)
   - When the table name alone exceeds the limit, it gets truncated but the result still exceeds the total limit (e.g., `SCHEMA"."VERYLONGTABLENAMETHATEXCEEDSLIMIT` with limit 20 produces a 29-character result)

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   The current code (line 293-294 in utils.py):
   ```python
   if length is None or len(name) <= length:
       return identifier
   ```
   This only checks the table name portion, not the complete identifier length.

### Technical Impact

The bug causes the function to violate its documented contract of producing an identifier that fits within the specified length. This is particularly problematic for:
- Oracle databases with a 30-character limit on identifiers
- Any code that relies on `truncate_name` to ensure identifiers fit within database constraints
- Potential database errors when identifiers exceed maximum allowed lengths

The hypothesis test consistently fails, demonstrating this is a reproducible issue whenever a namespace is present and the table name alone fits within the limit but the complete identifier does not.
