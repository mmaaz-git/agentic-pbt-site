BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   REASONS FOR:
   - The code accepts negative width values but crashes when using them
   - The error message is cryptic ("Sign not allowed in string format specifier") and doesn't indicate the real issue
   - The crash happens during execution rather than at construction time (violates fail-fast principle)
   - Input validation is a standard practice for public API parameters
   - The fix is straightforward and improves user experience

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - Could argue that "width" obviously should be positive
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly promise to handle negative values

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
   REASONS FOR:
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly state that negative widths are supported
   - Common sense suggests width should be positive
   - User is passing nonsensical input

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The code does crash with valid Python syntax
   - The constructor accepts the value without complaint
   - The error message is unhelpful and occurs far from the source
   - Python philosophy is "errors should never pass silently"

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   REASONS FOR:
   - Passing negative width is an edge case that wouldn't occur in normal usage
   - Users should know better than to pass negative width
   - The error does eventually surface

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The fix is trivial to implement (2 lines of validation)
   - Good error messages improve developer experience
   - Input validation is a best practice
   - The current error is cryptic and hard to debug

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
   REASONS FOR:
   - Could frame this as "add input validation for width parameter"
   - Documentation doesn't promise to validate inputs

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new features
   - The code currently crashes - this is a bug, not missing functionality
   - Input validation for public APIs is expected behavior

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
   REASONS FOR:
   - The documentation doesn't specify width constraints
   - Could just update docs to say "width must be positive"

   REASONS AGAINST:
   - The code still crashes with an unhelpful error
   - Even with documentation, the constructor should validate inputs
   - The issue is primarily with the code behavior, not documentation

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
----------------
This is clearly a BUG. While one could argue users shouldn't pass negative widths, good API design includes:
1. Input validation at the point of entry (constructor)
2. Clear error messages when validation fails
3. Fail-fast behavior to catch errors early

The current implementation violates all three principles. The fix is simple, improves usability, and prevents cryptic runtime errors. This is exactly the kind of bug that should be fixed in a well-maintained library.
