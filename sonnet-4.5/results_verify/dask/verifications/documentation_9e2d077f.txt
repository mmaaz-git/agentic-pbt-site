## Documentation Analysis

### Official Dask Documentation Review

1. **DataFrame.resample() Documentation**
   - Source: https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/generated/dask.dataframe.DataFrame.resample.html
   - The method is documented as providing "Convenience method for frequency conversion and resampling of time series"
   - Largely copied from pandas' resample implementation
   - Documentation explicitly notes: "Some inconsistencies with the Dask version may exist"

2. **Key Documentation Findings**:

   a) **No Partition Handling Documentation**: The documentation does not specify:
      - How resample handles DataFrame partitions internally
      - What happens when resampling changes the number of partitions
      - Any limitations on partition counts during resampling
      - Expected behavior when output has fewer partitions than input

   b) **Supported Parameters**: Documentation lists supported parameters (rule, closed, label) and explicitly notes several pandas parameters are "Not supported in Dask"

   c) **No Assertion Documentation**: There is no documentation about:
      - Internal assertions that might fail
      - Limitations on the relationship between input and output partition counts
      - The use of RepartitionToFewer class or its requirements

3. **RepartitionToFewer Class** (Internal)
   - This is an internal implementation detail, not part of the public API
   - No user-facing documentation exists for this class
   - The class docstring simply states: "Reduce the partition count"
   - The assertion `assert npartitions_input > npartitions` is an implementation detail

### Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation does not warn users that certain combinations of:
   - Original partition count
   - Time span of data
   - Resample frequency
   Could lead to errors

2. There is no mention that resampling operations might fail with AssertionError when the mathematical relationship between partitions doesn't meet internal requirements

3. The behavior is not explicitly defined for edge cases where resampling would result in equal or fewer time buckets than the number of input partitions

### Conclusion

The documentation provides no indication that the described behavior (AssertionError when resampling) is expected or intentional. The resample operation should handle all valid resampling scenarios transparently, regardless of internal partition management. The assertion failure is an internal implementation detail that should not surface to users, making this a legitimate bug rather than documented/expected behavior.
