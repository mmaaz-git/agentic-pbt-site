Bug Reproduction Results
========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The technical details are correct.

Test Results:
-------------

1. For shape=[1], axis=1 (out of bounds):
   - NumPy raises: AxisError with message "axis 1 is out of bounds for array of dimension 1"
   - Dask raises: IndexError with message "tuple index out of range"

2. For shape=[2, 3], axis=2 (out of bounds):
   - NumPy raises: AxisError with message "axis 2 is out of bounds for array of dimension 2"
   - Dask raises: IndexError with message "tuple index out of range"

3. For shape=[1], axis=-2 (negative out of bounds):
   - NumPy raises: AxisError with message "axis -2 is out of bounds for array of dimension 1"
   - Dask raises: IndexError with message "tuple index out of range"

4. For shape=[2, 1], axis=0 (valid axis but size > 1):
   - NumPy raises: ValueError with message "cannot select an axis to squeeze out which has size not equal to one"
   - Dask raises: ValueError with message "cannot squeeze axis with size other than one"

The hypothesis test from the bug report also fails as described.

Code Analysis:
-------------
I examined the Dask source code at /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/array/routines.py

The issue occurs at line 1949:
```python
if any(a.shape[i] != 1 for i in axis):
    raise ValueError("cannot squeeze axis with size other than one")
```

This line attempts to access a.shape[i] before validate_axis() is called on line 1952. When i is out of bounds, Python raises an IndexError when trying to access the invalid index of the shape tuple.

The proposed fix in the bug report is correct: moving the validate_axis() call before the shape check would ensure proper error handling.

The error messages are also different:
- NumPy's AxisError provides clear information about which axis is out of bounds
- Dask's IndexError provides no context about what went wrong ("tuple index out of range")
