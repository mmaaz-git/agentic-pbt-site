DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function Context:
-----------------
The `_normalize_and_strip_protocol` function is an internal utility function in dask.dataframe.dask_expr.io.parquet. It has no docstring or explicit documentation about its expected behavior.

Function Purpose (inferred from code):
--------------------------------------
1. Accepts a path or list of paths
2. Removes protocol prefixes ("://" or "::")
3. Strips trailing slashes from paths
4. Returns a list of normalized paths

Usage Context:
--------------
The function is used by the ReadParquet class's `normalized_path` property, which then passes the results to:
- pyarrow.fs.FileSelector(path, recursive=True) for directory listing
- fs.get_file_info(path) for file information retrieval

Dask Documentation:
-------------------
From the official Dask documentation:
- Dask supports local and remote filesystem paths (S3, GCS, etc.)
- Remote paths require protocol prefixes (e.g., "s3://")
- Paths can be single files, directories, glob patterns, or lists

PyArrow Documentation:
----------------------
From PyArrow documentation:
- FileSelector expects a valid directory path as base_dir
- The path should be a non-empty string representing a directory
- Empty strings cause errors: "No such file or directory"

Documentation Gaps:
-------------------
1. The _normalize_and_strip_protocol function has no docstring
2. There's no specification about handling edge cases like "/" or protocol-only paths
3. No documentation indicates that empty strings are valid return values
4. The function name suggests it should normalize paths, not produce invalid ones

Conclusion:
-----------
While the function lacks explicit documentation, the usage context and downstream requirements make it clear that returning empty strings violates the implicit contract. The function should produce valid filesystem paths that can be consumed by pyarrow operations.
