DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS: dask.utils.format_bytes

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION (from source code docstring):
   Located in: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py, line 1771-1799

   The docstring states:
   """Format bytes as text

   >>> from dask.utils import format_bytes
   >>> format_bytes(1)
   '1 B'
   >>> format_bytes(1234)
   '1.21 kiB'
   >>> format_bytes(12345678)
   '11.77 MiB'
   >>> format_bytes(1234567890)
   '1.15 GiB'
   >>> format_bytes(1234567890000)
   '1.12 TiB'
   >>> format_bytes(1234567890000000)
   '1.10 PiB'

   For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters.
   """

2. KEY DOCUMENTATION CLAIM:
   Line 1788 explicitly states: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

   This is a clear, unambiguous contract that the function promises to uphold.

3. EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION:
   The Dask API documentation repeats the same claim about the 10-character limit for values < 2**60.

4. ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRACT:
   - The claim is specific and quantifiable: "always <= 10 characters"
   - The domain is clearly defined: "all values < 2**60"
   - This is not a vague statement but a precise mathematical guarantee
   - The word "always" indicates this should hold without exception

5. PURPOSE OF THE GUARANTEE:
   This guarantee appears designed to ensure consistent formatting width, which is useful for:
   - Tabular output alignment
   - Fixed-width displays
   - UI consistency
   - Log formatting

6. CONCLUSION:
   The documentation makes an explicit, unambiguous promise that the implementation fails to keep.
   This is a clear contract violation between the documented API and actual behavior.
   The documentation is not ambiguous, unclear, or subject to interpretation - it states a
   mathematical fact that turns out to be false for certain valid inputs within the specified domain.
