DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR dask.utils.format_bytes

SOURCE CODE LOCATION:
The function is located at /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py, lines 1771-1799.

DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR:
The function's docstring explicitly states:
"For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

This is a clear, unambiguous guarantee about the maximum output length for inputs below 2^60.

FUNCTION PURPOSE:
The function formats byte values into human-readable strings using binary prefixes (kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB). It uses a threshold of 0.9 * unit_size to determine when to switch to the next larger unit.

EXAMPLES PROVIDED:
The docstring provides several examples showing the expected format:
- 1 -> '1 B'
- 1234 -> '1.21 kiB'
- 12345678 -> '11.77 MiB'
- 1234567890 -> '1.15 GiB'
- 1234567890000 -> '1.12 TiB'
- 1234567890000000 -> '1.10 PiB'

All examples shown have outputs of 10 characters or fewer.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
The function uses f-string formatting with ".2f" precision, which always produces 2 decimal places. The format pattern is:
"{value:.2f} {prefix}B"

This results in outputs like "999.99 PiB" (10 chars) or "1000.00 PiB" (11 chars).

KEY FINDING:
The documentation makes an explicit, testable claim about output length that constitutes a contract with users of the function. This is not an implicit expectation or undocumented behavior - it's a specific guarantee stated in the docstring.
