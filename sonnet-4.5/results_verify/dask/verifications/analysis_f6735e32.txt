BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

Considering each possible categorization:

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
-----------------------
Arguments FOR:
✓ The function returns empty strings which cause downstream errors in pyarrow
✓ Empty strings are not valid filesystem paths in any context
✓ The function name "_normalize_and_strip_protocol" implies it should produce normalized, valid paths
✓ The bug has real impact: pyarrow.fs.FileSelector raises errors with empty strings
✓ The fix is straightforward and logical (preserve "/" as minimum path)
✓ Root path "/" is a valid filesystem path that should be preserved

Arguments AGAINST:
- Function has no explicit documentation stating it can't return empty strings
- It's an internal function (starts with underscore)

INVALID
--------
Arguments FOR:
- The function is internal/private (underscore prefix)
- No explicit documentation exists specifying behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
✓ The bug causes actual runtime errors in downstream code
✓ Empty strings are objectively invalid as filesystem paths
✓ The function is actively used in production code paths

WONTFIX
--------
Arguments FOR:
- Edge case inputs like "/" or "file:///" might be considered unusual

Arguments AGAINST:
✓ "/" is the root directory - a fundamental filesystem path
✓ Protocol-only paths like "s3:///" could reasonably appear in user code
✓ The fix is simple and doesn't break any existing functionality

DOCUMENTATION_FIX
-----------------
Arguments FOR:
- The function lacks documentation explaining expected behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
✓ The code behavior is objectively wrong (produces invalid paths)
✓ Adding documentation saying "may return empty strings" wouldn't fix the actual problem
✓ The issue is in the code logic, not documentation

FEATURE_REQUEST
----------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could be seen as requesting new handling for edge cases

Arguments AGAINST:
✓ This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
✓ The current behavior causes errors, not missing features
✓ Path normalization should already handle these basic cases

CONCLUSION
----------
This is clearly a BUG. The function produces invalid output (empty strings) that causes runtime errors in downstream pyarrow operations. The fact that "/" gets stripped to "" is particularly problematic since "/" is the root directory - a fundamental and valid filesystem path. The bug violates the reasonable expectation that path normalization preserves semantic meaning and produces valid paths.
