## Documentation Analysis for dask.bytes.core.read_bytes

### Function Purpose
The `read_bytes` function is part of Dask's internal data ingestion system. It reads bytes from files and returns them as delayed objects, breaking data cleanly by delimiters when provided. It powers user-facing functions like `dd.read_csv` and `db.read_text`.

### Key Documentation Points

1. **blocksize parameter**: Documented as "Chunk size in bytes, defaults to '128 MiB'". The documentation indicates this controls how the data is chunked for reading.

2. **Expected behavior**: The function should "cleanly break data by a delimiter if given" and ensure blocks start/end on delimiter boundaries.

3. **Performance expectations**: There is no explicit documentation about performance characteristics or time complexity requirements. The documentation does not specify:
   - How the function should behave with very small blocksizes
   - What the expected time complexity should be
   - Any warnings about using small blocksizes with large files

4. **Implementation details**: The documentation does not specify HOW the chunking algorithm should work internally, only that it should chunk the data according to the blocksize parameter.

### What the Documentation DOES NOT Say

Critically, the documentation does not specify:
- That the function must complete in reasonable time for all valid input combinations
- Any constraints on the blocksize parameter beyond it being an integer/string
- Performance guarantees or complexity requirements
- That using blocksize=1 with large files should be fast or even practical
- Whether there are recommended minimum blocksize values

### Conclusion
The documentation describes the functional behavior but does not specify performance requirements or implementation details. There's no explicit statement that the function must handle extreme cases like blocksize=1 with large files efficiently.
