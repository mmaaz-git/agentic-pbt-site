## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is an internal utility (not part of the public API) in the `dask.dataframe.io.io` module, and internal functions often have stricter requirements than their docstrings suggest. The docstring examples might be simplified for readability rather than being executable code. Additionally, since this is internal code, the maintainers might expect users to never call this function directly, making the docstring examples more illustrative than prescriptive.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The docstring contains explicit, runnable examples that all use Python lists, creating a clear expectation that lists should work. These aren't pseudocode or conceptual examples - they show exact input/output pairs with the `>>>` prompt indicating interactive Python sessions. When documentation provides concrete examples, users reasonably expect them to work as written.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal function not meant for public use, and the effort to support plain Python lists might not be worthwhile for an internal utility. The function works correctly with the data types it's actually called with internally (pandas/numpy arrays), and adding list support would only benefit users who shouldn't be using this internal function directly anyway.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial (3-4 lines of code) and would make the function more robust. Even internal functions should have accurate documentation, and having non-working examples in docstrings creates confusion for developers who might need to understand or maintain the code. The proposed fix doesn't break any existing functionality.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function works correctly for its intended use cases (pandas/numpy arrays), and the real issue is that the docstring examples are misleading. Updating the examples to use `pd.Series` or `np.array` would accurately reflect the function's requirements without changing any code behavior. This is the most conservative fix that resolves the contradiction.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Using plain lists in examples is more readable and intuitive than requiring imports of pandas/numpy. The docstring examples clearly intend to show the conceptual behavior of the function, and requiring array types in examples would make them less accessible. If the examples were meant to use special types, they would have included the necessary imports.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting plain Python lists would be a new capability that the function doesn't currently have. The function was designed to work with array-like objects that have a `.tolist()` method, and adding list support would be extending its functionality beyond the original design. This would be adding a convenience feature for broader usability.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The docstring examples already show lists being used, suggesting this was intended functionality rather than a new feature. The function's purpose (finding division locations in a sorted sequence) is conceptually applicable to any sequence type, not just arrays. This is fixing broken existing documentation, not adding new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function's docstring provides five examples that all fail with errors when executed. This is a clear contract violation where the documented behavior doesn't match the implementation. Users following the official documentation will encounter errors, which is the definition of a bug. The examples use the `>>>` prompt format, indicating they should be executable Python code.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an internal function not part of the public API, so strict adherence to docstring examples might not be required. The function works correctly for its actual use cases within the Dask codebase. The issue only affects users who are accessing internal functions they shouldn't be using directly. Many internal functions have illustrative rather than executable documentation.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** rather than a bug in the code itself. The function is clearly an internal utility, not part of Dask's public API, as evidenced by its location deep in the module structure (`dask.dataframe.io.io`) and absence from official documentation. Internal functions often have different standards for documentation accuracy, with examples serving to illustrate concepts rather than provide runnable code.

The function works correctly for its intended purpose within Dask's codebase, where it receives pandas Series, numpy arrays, or other array-like objects from other internal operations. The dispatch system's limitation to these types is intentional design, not an oversight. Adding support for plain lists would be unnecessary complexity for an internal function that's never called with lists in actual use.

The most appropriate resolution is to update the docstring examples to use the correct types (pandas Series or numpy arrays) that the function actually supports. This maintains the educational value of the examples while ensuring they're technically accurate. While the proposed code fix is simple, modifying internal functions to support additional types solely for docstring compliance creates maintenance burden without real benefit, especially when users shouldn't be calling these internal functions directly anyway.
