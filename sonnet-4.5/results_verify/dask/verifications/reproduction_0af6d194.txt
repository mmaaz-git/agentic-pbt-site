## Bug Reproduction Results

### Reproduction Successful
The bug report is technically accurate. The `sorted_columns` function does crash with an `IndexError` when given statistics with mismatched column counts across row groups.

### Test Results:

1. **Main Bug Case**: CONFIRMED
   - Input: First row group has 2 columns (col1, col2), second row group has 1 column (col1)
   - Result: `IndexError: list index out of range` at line 422
   - The error occurs exactly as described in the bug report

2. **Property-Based Testing**:
   - The Hypothesis test generated many cases that trigger the IndexError
   - Over 100 seeds were identified that reproduce the failure
   - This confirms the bug occurs frequently with randomly generated mismatched column structures

3. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Empty statistics: Works correctly (returns empty list)
   - Single row group: Works correctly
   - Different column names: Unexpectedly works (but produces incorrect result - uses col2's name with col1's min value)
   - More columns in second row group: Works (only processes first column)
   - Missing min/max with None: Fails with TypeError when comparing None values

### Technical Analysis:

The bug occurs because:
1. Line 418: The function iterates using indices from the first row group: `for i, c in enumerate(statistics[0]["columns"])`
2. Line 422: It then blindly accesses `s["columns"][i]` for all row groups without checking if index `i` exists
3. Line 429: Similar unchecked access to `stats["columns"][i]`

When the second or subsequent row groups have fewer columns than the first, accessing a non-existent index causes an IndexError.

### Behavioral Issues Found:

1. **Primary Bug**: IndexError when row groups have different column counts (fewer columns in later row groups)

2. **Secondary Issue**: When columns have different names at the same index position, the function incorrectly uses the wrong column's statistics (e.g., using col1's min with col2's name)

3. **None Handling**: The function doesn't properly handle None values in min/max fields, leading to TypeError during comparison

The bug report's proposed fix addresses the primary IndexError by checking bounds and column name consistency, which would prevent the crash and the incorrect behavior with mismatched column names.
