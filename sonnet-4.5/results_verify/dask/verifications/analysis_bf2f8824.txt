## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The docstring uses the word "ensure" which implies a guarantee
- The function violates its documented contract in the reported case
- The property-based test correctly identifies the invariant violation
- The issue is reproducible and mathematically demonstrable

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is an internal utility function for visualization, not a public API
- The precision loss (7e-07) is negligible for visualization purposes
- The issue only occurs with extremely large numbers unlikely in practice

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The error is at the ULP level (3 ULPs) which is negligible for visualization
- The function is used for plot bounds where sub-pixel precision is meaningless
- The specific failing case uses unrealistic values (spans of billions)
- Fixing this would require arbitrary-precision arithmetic, adding complexity for no practical benefit
- In actual usage (CPU 0-100%, memory in MB, time in seconds), this issue would never manifest

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The docstring makes a clear promise that is broken
- Property-based testing legitimately found a violation
- The fix is simple (update documentation)

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Floating-point arithmetic inherently has precision limits
- No reasonable user would expect perfect precision with 10-digit numbers
- The function works correctly for its intended use case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug report correctly identifies a real discrepancy
- The test case is valid and the math checks out
- The docstring doesn't mention any precision limitations

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code works correctly for its intended purpose (visualization)
- The issue is that the documentation overpromises with "ensure"
- Simply updating the docstring to note precision limitations would resolve this
- The suggested fix in the bug report is to update documentation
- This is an internal function where exact precision isn't critical

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation accurately describes the intent
- Users of internal functions should understand floating-point limitations

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be reframed as requesting arbitrary-precision arithmetic support
- Could request explicit precision guarantees

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug report identifies existing broken behavior, not requesting new features
- The invariant violation is a bug, not a missing feature

### Final Assessment

This is a classic case where technically correct bug identification meets practical engineering reality. The function:
1. Is internal/undocumented in public API
2. Is used for visualization where ULP-level precision is irrelevant
3. Works correctly for all realistic use cases
4. Only fails with contrived large numbers from property-based testing

The most appropriate classification is **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** because:
- The code functions correctly for its intended purpose
- The issue is the overly strong guarantee in the docstring
- The bug reporter themselves suggests updating documentation as the fix
- The practical impact is zero for actual users
- Changing the code would add unnecessary complexity for no benefit
