## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Case 1: Specific Failing Input from Bug Report
**Input**: `pd.Series([0, 1, 0, 0])` with `chunksize=1`
**Result**:
- Divisions: `[0, 1, 0]`
- Locations: `[0, 4, 4]`
- **Bug Confirmed**: `locations[1] == locations[2] == 4`, violating the invariant that locations should be strictly increasing

### Test Case 2: Hypothesis Testing
The hypothesis test found multiple failures. One example:
- The test asserted that locations must be strictly increasing
- Failed with: `locations[2]=5 >= locations[3]=5`
- This confirms that the function can produce non-monotonic location arrays when given unsorted input

### Test Case 3: Properly Sorted Input
**Input**: `pd.Series([0, 0, 0, 1])` with `chunksize=1`
**Result**:
- Divisions: `[0, 1, 1]`
- Locations: `[0, 3, 4]`
- Locations are strictly increasing: TRUE
- The function works correctly with sorted input

### Technical Analysis of the Bug

The bug occurs because:
1. The function uses `bisect` operations which require sorted input
2. When input is unsorted, the bisect operations produce incorrect indices
3. The function contains this comment at line 288: "# we use bisect later, so we need sorted."
4. However, the function only sorts the unique values (`seq_unique = sorted(set(seq))`) but NOT the original sequence
5. The function then uses `bisect.bisect_left(seq, x)` on the potentially unsorted `seq`, which produces incorrect results

### Root Cause
The function assumes sorted input (as stated in its name and docstring) but:
1. Does not validate this precondition
2. Does not document what happens with unsorted input
3. Silently produces incorrect results instead of failing loudly

### Impact Assessment
- The function is internal (not in public API)
- Internal callers ensure sorted input (e.g., passing `data.index` where monotonic increasing is checked)
- However, the function can be imported directly: `from dask.dataframe.io.io import sorted_division_locations`
- When used incorrectly with unsorted input, it produces invalid results that violate basic invariants
