REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. PROPERTY-BASED TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - Ran the provided Hypothesis test with sample values from 0 to 1000
   - Test FAILED when sample_size=0
   - Error: AssertionError: sample=0 should return bytes, got int
   - This confirms that when sample=0 (integer), the function returns an integer 0 instead of bytes

2. SIMPLE TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - Created a test file with content b'hello world'
   - Called read_bytes(test_file, sample=0, blocksize=None)
   - Confirmed that sample is returned as integer 0 (type: <class 'int'>)
   - Attempting to call .decode('utf-8') on the result raises AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'decode'
   - This confirms the bug as described

3. ADDITIONAL TESTING:
   I tested various sample values to understand the behavior:

   - sample=False → returns False (bool) - this is expected "no sample" behavior
   - sample=0 (int) → returns 0 (int) - THIS IS THE BUG
   - sample=1 (int) → returns b'h' (bytes) - correct behavior
   - sample="0" (str) → returns b'' (bytes) - correct behavior (empty bytes)
   - sample="1 B" (str) → returns b'h' (bytes) - correct behavior

4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   The bug occurs at line 163 in dask/bytes/core.py:
   ```python
   if sample:
   ```

   This condition treats 0 as falsy (since bool(0) == False), so when sample=0:
   - The code skips the sample processing block entirely
   - The original value (integer 0) is returned unchanged
   - This violates the documented return type of bytes

   When sample is a string "0", it's truthy, so it enters the block, gets parsed to 0, and correctly reads 0 bytes, returning b''.

5. IMPACT:
   - Any code expecting bytes from read_bytes will break when sample=0
   - This is a type contract violation - the function promises to return bytes but returns int
   - The bug is deterministic and consistently reproducible
