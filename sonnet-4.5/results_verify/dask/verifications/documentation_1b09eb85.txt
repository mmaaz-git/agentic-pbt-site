## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation Review

The `apply_filters` function's docstring states:

**Parameters:**
- `filters`: Union[List[Tuple[str, str, Any]], List[List[Tuple[str, str, Any]]]]
  - Described as "List of filters to apply"
  - Can be in DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) or simple list of tuples

**Returns:**
- "parts, statistics: the same as the input, but possibly a subset"

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **Empty List Handling Not Specified**: The documentation does not explicitly state what happens when `filters` is an empty list `[]`. However, it says the function returns "the same as the input, but possibly a subset", which strongly implies that with no filters, all input should be returned unchanged.

2. **None vs Empty List**: The external Dask documentation for `read_parquet` indicates that `filters=None` means no filtering. By logical extension, an empty filter list `[]` should also mean no filtering.

3. **"Possibly a subset" Interpretation**: The phrase "possibly a subset" in the return documentation clearly indicates that the function may return:
   - The full input (when no filters match or are applied)
   - A subset of the input (when filters exclude some parts)

   This supports the expectation that an empty filter list should return the full input.

4. **No Warning About Empty Lists**: Neither the function's docstring nor the external documentation warns users that empty filter lists will cause errors. This is a reasonable use case where filters might be built conditionally and could end up empty.

### Conclusion
The documentation supports the bug report's claim. An empty filter list is a valid input that should return all parts unchanged, not crash with an IndexError. The current behavior violates the documented contract that the function returns "the same as the input, but possibly a subset."
