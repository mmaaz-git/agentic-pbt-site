DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR dask.dataframe.tseries.resample._resample_series

1. FUNCTION PURPOSE:
The _resample_series function is an internal/private function (indicated by the leading underscore) in the dask.dataframe.tseries.resample module. It performs resampling operations on pandas Series objects as part of dask's distributed resampling implementation.

2. DOCUMENTATION STATUS:
- This is an INTERNAL function - no public API documentation exists for _resample_series
- The function has no docstring
- Parent class Resampler has minimal documentation stating it exposes "an API similar to Pandas' Resampler for dask-expr"
- Public-facing resample() method documentation mentions that for 'ME', 'QE', 'YE' frequencies, the default closed='right' and label='right'

3. PANDAS RESAMPLE BEHAVIOR (Reference Implementation):
According to pandas documentation:
- resample() can create indices at anchor points (month-end, quarter-end, year-end) that fall outside the original data's precise time range
- For 'ME', 'QE', 'YE' frequencies, indices are created at the calendar period boundaries
- Example: Data from Jan 1-10 resampled to 'ME' creates an index at Jan 31, even though Jan 31 is outside the original data range

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Since dask aims to replicate pandas behavior for dataframe operations:
- The function should handle anchor-based frequencies ('ME', 'QE', 'YE') the same way pandas does
- It should allow indices at anchor points even when they fall outside [start, end] range
- The error message mentions "This can often be resolved by using larger partitions" suggesting this is a known limitation

5. KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- No documentation explicitly states that _resample_series should reject anchor-based frequencies on short data spans
- The error message itself suggests workarounds rather than stating this is invalid usage
- The function is internal/private, so its behavior is implementation detail, not public API
- However, this internal function is called by the public resample API, so failures here affect users
