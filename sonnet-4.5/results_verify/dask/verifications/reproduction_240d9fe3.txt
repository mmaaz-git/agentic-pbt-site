## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Confirmation
I have successfully reproduced the bug. The function `sorted_division_locations` indeed fails when given plain Python lists, despite the docstring explicitly showing examples with lists.

### Test Results:

1. **All docstring examples fail with lists:**
   - `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']` with `chunksize=2` → TypeError
   - `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']` with `chunksize=3` → TypeError
   - `['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C']` with `chunksize=3` → TypeError
   - `['A']` with `chunksize=2` → TypeError

2. **Error Message:**
   ```
   TypeError: No dispatch for <class 'list'>
   ```
   This occurs at line 284 in sorted_division_locations when it calls `seq = tolist(seq)`

3. **Works with other types:**
   - NumPy arrays: ✓ Works correctly
   - Pandas Series: ✓ Works correctly
   - Plain lists: ✗ Fails with TypeError

### Root Cause Verification:
The bug occurs because:
1. The function checks `if isinstance(seq, list):` and passes through unchanged if true
2. Otherwise, it calls `tolist(seq)` to convert the input to a list
3. The `tolist` function uses a dispatch system that only has handlers registered for numpy/pandas types
4. There is no handler for plain `list` type, causing the TypeError

### Fix Verification:
I tested the suggested fix by registering a handler for list/tuple types:
```python
@tolist_dispatch.register((list, tuple))
def tolist_list_or_tuple(obj):
    return list(obj)
```

With this fix applied:
- All docstring examples work correctly and produce the expected output
- The function handles both lists and tuples properly
- The results match exactly what the documentation promises

### Technical Details:
- The bug is 100% reproducible
- The error occurs consistently for any list input
- The suggested fix completely resolves the issue
- The fix is minimal and doesn't affect existing functionality for numpy/pandas types
