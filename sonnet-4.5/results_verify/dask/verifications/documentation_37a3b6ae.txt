DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Dask Documentation:
-------------------
The official Dask documentation (both online and in the docstring) explicitly states:

"Note that unlike in pandas, the reset index for a Dask DataFrame will not be monotonically increasing from 0. Instead, it will restart at 0 for each partition (e.g. index1 = [0, ..., 10], index2 = [0, ...])."

The documentation further explains: "This is due to the inability to statically know the full length of the index."

This behavior is:
- Explicitly documented
- Intentionally different from pandas
- Justified by technical limitations of distributed computing

Pandas Documentation:
---------------------
Pandas reset_index() creates a "default integer index" that is:
- Sequential starting from 0
- Monotonically increasing
- Unique across all rows

Key Finding:
------------
The behavior described in the bug report is NOT a bug, but rather the documented and intentional behavior of Dask. The documentation clearly warns users that:
1. The behavior differs from pandas
2. Each partition will restart its index at 0
3. This is a known limitation due to the distributed nature of Dask

The bug report's assumption that Dask should match pandas behavior is incorrect. Dask explicitly documents that it cannot and does not match pandas behavior for reset_index() due to technical constraints of distributed computing.
