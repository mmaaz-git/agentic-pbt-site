DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION REVIEW:

1. dask.dataframe.read_orc:
   - Documentation states that `index` parameter is "Column name to set as index"
   - No mention of how indices are handled when reading files without an index column
   - No specification of round-trip behavior
   - No mention of what happens when multiple partitions are read without an index

2. dask.dataframe.to_orc:
   - Documentation states `write_index` parameter: "Whether or not to write the index. Defaults to True."
   - When `write_index=False`, documentation says the index is not written
   - No specification of what users should expect when reading back data written without index
   - No warning about potential duplicate indices in multi-partition scenarios

3. SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS:
   - In to_orc() at line 180: When `write_index=False`, the code does `df = df.reset_index(drop=True)`
   - This resets the index for the entire dataframe before partitioning
   - Each partition then gets written with its local portion of the reset index
   - No mechanism in read_orc() to reconstruct a global sequential index

4. EXISTING TEST COVERAGE:
   - Found test in test_orc.py that uses `write_index=False`
   - The test uses `assert_eq(data, df2, check_index=False)` - explicitly NOT checking the index!
   - This suggests the developers are aware that indices might not match

KEY DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
1. No specification of expected round-trip behavior when `write_index=False`
2. No warning about duplicate indices in multi-partition scenarios
3. No guidance on whether users should expect index preservation or recreation
4. The behavior is not documented as intentional or expected

COMPARISON WITH SIMILAR OPERATIONS:
- Checked Parquet documentation: Similar lack of specification
- This appears to be an under-documented area across Dask's file I/O operations

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly state what the expected behavior should be when performing a round-trip with `write_index=False`. This is a significant documentation gap that leaves the behavior undefined.
