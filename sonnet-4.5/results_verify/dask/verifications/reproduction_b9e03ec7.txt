REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug as reported. The issue occurs exactly as described in the bug report.

## Test Results

1. **Direct Reproduction**: When calling `apply_filters(parts=['part1'], statistics=[{'columns': []}], filters=[])`, the function crashes with an `IndexError: list index out of range` at line 556.

2. **Root Cause**: The error occurs at line 556:
   ```python
   conjunction, *disjunction = filters if isinstance(filters[0], list) else [filters]
   ```
   This line attempts to access `filters[0]` without first checking if the filters list is empty.

3. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test from the bug report also fails with the same error, confirming the issue is reproducible across different inputs.

4. **Contrast with Non-Empty Filters**: When filters are provided (e.g., `[('x', '>', 8)]`), the function works correctly.

## Error Analysis

The crash happens because:
- Line 556 tries to access `filters[0]` to check if it's a list
- When `filters = []`, accessing `filters[0]` raises an IndexError
- The code doesn't handle the empty filters case before attempting this access

## Expected Behavior

Based on the function's docstring which states it returns "the same as the input, but possibly a subset", an empty filter list should logically return all input parts and statistics unchanged, as no filtering criteria have been specified.

The bug is 100% reproducible and the report accurately describes both the problem and its location in the code.
