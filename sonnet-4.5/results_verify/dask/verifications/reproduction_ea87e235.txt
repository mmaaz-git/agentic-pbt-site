## Bug Reproduction Results

### Bug Report Claims
The bug report claims that `ndeepmap(n, func, seq)` silently discards all elements except the first when `n <= 0` and `seq` is a list with multiple elements.

### Reproduction Results

#### Test 1: Basic Data Loss
- Input: `ndeepmap(0, identity, [10, 20, 30])`
- Expected (reasonable): Either apply function to whole list, or apply to each element, or raise error
- Actual Result: `10` (only first element)
- **CONFIRMED**: Elements [20, 30] are silently discarded

#### Test 2: Elements Beyond First Are Ignored
- Input 1: `ndeepmap(0, identity, [10, 20, 30])` → Result: `10`
- Input 2: `ndeepmap(0, identity, [10, 999, 999])` → Result: `10`
- **CONFIRMED**: Modifying elements after the first has no effect on the result

#### Test 3: Function Application
- Input: `ndeepmap(0, inc, [1, 2, 3])`
- Result: `2` (which is inc(1))
- **CONFIRMED**: Function is only applied to the first element, others ignored

#### Test 4: Empty List Handling
- Input: `ndeepmap(0, identity, [])`
- Result: Raises `IndexError: list index out of range`
- **ADDITIONAL BUG**: The function crashes on empty lists instead of handling them gracefully

#### Test 5: Negative n Values
- Input: `ndeepmap(-1, identity, [1, 2, 3])`
- Result: `1` (only first element)
- **CONFIRMED**: Negative n values also exhibit the same data loss behavior

### Code Analysis
The problematic code is in lines 315-316 of dask/utils.py:
```python
elif isinstance(seq, list):
    return func(seq[0])
```

When n <= 0 and seq is a list, the function:
1. Accesses only `seq[0]` (the first element)
2. Applies the function to only that element
3. Returns the result
4. Never touches or processes `seq[1:]`

### Existing Test Coverage
The existing test in test_utils.py only tests:
- `ndeepmap(0, inc, 1)` - scalar input
- `ndeepmap(0, inc, [1])` - single-element list

These tests don't reveal the bug because:
- With a scalar, no list indexing occurs
- With a single-element list, `seq[0]` is the entire content anyway

### Technical Accuracy of Bug Report
1. **Silent data loss**: ✓ CONFIRMED - Elements beyond the first are discarded without warning
2. **Behavior description**: ✓ ACCURATE - The code does exactly what the report claims
3. **Property test**: ✓ VALID - The hypothesis test correctly demonstrates the bug
4. **Examples**: ✓ CORRECT - All examples produce the claimed results

The bug report is technically accurate and the bug is reproducible exactly as described.
