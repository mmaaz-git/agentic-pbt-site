## Bug Reproduction Report

### Test Execution Summary

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The test results confirm the issue:

1. **Simple Reproduction Case**:
   - When calling `_normalize_index_columns(None, ['0'], None, ['0'])`
   - The function returns: `column_names=['0']` and `index_names=['0']`
   - This creates an intersection `{'0'}` between columns and indices
   - This overlap is problematic as it means the same name appears in both columns and indices

2. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The property-based test failed with the exact example cited in the bug report
   - Input: `user_columns=None, data_columns=['0'], user_index=None, data_index=['0']`
   - The test correctly identifies that the intersection should be empty but found `{'0'}`

3. **Contrast with User-Specified Overlap**:
   - When users explicitly specify overlapping columns/indices (e.g., both containing '0')
   - The function correctly raises: `ValueError: Specified index and column names must not intersect`
   - This shows inconsistent behavior between user-specified and data-provided parameters

### Code Analysis

I examined the actual implementation in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/io/parquet/utils.py`:

- Lines 347-348: When both user columns and index are specified, the function checks for intersection and raises a ValueError if found
- Lines 349-352: When neither user columns nor index are specified (both None), the function simply returns `data_columns` and `data_index` without any validation
- Lines 332-341: When only one is specified, the function removes overlaps by filtering

The bug is in the else block (lines 349-352) which doesn't check for or handle overlapping names when using defaults from the data.

### Effect of the Bug

This bug creates data ambiguity:
1. A field name '0' appears in both the column list and index list
2. This could lead to confusion about whether '0' is a data column or an index column
3. Downstream operations that rely on distinct column/index names may behave unexpectedly
4. The inconsistency means that data-provided overlaps are silently accepted while user-specified overlaps are rejected
