## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Categorization Considerations

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The code accepts negative dt values without validation, then crashes during execution
- This violates the principle of fail-fast: invalid inputs should be rejected at the boundary
- The error occurs in a background process, making debugging harder for users
- The fix is straightforward: add input validation in __init__
- Other profiling tools typically validate time intervals at construction

**Arguments Against:**
- Could be considered obvious that time intervals should be positive
- The error message "sleep length must be non-negative" is clear about the issue

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- It's "obvious" that a time interval for periodic sampling should be positive
- The parameter name "dt" (delta time) inherently implies positive values
- No reasonable use case exists for negative sampling intervals

**Arguments Against:**
- The API accepts the value without complaint
- Documentation doesn't explicitly forbid negative values
- Users shouldn't have to guess what's valid based on parameter names alone
- The crash happens in a background process, not immediately

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- This is an obscure edge case - users wouldn't normally pass negative time intervals
- The error eventually surfaces with a clear message
- Adding validation for every "obviously wrong" input could bloat the codebase

**Arguments Against:**
- This is a clear API design issue that should be fixed
- The delayed failure mode is problematic for debugging
- Adding a simple validation check is minimal overhead

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be framed as "add input validation for dt parameter"
- The current code works as designed (crashes when given nonsensical input)

**Arguments Against:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Accepting invalid input that causes crashes is a bug, not a missing feature

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The code technically works - it crashes with invalid input as expected
- Could just document that dt must be positive

**Arguments Against:**
- The code behavior itself is problematic (accepts invalid input then crashes)
- Documentation alone wouldn't fix the poor user experience
- Input validation is a better solution than documenting restrictions

### Analysis Summary

This issue represents a genuine bug in input validation. The ResourceProfiler class accepts invalid negative dt values that will inevitably cause crashes when used. The error manifests in a background process, making it harder to debug. While one could argue that negative time intervals are "obviously" invalid, good API design principles dictate that:

1. Invalid inputs should be rejected at the API boundary
2. Errors should occur as close to the source as possible
3. APIs should validate their contracts explicitly

The proposed fix (adding validation in __init__) is simple, appropriate, and follows standard practices. This is not merely a documentation issue or an obscure edge case - it's a straightforward input validation bug that should be fixed.
