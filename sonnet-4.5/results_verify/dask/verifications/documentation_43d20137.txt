DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR dask.diagnostics.progress.ProgressBar._update_bar
=============================================================================

Public Documentation Found:
---------------------------
The public documentation for ProgressBar (found in the docstring and online docs) describes:
- ProgressBar as "A progress bar for dask"
- Parameters: minimum, width, dt, out
- Usage examples showing it as a context manager
- General behavior for displaying computation progress

However, the documentation does NOT specify:
- Internal implementation details of _update_bar (it's a private method with _ prefix)
- Structure requirements for the state dictionary
- Which keys must be present in the state dictionary
- How incomplete state dictionaries should be handled
- Error handling behavior for malformed state

Code Analysis:
--------------
The _update_bar method is a PRIVATE internal method (indicated by the underscore prefix). This method:
1. Is not part of the public API
2. Is called internally by the _timer_func and _finish methods
3. Expects a state dictionary with specific keys: "finished", "ready", "waiting", "running"
4. Already has defensive code for empty/None state (line 133: "if not s:")

Related Code Context:
--------------------
Looking at dask/local.py:222-232, the normal scheduler creates state dictionaries with all required keys:
- "finished": set()
- "ready": list
- "waiting": dict
- "running": set()
Plus additional keys like "dependencies", "dependents", "cache", etc.

Key Observation:
----------------
The _update_bar method is designed to work with state dictionaries created by dask's internal schedulers. It's a private implementation detail that expects a specific internal structure. The method name starting with underscore indicates it's not meant to be called directly by users.

The existing defensive check (if not s:) shows awareness of edge cases, but the implementation assumes that if a state dict exists, it will have the standard structure created by dask's schedulers.
