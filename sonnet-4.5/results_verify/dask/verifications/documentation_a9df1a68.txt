## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `_aggregate_stats` function has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Utility to aggregate the statistics for N row-groups into a single dictionary. Used by `Engine._construct_parts`"
- No explicit documentation about the expected format of returned column statistics

### Internal Function Status
`_aggregate_stats` is an internal utility function (prefixed with underscore) that is not part of the public API. It is used internally by the parquet reading infrastructure in Dask.

### Expected Column Statistics Format
Based on code analysis and usage patterns in dask/dataframe/io/parquet/:

1. **Normal column statistics structure** (observed in lines 505-511, 520-526):
   ```python
   {
       "name": <column_name>,
       "min": <min_value>,
       "max": <max_value>,
       "null_count": <null_count>
   }
   ```

2. **Problematic structure** (lines 503, 518):
   ```python
   {"null_count": <null_count>}  # Missing 'name', 'min', 'max' fields
   ```

### Consumer Expectations
The `sorted_columns` function (and potentially other consumers) expects:
1. All column statistics to have a 'name' field (line 419, 443 in core.py)
2. Statistics to optionally have 'min' and 'max' fields (checked on line 421-423)

### Documentation Gaps
1. No formal specification of the column statistics dictionary structure
2. No documentation about the "dangerous stats" case (min == max with nulls)
3. No contract specified between `_aggregate_stats` and its consumers

### Conclusion
While there is no explicit documentation stating that all column statistics MUST have a 'name' field, the code pattern and usage throughout the codebase clearly establishes this as an implicit requirement. The `sorted_columns` function unconditionally accesses `c["name"]` when the `columns` parameter is provided, indicating this is an expected invariant.

The comment in the code "Remove dangerous stats (min == max, but null values exist)" suggests the intent is to exclude certain statistics, but the implementation is incomplete - it removes the min/max fields but fails to maintain the required 'name' field that downstream code depends on.
