DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS REPORT
=============================

## Documentation Sources Reviewed:

1. **Class Docstring** (lines 298-348 in profile.py)
   - States CacheProfiler is "A profiler for dask execution at the scheduler cache level"
   - Records: Key, Task, Size metric, Cache entry time, Cache exit time
   - Shows examples of single computation usage
   - No mention of behavior with multiple computations or partial graphs

2. **Dask Official Documentation** (https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/diagnostics-local.html)
   - Describes callback signatures but does not specify whether 'dsk' is full or partial
   - No explicit documentation about multi-computation scenarios
   - No specification about task graph completeness in callbacks

3. **Callback Base Class Documentation** (callbacks.py)
   - Defines callback signatures but doesn't specify graph completeness requirements
   - Shows that callbacks receive 'dsk' parameter but doesn't define its scope

## Key Documentation Findings:

### What IS documented:
- CacheProfiler tracks cache-level metrics during execution
- The _start method receives a dsk parameter
- The _posttask and _finish methods receive dsk parameters
- The class maintains internal state including self._dsk and self._cache

### What is NOT documented:
- **Whether dsk parameter in callbacks should be complete or partial**
- **Expected behavior when profiling multiple sequential computations**
- **The relationship between dsk parameter and self._dsk**
- **How CacheProfiler should handle tasks from previous computations**
- **The purpose of accumulating graphs in self._dsk via update()**

## Code Analysis Reveals Design Intent:

1. **self._dsk accumulation pattern** (line 370):
   ```python
   def _start(self, dsk):
       self._dsk.update(dsk)
   ```
   This clearly shows intention to accumulate all task definitions across multiple calls

2. **Visualization dependency** (line 388-394):
   The _plot method uses self._dsk for visualization, suggesting it needs the complete graph history

3. **Similar pattern in base Profiler class** (line 76-77):
   Regular Profiler also maintains self._dsk with update() pattern

## Design Inconsistency:

The code shows a clear design pattern where:
- self._dsk is meant to accumulate ALL task definitions across executions
- dsk parameter represents the CURRENT computation's graph
- But lines 377 and 382 incorrectly use dsk instead of self._dsk

## Documentation Gap:

The documentation does not explicitly state that:
1. Callbacks may receive partial graphs in sequential computations
2. CacheProfiler is designed to handle multiple computations with accumulated state
3. The self._dsk member is specifically for maintaining complete task history

However, the code structure with self._dsk.update() clearly indicates this is the intended design.

## Conclusion:

While the documentation doesn't explicitly specify the behavior for partial graphs, the code design pattern strongly suggests that:
1. self._dsk is intentionally accumulating all tasks
2. The dsk parameter may be partial (current computation only)
3. The bug is a genuine implementation error, not a documentation issue

The lack of explicit documentation about this behavior doesn't make the bug invalid - the code's internal design clearly shows the intended behavior that is not being followed.
