## Documentation Analysis

### Dask Documentation

The dask.bag.Bag.var method documentation is minimal:
- Method signature: `var(self, ddof=0)`
- Docstring: Simply states "Variance"
- No explicit documentation about valid ddof values or expected behavior when ddof >= n

### NumPy Convention (Industry Standard)

Since Dask aims to provide a distributed computing alternative to NumPy, it should follow NumPy's conventions:

1. **NumPy Documentation**:
   - ddof parameter: "Delta Degrees of Freedom: the divisor used in the calculation is N - ddof"
   - Default value: 0 (population variance)
   - Common use: ddof=1 for sample variance (Bessel's correction)

2. **NumPy Behavior**:
   - Returns `inf` when ddof >= n (with RuntimeWarning about division by zero)
   - Never returns negative variance values
   - Provides warnings about degrees of freedom <= 0 for slice

3. **Pandas Behavior**:
   - Returns `nan` when ddof >= n
   - Never returns negative variance values

### Mathematical Definition

Variance is mathematically defined as:
- The expected value of the squared deviation from the mean
- Always non-negative by definition (square of real numbers is always >= 0)
- Formula: Var(X) = E[(X - μ)²]

### Documentation Gap

The Dask documentation does not specify:
1. Valid ranges for ddof parameter
2. Expected behavior when ddof >= n
3. Whether it follows NumPy's conventions

However, given that:
- Dask is designed as a parallel computing library that extends NumPy/Pandas APIs
- The parameter name and default value match NumPy exactly
- Users would reasonably expect similar behavior to NumPy

The lack of explicit documentation doesn't excuse returning mathematically impossible negative variance values.

### Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that variance must be non-negative or how to handle edge cases, this is a fundamental mathematical property that doesn't need to be documented. The bug violates basic mathematical principles and differs from established library behaviors (NumPy/Pandas), making it a legitimate bug rather than a documentation issue.
