## Documentation Analysis for _resample_bin_and_out_divs

### Function Documentation
The function `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` has no docstring and is an internal function (indicated by the leading underscore). This is a private implementation detail of the dask.dataframe.tseries.resample module.

### Dask Divisions Requirements (from official documentation)
According to the official Dask documentation:

1. **Divisions Definition**: "Tuple of npartitions + 1 values, in ascending order, marking the lower/upper bounds of each partition's index" (from dask.dataframe.DataFrame.divisions documentation)

2. **Sorted Requirement**: Divisions MUST be in ascending order. This is a fundamental invariant that enables Dask to:
   - Know which partition contains a given value
   - Optimize operations like loc, merge, and groupby
   - Perform efficient algorithms when the index is sorted

3. **Violations Cause Errors**: When divisions are not sorted, Dask raises ValueError: "divisions must be sorted" or "Partitions must be sorted ascending with the index"

### Resample Functionality Requirements
For time series resampling in Dask:
- DataFrames must have known divisions
- Divisions must be properly sorted by datetime index
- The resample operation relies on sorted divisions to create cleanly-divided partitions

### What the Function Should Do
The `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` function is responsible for:
1. Taking input divisions from a time series DataFrame
2. Computing new divisions after resampling with a given rule (e.g., 'W' for weekly)
3. Returning both `newdivs` and `outdivs` tuples

### Key Finding
The documentation clearly states divisions must ALWAYS be "in ascending order". This is not optional - it's a fundamental requirement of the Dask DataFrame architecture. Any function that returns divisions must ensure they are sorted, as downstream operations depend on this invariant.
