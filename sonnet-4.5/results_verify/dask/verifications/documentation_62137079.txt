Documentation Analysis for dask.sizeof Function
================================================

## Official Documentation Findings

1. **Purpose of sizeof**:
   - The sizeof function computes the size of an object in bytes
   - Used internally by Dask to determine which objects to spill to disk during memory management
   - Part of Dask's memory optimization strategy

2. **Registration Mechanism**:
   - Uses a dispatcher pattern via `@sizeof.register(type)` decorator
   - Allows custom implementations for different object types
   - Third-party libraries can register via entry points under group "dask.sizeof"

3. **Return Type Contract**:
   The documentation DOES NOT explicitly specify what type sizeof should return. It only states:
   - "Must return the object's size in bytes"
   - Examples show returning `array.nbytes` or similar numeric values
   - No explicit mention that it must be Python int vs numpy integer types

4. **Test Suite Evidence**:
   In dask/tests/test_sizeof.py lines 65-67, there are explicit assertions:
   ```python
   assert isinstance(sizeof(df), int)
   assert isinstance(sizeof(df.x), int)
   assert isinstance(sizeof(df.index), int)
   ```

   These test assertions establish an implicit contract that sizeof should return Python int type.
   However, note that `isinstance(x, int)` returns True for numpy integer types as well in NumPy >= 1.x,
   since numpy integers inherit from Python int.

5. **Implementation Patterns**:
   Looking at the source code (dask/sizeof.py), most implementations wrap return values with `int()`:
   - Line 107: `return int(x.nbytes)`  # cupy arrays
   - Line 116: `return int(x.nbytes)`  # numba arrays
   - Line 128: `return int(x.nbytes)`  # rmm buffers
   - Line 140: `return int(x.nbytes)`  # numpy arrays (regular path)
   - Line 139: `return xs.nbytes`     # numpy arrays (broadcast path) - NO int() wrapper

6. **Consistency Pattern**:
   The codebase shows a clear pattern of wrapping nbytes with int() for consistency, except for line 139.

## Key Finding

The documentation does not explicitly require sizeof to return Python int vs numpy integer types.
The requirement is inferred from:
1. Test suite assertions using isinstance(result, int)
2. Consistent implementation pattern of wrapping with int() in most paths
3. The fact that line 140 wraps with int() but line 139 doesn't appears to be an oversight

The bug report's claim about "contract violation" is based on implicit expectations from the test suite
and implementation patterns, not explicit documentation requirements.
