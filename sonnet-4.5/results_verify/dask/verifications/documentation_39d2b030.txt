## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation

The check_index function has a docstring that describes its purpose as "Check validity of index for a given dimension". The docstring includes several examples showing various use cases.

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **Function Purpose**: The documentation clearly states this function checks the validity of indices for array dimensions.

2. **Boolean Array Examples in Documentation**:
   Interestingly, the function's own docstring examples demonstrate the bug:

   ```python
   >>> check_index(0, [True, True, True], 1)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   IndexError: Boolean array with size 3 is not long enough for axis 0 with size 1
   ```

   This example shows a boolean array of size 3 being used with a dimension of size 1, and the documented error message incorrectly says "not long enough" when mathematically 3 > 1 means the array is too long.

3. **No Specification of Error Message Requirements**:
   - The documentation does not explicitly specify what the error messages should say
   - The documentation does not mandate that error messages must distinguish between "too short" and "too long"
   - However, the examples in the docstring do show the current (misleading) error messages

4. **Boolean Array Indexing Requirements**:
   - The documentation implicitly shows that boolean arrays must have the exact same size as the dimension
   - When sizes don't match, an IndexError should be raised
   - The specific wording of the error message is not prescribed by any specification

### Documentation vs Implementation

The documentation's examples actually reflect the current buggy implementation. This suggests that either:
1. The documentation was auto-generated from the code's actual output (doctests)
2. The documentation was written to match the existing implementation without considering the semantic incorrectness

### Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly specify what error messages should say, the principle of providing clear, accurate, and helpful error messages is a fundamental expectation in software development. The current error message is semantically incorrect and misleading when the array is too long, which violates the implicit contract of providing useful debugging information to users.
