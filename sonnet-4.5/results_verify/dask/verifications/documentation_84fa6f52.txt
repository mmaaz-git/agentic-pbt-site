## Documentation Analysis for FromArray._column_indices

After examining the source code and available documentation for dask.dataframe.dask_expr.io.io.FromArray, I found:

1. **No explicit documentation for column ordering behavior**: The FromArray class lacks comprehensive docstrings or documentation that explicitly states how column ordering should be handled when a subset of columns is requested in a specific order.

2. **Class purpose**: FromArray appears to be an internal class used to create Dask DataFrames from numpy arrays. It accepts parameters including:
   - frame: the numpy array
   - chunksize: chunk size for partitioning
   - original_columns: the original column names
   - columns: optional subset of columns to select
   - meta: metadata

3. **Column selection implementation**: Looking at the code:
   - Line 656-657: When columns are specified, the metadata is indexed with `meta[self.operand("columns")]`, which would preserve the order of requested columns in the metadata
   - Line 669-676: The `_column_indices` property returns indices by iterating through original_columns and checking membership in requested columns
   - Line 711: The data is sliced using these indices: `data[:, self._column_indices]`
   - Line 717: The metadata columns are used when constructing the Task

4. **No specification found**: There is no documentation that explicitly states whether:
   - Column order should be preserved when selecting a subset
   - The indices should match the order of requested columns vs. original columns
   - This is intended behavior or an oversight

5. **Pandas compatibility expectation**: Given that Dask DataFrames are meant to be compatible with pandas DataFrames, users would reasonably expect that requesting columns in a specific order would preserve that order, as it does in pandas:
   ```python
   df[['c', 'a']]  # In pandas, this returns columns in order 'c', 'a'
   ```

The lack of explicit documentation about column ordering behavior makes it difficult to determine if this is a bug or unspecified behavior. However, the principle of least surprise and pandas compatibility suggests that column order should be preserved.
