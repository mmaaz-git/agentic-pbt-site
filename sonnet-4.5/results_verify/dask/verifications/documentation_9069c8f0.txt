## Documentation Analysis

### Key Findings

1. **Documented Pandas Compatibility**
   - The Dask resample implementation uses the `@derived_from(pd_Resampler)` decorator throughout
   - This decorator indicates the method is "derived from" the pandas implementation
   - The official documentation states the docstring is "copied from pandas.core.frame.DataFrame.resample"
   - However, it explicitly notes: "Some inconsistencies with the Dask version may exist"

2. **Explicit Limitations**
   - Several pandas parameters are NOT supported: axis, convention, kind, on, level, origin (partially), offset, group_keys
   - Requires datetime-like index (DatetimeIndex, PeriodIndex, or TimedeltaIndex)
   - Requires known divisions (as verified in the code: raises ValueError if divisions[0] is None)

3. **No Documentation of Partition Reduction Issues**
   - The documentation does NOT mention any limitation regarding:
     - Resampling when output has fewer time bins than input partitions
     - Restrictions on the relationship between number of partitions and resample frequency
     - Any requirement that output partitions must be less than input partitions

4. **Expected Behavior Based on Documentation**
   - The documentation implies Dask should handle resampling operations similarly to pandas
   - The use of `@derived_from` decorator suggests the methods should behave like their pandas counterparts
   - Nothing in the documentation indicates that an AssertionError should be raised when resampling to coarser frequencies

### Conclusion
The documentation does not describe the limitation that causes the reported bug. While it acknowledges "some inconsistencies may exist," it does not document that resampling will fail with an AssertionError when the output frequency results in fewer bins than the number of input partitions. This is a legitimate gap between expected (pandas-like) behavior and actual implementation.
