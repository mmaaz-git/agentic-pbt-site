DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Function Purpose

The `sorted_columns` function is an internal utility in dask.dataframe.io.parquet.core that:
- Finds columns that are sorted in parquet row-group statistics
- Returns appropriate divisions for those sorted columns
- Is used internally to optimize parquet file reading

## Documentation Review

1. **Function Docstring**:
   - States: "Find sorted columns given row-group statistics"
   - Returns: "List of {'name': str, 'divisions': List[str]} dictionaries"
   - Does not specify behavior when statistics contain None values

2. **Public Documentation**:
   - No public documentation found for `sorted_columns` - it's an internal function
   - Parent functionality (read_parquet) documentation doesn't mention None handling in statistics
   - The calculate_divisions parameter documentation mentions using "min/max statistics from footer metadata"

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The function already has logic to handle None values (line 430-432)
   - It checks if c["min"] is None and sets success=False
   - The intent is clearly to skip columns with incomplete statistics
   - However, the implementation misses checking c["max"] and the previous row's max

## Documentation Gaps

1. The function doesn't document:
   - What happens with None values in statistics
   - Whether partial statistics (some None, some values) are valid input
   - The requirement that both min AND max must be non-None for comparisons

2. The bug represents a gap between intended behavior (skip incomplete statistics) and implementation (crashes on None max values).

## Conclusion

This is not a documentation issue - the function's intent is clear from its existing logic. It tries to handle None values but has an incomplete implementation. The documentation doesn't need to specify this edge case because it's an internal function, and the correct behavior (skipping incomplete statistics) is evident from the existing code structure.
