DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Key Documentation Findings

1. **Dask DataFrame reset_index Documentation**:
   The official Dask documentation for `reset_index` explicitly states:

   "Note that unlike in pandas, the reset index for a Dask DataFrame will not be monotonically increasing from 0. Instead, it will restart at 0 for each partition (e.g. index1 = [0, ..., 10], index2 = [0, ...])."

   This is documented as **intentional behavior** due to "the inability to statically know the full length of the index."

2. **Documented Behavior**:
   - The method is documented to behave differently from pandas
   - Each partition will restart its index at 0
   - This is a known, documented limitation/design decision

3. **Parameter Documentation**:
   - The `drop=True` parameter is documented to "not try to insert index into dataframe columns"
   - There is no special documentation suggesting `drop=True` would change the partitioned index behavior

4. **General Dask-Pandas Compatibility**:
   - Dask documentation emphasizes similarity with pandas API
   - States "Dask DataFrame copies pandas, and so should be familiar to most users"
   - However, it does NOT guarantee 100% identical behavior in all cases
   - The documentation acknowledges differences due to parallel processing

## Conclusion

The behavior described in the bug report is actually **documented behavior**, not an undocumented bug. The documentation explicitly warns users that `reset_index` will produce different results than pandas, with each partition restarting at 0.
