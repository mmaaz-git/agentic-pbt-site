## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation

The function `sorted_division_locations` is defined in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/io/io.py` (lines 256-278).

The function's docstring explicitly documents that it accepts plain Python lists and provides multiple examples:

1. **Line 262-264**: Shows using a list `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`
2. **Line 266-267**: Shows same list with different chunksize
3. **Line 269-271**: Shows list with duplicates `['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C']`
4. **Line 273-274**: Shows same list with different chunksize
5. **Line 276-277**: Shows single-element list `['A']`

All examples in the docstring use plain Python lists, not numpy arrays or pandas objects.

### Function Signature

```python
def sorted_division_locations(seq, npartitions=None, chunksize=None):
    """Find division locations and values in sorted list"""
```

The parameter name `seq` and docstring description "sorted list" clearly indicate lists should be supported.

### Public vs Internal API

- The function is imported in test files: `dask.dataframe.io.tests.test_io`
- The function is imported in dask_expr: `dask.dataframe.io.io`
- The function is NOT exported in the public API documentation on docs.dask.org
- The function is NOT in `__all__` exports from the io module

This appears to be a semi-internal function that is used within the dask ecosystem but not prominently exposed to end users.

### Test Coverage

Looking at the test file, all tests use pandas Series or other library types, never plain Python lists. This suggests the docstring examples were never actually tested.

### Conclusion

The documentation (docstring) establishes a clear contract that plain Python lists should work. All five examples in the docstring use plain lists. The fact that the implementation doesn't support this represents a clear mismatch between documented behavior and actual behavior.
