BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

I will analyze this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID - Reasons it could be INVALID:
   - None. The bug is real and reproducible.
   - The documentation clearly states the return type should be bytes.
   - sample=0 is a valid integer input according to the documentation.
   - The code violates the documented contract by returning int instead of bytes.
   VERDICT: NOT INVALID

2. WONTFIX - Reasons it could be WONTFIX:
   - One could argue that sample=0 is an obscure edge case.
   - However, it's not that obscure - users might reasonably want to read 0 bytes for testing or edge case handling.
   - The bug causes a type error that breaks downstream code expecting bytes.
   - The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality.
   VERDICT: NOT WONTFIX

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Reasons it could be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - One could argue the documentation should specify that sample=0 returns integer 0.
   - However, this would be inconsistent with sample="0" returning b''.
   - The documentation explicitly states the return type is bytes, not "bytes or int".
   - Changing documentation to allow int return would break the API contract.
   - The more sensible fix is to make the code match the documentation.
   VERDICT: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX

4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Reasons it could be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This is not requesting new functionality.
   - sample=0 is already supposed to be supported according to the docs.
   - This is about fixing existing functionality to match documented behavior.
   VERDICT: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

5. BUG - Reasons this IS a BUG:
   - The function violates its documented return type contract.
   - The behavior is inconsistent: sample="0" returns b'' but sample=0 returns int 0.
   - The bug causes AttributeError when calling bytes methods on the returned value.
   - The root cause is clear: the condition `if sample:` incorrectly treats 0 as False.
   - The fix is straightforward: change to `if sample is not False:`.
   - This is a genuine implementation error that needs correction.
   VERDICT: THIS IS A BUG

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Severity: Medium (causes type errors but has workarounds)
- Impact: Any code that passes sample=0 and expects bytes will fail
- Workaround exists: Use sample="0" instead of sample=0
- Fix complexity: Simple one-line change
- Backwards compatibility: The fix preserves all existing documented behavior
