## Documentation Analysis for _clean_new_division_boundaries

### Function Location and Implementation
The function `_clean_new_division_boundaries` is located in `/dask/dataframe/dask_expr/_repartition.py` (lines 499-506).

### Current Implementation
```python
def _clean_new_division_boundaries(new_partitions_boundaries, frame_npartitions):
    if not isinstance(new_partitions_boundaries, list):
        new_partitions_boundaries = list(new_partitions_boundaries)
    if new_partitions_boundaries[0] > 0:
        new_partitions_boundaries.insert(0, 0)
    if new_partitions_boundaries[-1] < frame_npartitions:
        new_partitions_boundaries[-1] = frame_npartitions
    return new_partitions_boundaries
```

### Function Documentation
**NO DOCUMENTATION FOUND**. The function has:
- No docstring
- No inline comments
- No type hints
- No parameter descriptions
- No return value description
- No specification of expected behavior or invariants

### Usage Context
The function is used internally in two places within the same module:
1. Line 184-186: Called with boundaries generated from integer calculations based on partition ratios
2. Line 451-453: Called with cumulative sum of new partitions as boundaries

### Inferred Purpose
Based on the implementation and usage context, the function appears to:
1. Ensure boundaries is a list (converting from other iterables if needed)
2. Ensure the first boundary starts at 0 (inserting 0 if needed)
3. Ensure the last boundary equals frame_npartitions (replacing the last value if it's less)

### Key Observation
Without explicit documentation, the expected behavior for edge cases is undefined:
- What should happen when boundaries are not sorted?
- What should happen when the last boundary exceeds frame_npartitions?
- Should intermediate boundaries be preserved or can they be modified?
- What are the expected invariants for the output?

The lack of documentation makes it impossible to definitively determine if the current behavior is intentional or a bug. The function name suggests it "cleans" boundaries, but what constitutes "clean" is not specified.
