DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR dask.utils.format_bytes

The function `format_bytes` is documented in the source code at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py, lines 1770-1799.

DOCSTRING CONTENT:
The function has a clear docstring that includes:
1. A brief description: "Format bytes as text"
2. Several usage examples showing conversions from bytes to human-readable format
3. A specific claim at line 1788: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION:
The function iterates through prefixes (Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, ki) with their corresponding powers of 2 (2**50, 2**40, 2**30, 2**20, 2**10). For each prefix, it checks if n >= k * 0.9 (90% of the threshold), and if so, formats the output as "{n/k:.2f} {prefix}B".

KEY DOCUMENTATION CLAIM:
The docstring explicitly states a contract/guarantee: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

This is not stated as a typical behavior or approximation - it's stated as an absolute guarantee ("always") with a specific boundary condition (< 2**60).

NO EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION:
I did not find any external documentation (like official Dask documentation pages) that would override or clarify this claim differently. The help() function shows the same docstring.

INTERPRETATION:
The documentation makes a clear, unambiguous claim about the maximum output length for inputs less than 2**60. This appears to be intended as a guarantee that users can rely on for formatting purposes (e.g., when creating fixed-width output tables).
