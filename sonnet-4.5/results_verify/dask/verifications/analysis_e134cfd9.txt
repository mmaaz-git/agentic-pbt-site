## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This could be considered invalid because `sorted_division_locations` is not a public API function. It's an internal utility function in dask/dataframe/io/io.py that is not documented in Dask's public documentation. Users should not be calling internal functions directly, and the behavior of internal functions is not guaranteed. The function works correctly when called by other Dask internals which always pass numpy/pandas objects.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function has a detailed docstring with multiple examples, and every single example in the docstring uses plain Python lists. If the function truly is internal-only and not meant to handle lists, the docstring should not show list examples. The docstring creates a reasonable expectation that lists should work.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Since this is an internal function not exposed in the public API, fixing it to handle plain lists might be considered unnecessary overhead. The function works correctly for its intended internal use cases where it receives numpy arrays or pandas objects. Adding support for plain lists would add complexity for no practical benefit since internal callers don't pass lists.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial (just add a list dispatch handler or special case), and having correct examples in docstrings is important for code maintainability. Even internal functions should have accurate documentation for developers working on the codebase.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The most appropriate resolution would be to fix the docstring examples to use numpy arrays or pandas Index objects instead of plain lists. This would accurately reflect what the function actually accepts. The function itself works correctly for its intended use - the only problem is that the documentation examples are misleading. All five examples in the docstring should be updated to use `np.array(['A', 'B', ...])` or `pd.Index(['A', 'B', ...])` instead of plain lists.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue that since the comment in the code says "Convert from an ndarray to a plain list", the original intent might have been to accept lists as well. The implementation might be incomplete rather than the documentation being wrong.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting plain Python lists could be seen as a new feature request - adding functionality that was never implemented. The function currently only supports numpy/pandas objects, and adding list support would be extending its capabilities. This would be a reasonable enhancement for consistency with Python conventions.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The docstring examples strongly suggest that list support was intended from the beginning, not a new feature. All examples use lists, indicating this was the original design intent rather than a new capability being requested.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There is a clear contract violation - the function's own documentation shows it should accept lists, but it crashes when given lists. Every single example in the docstring fails when executed. This is a textbook case of implementation not matching specification. The function fails on the exact inputs shown in its own examples.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an internal function not part of the public API. Internal functions don't have the same contract guarantees as public APIs. The examples might have been written carelessly or might be outdated from an earlier version. Since no public API is affected and internal callers work correctly, this might not qualify as a true bug.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this issue presents a classic documentation-implementation mismatch for an internal utility function. The key factors to consider are:

First, `sorted_division_locations` is clearly an internal function - it's not documented in Dask's public API, not exported in __all__, and primarily used by other internal Dask functions. Internal functions generally don't have the same contract obligations as public APIs. Users who call internal functions do so at their own risk, and behavior changes or limitations are expected.

Second, however, the function does have a detailed docstring with five examples, and remarkably, ALL five examples use plain Python lists as input. This creates a strong expectation that lists should work, even for developers reading the internal code. The inconsistency between the docstring and implementation is problematic for code maintainability and could mislead developers working on Dask itself.

Third, the practical impact is minimal. The function works correctly for all its actual use cases within Dask, where it receives numpy arrays or pandas objects from calling functions. No user-facing functionality is broken. The only scenario where this causes problems is if someone reads the source code and tries to use this internal function directly with lists, which they shouldn't be doing anyway. Given these factors, this is fundamentally a documentation accuracy issue rather than a functional bug. The most appropriate resolution is to update the docstring examples to accurately reflect what the function accepts.
