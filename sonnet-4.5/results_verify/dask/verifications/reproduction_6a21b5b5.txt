REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR TYPE MISMATCH BUG IN DASK.DIAGNOSTICS.PROFILE._TRACKER

1. Bug Location Confirmed:
- File: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/diagnostics/profile.py
- Line 261: `pid = current_process()` assigns a Process object to pid
- Line 252: `p.pid != pid` compares an integer with a Process object
- Line 271: The Process object is passed to _update_pids()

2. Type Mismatch Verification:
Running the reproduction code confirms:
- current_process() returns a multiprocessing.process._MainProcess object
- current_process().pid returns an integer
- Comparing integer != Process object always evaluates to True (they are never equal)

3. Test Results:

a) Simple Test Output:
```
Current process PID: 175591
Type of pid_wrong: <class 'multiprocessing.process._MainProcess'>
Type of pid_correct: <class 'int'>

Buggy version (Process object): 2 processes
  - Parent included: Yes
  - Tracker process included: Yes (BUG - should be excluded)

Correct version (integer pid): 1 processes
  - Parent included: Yes
  - Tracker process included: No (correctly excluded)

Bug confirmed: True
```

b) Direct Comparison Test:
```
Buggy: 12345 != <_MainProcess name='MainProcess' parent=None started>
Result: True
Type: int != Process always evaluates to True

Correct: 12345 != 177490
Result: True
Type: int != int correctly compares PIDs
```

4. Behavioral Impact:
The type mismatch causes the filter condition `p.pid != pid` to ALWAYS evaluate to True because:
- p.pid is an integer (the child process's PID)
- pid is a Process object (not an integer)
- In Python, comparing different types like int != Process always returns True

This means the tracker process is never filtered out and is included in the list of processes to monitor, which is not the intended behavior based on the code structure.

5. Fix Validation:
Changing line 261 from:
```python
pid = current_process()
```
to:
```python
pid = current_process().pid
```
Would correctly compare integer PIDs and properly filter out the tracker process from monitoring itself.
