REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and occurs exactly as described.

## Test Results

1. **Basic Reproduction**: The provided test case with n = 2**60 - 1 fails:
   - Input: 1152921504606846975 (which is 2**60 - 1)
   - Output: '1024.00 PiB'
   - Length: 11 characters
   - Expected: <= 10 characters
   - Result: CONSTRAINT VIOLATED

2. **Hypothesis Property Test**: The property-based test using Hypothesis confirms the bug:
   - The test fails when values approach 2**60
   - First violation occurs at values >= 1000 * 2**50

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Values from 0 to 999.99 * 2**50 produce outputs of 10 characters or less
   - Values >= 1000 * 2**50 produce outputs of 11 characters
   - The transition happens exactly at 1000 * 2**50 where the output becomes '1000.00 PiB' (11 chars)
   - All values from 1000 * 2**50 to 2**60 - 1 violate the constraint

## Root Cause

The issue occurs because:
1. The function formats numbers >= 2**50 * 0.9 as PiB with 2 decimal places
2. When n / 2**50 >= 1000, the formatted number has 4 digits before the decimal point
3. The format "XXXX.XX PiB" requires 11 characters (7 for number, 1 space, 3 for "PiB")
4. The docstring constraint of "<=10 characters for all values < 2**60" is therefore violated

## Impact

The bug affects approximately 2.3% of the valid input range:
- Valid range claimed: 0 to 2**60 - 1
- Affected range: 1000 * 2**50 to 2**60 - 1
- This is approximately 27 * 10^15 values out of 1.15 * 10^18 total values

The bug is consistently reproducible and the report accurately describes both the problem and its cause.
