REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the hypothesis-based test and the simple reproduction example confirm the issue.

1. Hypothesis Test Results:
   - The hypothesis test FAILS with an AssertionError
   - Error message: "Attribute 'dtype' are different"
   - Left (result): StringDtype(storage=pyarrow, na_value=<NA>)
   - Right (original): object
   - The test fails for any pandas DataFrame with string columns

2. Simple Reproduction Example:
   - Input DataFrame has column 'c' with dtype: object
   - After dd.from_pandas(pdf, npartitions=2).compute()
   - Output DataFrame has column 'c' with dtype: string (pyarrow-backed)
   - The assertion `pdf['c'].dtype == result['c'].dtype` fails

3. Additional Finding:
   - The conversion behavior is controlled by the dask config setting "dataframe.convert-string"
   - This config defaults to None, which is treated as True
   - When set to False, the round-trip preserves the original object dtype
   - With config set to False: from_pandas(pdf).compute() preserves object dtype

The bug is real and reproducible. The function silently converts object-dtype string columns to pyarrow-backed string dtype, breaking the round-trip property that users would reasonably expect.
