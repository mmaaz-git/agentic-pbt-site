BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT

Test Case from Bug Report:
- Input: divisions=(Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2000-01-01 01:00:00')),
         rule='D', closed='left', label='left'
- Expected: outdivs should be monotonically increasing
- Actual Result: outdivs = (Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00'))
- Result: DUPLICATE VALUES - NOT monotonically increasing

Bug Confirmed: YES

Detailed Analysis:
1. The function returns outdivs with two identical timestamps
2. outdivs[0] == outdivs[1] == Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00')
3. This violates the monotonic increasing requirement (should be strictly <, not <=)

Root Cause Analysis:
The bug occurs in the adjustment logic (lines 92-101):
1. When len(newdivs) < len(divs), a setter using append is created
2. For outdivs, when outdivs[-1] < divisions[-1], the code appends temp.index[-1]
3. In this case, temp has only one element, so temp.index[-1] equals outdivs[-1]
4. This causes the same value to be appended, creating a duplicate

Hypothesis Test Results:
- Ran property-based testing with 100 examples
- Found multiple failures with the same pattern
- All failures show duplicate timestamps in outdivs
- Pattern consistent: happens when resampling from fine to coarse granularity

Additional Test Cases Found:
- Any case where input has 2 hourly timestamps being resampled to daily
- Similar issues with other frequency combinations (e.g., minutes to hours)

Impact Assessment:
- This bug affects core Dask functionality for time series resampling
- Violates fundamental Dask invariant that divisions must be strictly increasing
- Could cause downstream errors in partition-based operations
- Could lead to incorrect data selection/filtering based on time ranges

Verification:
The bug is 100% reproducible with the provided test case and occurs consistently across similar input patterns.
