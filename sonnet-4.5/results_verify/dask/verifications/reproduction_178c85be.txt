## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Summary
The bug report claims that `dask.widgets.widgets.key_split` (actually `dask.utils.key_split`) crashes with a `UnicodeDecodeError` when given bytes that are not valid UTF-8, despite the function's docstring showing it accepts bytes input and having a general exception handler.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Valid UTF-8 bytes test**:
   - `key_split(b'hello-world-1')` returns `'hello-world'` ✓
   - This works as documented in the docstring

2. **Invalid UTF-8 bytes test**:
   - `key_split(b'\x80')` raises `UnicodeDecodeError` ✗
   - Error: "'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte"
   - The function crashes instead of handling the error gracefully

3. **Hypothesis property test**:
   - Failed on random binary data
   - First failure example: `b'%\xbc\x9a%\xa4\n'`
   - Error: "'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xbc in position 1: invalid start byte"

4. **None input test**:
   - `key_split(None)` returns `'Other'` ✓
   - This demonstrates the function is designed to handle edge cases

5. **Various invalid UTF-8 sequences**:
   - All tested sequences raised `UnicodeDecodeError`:
     - `b'\x80'` (Invalid start byte)
     - `b'\xff'` (Invalid byte)
     - `b'\xc0\x80'` (Overlong encoding)
     - `b'\xed\xa0\x80'` (UTF-16 surrogate half)
     - `b'\xc2'` (Incomplete sequence)

### Code Analysis

Looking at the implementation in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py`:

```python
def key_split(s):
    # If we convert the key, recurse to utilize LRU cache better
    if type(s) is bytes:
        return key_split(s.decode())  # Line 1979 - crashes here on invalid UTF-8
    if type(s) is tuple:
        return key_split(s[0])
    try:
        # ... main processing logic ...
    except Exception:
        return "Other"  # Line 2002 - exception handler that should catch errors
```

The problem is that the `s.decode()` call on line 1979 happens **before** the try-except block that starts at line 1982. When `s.decode()` is called on invalid UTF-8 bytes, it raises a `UnicodeDecodeError` that is not caught.

### Conclusion
The bug report is correct. The function crashes on invalid UTF-8 bytes despite having documentation that shows it accepts bytes input and having an exception handler that returns "Other" for errors. The issue is a structural problem where the bytes-to-string conversion happens outside the exception handling block.
