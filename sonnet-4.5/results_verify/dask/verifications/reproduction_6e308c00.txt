Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug report and confirmed the issue. Here are my findings:

1. TEST EXECUTION:
   - The Hypothesis property-based test runs successfully and passes
   - The test confirms that the function enforces a MINIMUM chunk size
   - All generated test cases validate that output chunks are >= the specified size parameter

2. DOCSTRING CONTRADICTION:
   The function docstring contains a clear contradiction:

   - Function name: "ensure_minimum_chunksize" (clearly indicates minimum)
   - Docstring summary: "Determine new chunks to ensure that every chunk >= size" (describes minimum)
   - Parameter documentation: "size: int - The maximum size of any chunk" (incorrectly states maximum)

3. IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS:
   Looking at the source code (line 341):
   ```python
   if size <= min(chunks):
       return chunks
   ```
   This line confirms that if the size parameter is already less than or equal to the minimum chunk, no changes are needed. This is consistent with enforcing a MINIMUM chunk size.

4. TEST RESULTS:
   - ensure_minimum_chunksize(10, (20, 20, 1)) = (20, 11, 10)
     All output chunks are >= 10 (the minimum)

   - ensure_minimum_chunksize(5, (1, 2, 3)) = (6,)
     Combines small chunks to ensure result >= 5

   - ensure_minimum_chunksize(10, (5, 5, 5)) = (15,)
     Combines all chunks since none meet the minimum of 10

   - ensure_minimum_chunksize(3, (10, 10, 10)) = (10, 10, 10)
     No changes needed since all chunks already >= 3

5. DOCSTRING EXAMPLES:
   The examples in the docstring also confirm minimum enforcement:
   >>> ensure_minimum_chunksize(10, (20, 20, 1))
   (20, 11, 10)

   The last chunk (1) is increased to 10, and the middle chunk adjusted to 11, ensuring all chunks are >= 10.

CONCLUSION:
The bug report is accurate. There is a documentation error where the parameter description states "The maximum size of any chunk" when it should state "The minimum size of any chunk". The function name, docstring summary, implementation, and examples all consistently indicate that this function enforces a MINIMUM chunk size, not a maximum.
