## Documentation Analysis for dask.utils.format_bytes

I have reviewed the documentation for the `dask.utils.format_bytes` function from multiple sources:

1. **Function Docstring (in source code)**: The docstring clearly states:
   - "Format bytes as text"
   - Provides several usage examples
   - Explicitly claims: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

2. **Source Code Implementation**: The function uses binary prefixes (powers of 2) with the following units:
   - PiB (2**50)
   - TiB (2**40)
   - GiB (2**30)
   - MiB (2**20)
   - kiB (2**10)
   - B (bytes)

3. **Key Documentation Claim**: The documentation makes a specific contract with users: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters." This is a clear, testable promise about the function's behavior.

4. **Online Documentation**: The web documentation and various resources confirm that this is a utility function for formatting byte values into human-readable strings, commonly used throughout Dask for displaying memory and size information.

The bug report specifically challenges the documented claim about the 10-character limit for values less than 2**60. This is not an ambiguous or implicit expectation - it is an explicitly documented guarantee in the function's docstring.

The documentation does not specify what should happen for values >= 2**60, nor does it indicate whether this 10-character limit is critical for any specific functionality. However, the fact that it is explicitly stated suggests it may be relied upon by users or other parts of the codebase for formatting purposes (e.g., fixed-width displays, logging formats, etc.).
