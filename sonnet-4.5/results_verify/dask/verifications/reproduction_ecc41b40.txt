## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in dask.diagnostics.CacheProfiler.__init__.

### Test Results

1. **Direct Test with Empty String**:
   - When passing `metric_name=""` to CacheProfiler, the expected behavior (according to the bug report) is that `prof._metric_name` should be set to the empty string.
   - Actual behavior: `prof._metric_name` is set to `'custom_metric'` (the function name of the metric)
   - Result: FAILS as described in the bug report

2. **Comparison Tests**:
   - `metric_name=""` -> `_metric_name='custom_metric'` (FAILS - uses function name instead)
   - `metric_name="test"` -> `_metric_name='test'` (PASSES - works correctly)
   - `metric_name="   "` -> `_metric_name='   '` (PASSES - whitespace string is preserved)

### Root Cause Verification

I examined the source code in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/diagnostics/profile.py` at lines 350-358:

```python
def __init__(self, metric=None, metric_name=None):
    self.clear()
    self._metric = metric if metric else lambda value: 1
    if metric_name:  # Line 353 - This is the problematic line
        self._metric_name = metric_name
    elif metric:
        self._metric_name = metric.__name__
    else:
        self._metric_name = "count"
```

The issue is on line 353 where `if metric_name:` uses a truthiness check. In Python, an empty string `""` evaluates to `False`, so when `metric_name=""` is passed:
1. The condition `if metric_name:` evaluates to False
2. Control flows to `elif metric:` which evaluates to True (since a custom_metric was provided)
3. `self._metric_name` gets set to `metric.__name__` which is `'custom_metric'`

### Behavior Inconsistency

The bug report correctly identifies an inconsistency:
- Empty string `""` is treated as falsy and ignored
- Whitespace-only strings like `"   "` are treated as truthy and preserved
- This creates surprising behavior where explicitly passing an empty string is ignored

The proposed fix of changing `if metric_name:` to `if metric_name is not None:` would correctly distinguish between:
- Not providing the parameter (None)
- Explicitly providing an empty string ("")

### Effect of the Bug

This bug causes unexpected behavior when a user explicitly wants to set an empty metric name. While this might seem like an edge case, it violates the principle of least surprise - an explicitly provided value (even if empty) should be respected rather than silently replaced with a default.
