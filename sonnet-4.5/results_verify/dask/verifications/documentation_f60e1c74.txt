DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR dask.dataframe.DataFrame.repartition

## Official Documentation Review

I examined the official Dask documentation for the `repartition` method. The key findings are:

1. **Method Purpose**: The repartition method is designed to reorganize a Dask DataFrame into a different number of partitions.

2. **Key Parameter - npartitions**: The documentation explicitly states:
   - "Approximate number of partitions of output. The number of partitions used may be slightly lower than npartitions depending on data distribution, but will never be higher."
   - This is important - it clearly says the actual number of partitions may be LOWER than requested, but never HIGHER.

3. **No Mention of AssertionError**: The documentation does not mention that AssertionError can be raised. It only mentions ValueError for cases where multiple partitioning parameters are specified incorrectly.

4. **No Special Case for Small Data**: The documentation does not specify any special behavior or limitations when dealing with very small DataFrames (e.g., single row) or when trying to increase partitions from 1 to more.

5. **Divisions Behavior**: The documentation mentions divisions but does not specifically address what happens when divisions are unknown (created with sort=False) and how this affects repartitioning behavior.

6. **Error Handling**: The documentation only mentions ValueError for incorrect parameter specification. It does not document any AssertionError or any errors related to insufficient data for repartitioning.

## Key Observation

The documentation suggests that when requesting more partitions than can be created from the available data, the system should either:
1. Create fewer partitions than requested (as stated: "may be slightly lower than npartitions")
2. Raise a clear, documented error (like ValueError)

The documentation does NOT indicate that an AssertionError is expected behavior in any scenario.
