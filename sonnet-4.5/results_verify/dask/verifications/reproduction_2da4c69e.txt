=== Bug Reproduction Report ===

I successfully reproduced the reported bug in dask.dataframe.utils._maybe_sort.

Test Results:
1. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - Created a DataFrame with column 'A' containing [2, 1] and index named 'A' with values [10, 20]
   - Before calling _maybe_sort: index.names = ['A']
   - After calling _maybe_sort: index.names = ['-overlapped-index-name-0']
   - Bug confirmed: The index name was permanently changed from 'A' to '-overlapped-index-name-0'

2. Property-Based Test:
   - The Hypothesis test failed as expected with the error: "Index name changed from A to -overlapped-index-name-0"
   - This confirms the bug occurs for any DataFrame where index.name equals a column name

Source Code Analysis:
I examined the actual source code at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/utils.py, lines 495-510.
The function does indeed:
1. Check if index names overlap with column names (line 501)
2. Rename the index names to avoid conflicts (lines 502-504)
3. Sort the dataframe by columns (line 505)
4. Return the result with the renamed index names still in place (line 510)

The bug is real - the function modifies index names when they overlap with column names and never restores them, causing a permanent mutation that is visible to the caller.
