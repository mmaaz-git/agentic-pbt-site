BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS

Considering each possible categorization:

1. INVALID:
Arguments against INVALID:
- The docstring explicitly states "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters"
- This is not an ambiguous statement or undocumented behavior
- The test correctly identifies values < 2**60 that produce > 10 character outputs
- The implementation clearly violates the documented contract

Arguments for INVALID:
- None. The bug report correctly identifies a real discrepancy between documentation and implementation.

2. WONTFIX:
Arguments against WONTFIX:
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects all values >= 1000 PiB
- The 10-character guarantee may be important for users who rely on fixed-width formatting
- The issue is easily fixable (as shown in the proposed fix)
- Values around 1000 PiB, while large, are not unrealistic in modern computing contexts (e.g., large-scale distributed systems, data centers)

Arguments for WONTFIX:
- Values >= 1000 PiB are extremely large (exabyte scale)
- In practice, most users may never encounter these values
- The output is still readable and functional, just 1 character longer than promised

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The simplest fix would be to update the documentation to say "usually <= 10 characters" or "<=11 characters"
- The current behavior (11 characters for large values) might be acceptable
- Changing documentation is less risky than changing code behavior

Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- Users may already depend on the 10-character guarantee for formatting
- The fix to maintain 10 characters is straightforward
- The documentation made a specific promise that should be honored

4. FEATURE_REQUEST:
Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The docstring already promises this behavior
- It's fixing a bug, not adding a feature

Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- None. This is clearly about fixing existing broken behavior, not adding new capabilities.

5. BUG:
Arguments for BUG:
- There's a clear, documented contract: output <= 10 characters for values < 2**60
- The implementation violates this contract for specific inputs
- The bug is reproducible and well-defined
- The issue affects the function's stated guarantee, which users may rely upon
- The proposed fix is reasonable and maintains the documented behavior

Arguments against BUG:
- Could argue it should be DOCUMENTATION_FIX instead if we decide the 11-character output is acceptable

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a BUG. The function has a clearly documented contract that it violates. While the affected values are large, the documentation makes an explicit promise without caveats. The fact that a user noticed and reported this shows that the guarantee matters to at least some users. The implementation should match its documentation, especially when the fix is straightforward.
