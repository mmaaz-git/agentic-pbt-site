## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` is an internal implementation detail (starts with underscore) and has no public documentation specifying that the two returned tuples must have the same length. The lack of explicit documentation about this requirement could mean the behavior is intentional and handled elsewhere in the codebase. Additionally, the function could be designed to return different length tuples for certain edge cases as part of its internal logic.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function is clearly used in a way that expects the two tuples to have compatible lengths. The `ResampleAggregation._lower()` method creates BlockwiseDep objects from slices of these tuples (lines 162-164), and the `_divisions()` method combines them expecting a consistent structure. The fact that the mismatch only occurs with specific parameter combinations (closed='right', label='right') suggests this is an unintended edge case rather than deliberate design.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal function that users don't directly call, and the specific combination of closed='right' and label='right' might be rarely used in practice. The issue only manifests under specific conditions and may not affect most users. The complexity of fixing this edge case might outweigh the benefits if there are workarounds or if users can use different parameter combinations.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug affects a legitimate use case (closed='right' and label='right' are valid pandas resample parameters) and causes incorrect behavior in the resampling functionality. The issue is in core time series functionality that users rely on for data analysis. The fact that it creates inconsistent partition boundaries could lead to subtle data processing errors.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function lacks documentation about the expected relationship between the two returned tuples. Adding documentation to clarify that certain parameter combinations may return mismatched lengths could be sufficient if this is intended behavior. The documentation could warn users about this edge case when using specific parameter combinations.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code's usage pattern clearly shows that the two tuples are meant to work together as division boundaries, and having different lengths breaks this assumption. The issue is not about missing documentation but about actual incorrect behavior in the code logic. The downstream code expects these tuples to have a specific relationship that is violated.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting the closed='right' and label='right' combination properly could be seen as adding support for a parameter combination that wasn't fully implemented. The current code might not have been designed to handle all possible parameter combinations, and adding this support would be an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The parameters closed='right' and label='right' are already accepted by the function and are standard pandas resample parameters. This isn't asking for new functionality but fixing existing functionality that doesn't work correctly. The function already attempts to handle these parameters but does so incorrectly.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function returns inconsistent results for valid input parameters. The two returned tuples are used together as partition boundaries, and having different lengths violates this implicit contract. The bug is deterministic, reproducible, and occurs with legitimate parameter combinations. The root cause is clearly identified in the conditional logic where `newdivs` is always modified but `outdivs` is only conditionally modified.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function is internal (underscore-prefixed) and might have undocumented design decisions that make this behavior intentional. Without explicit documentation stating the tuples must have the same length, this could be considered undefined behavior rather than a bug. The issue might be handled elsewhere in the codebase in ways not immediately apparent.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate bug in the Dask codebase. The evidence strongly supports this classification:

First, the function `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` returns two tuples that are explicitly used together as division boundaries in the resampling process. The `ResampleAggregation` class depends on these tuples having a consistent structure - it creates BlockwiseDep objects from corresponding slices and combines them in the `_divisions()` method. When the lengths don't match, this creates inconsistent partition boundaries that could lead to incorrect data processing.

Second, the bug is highly specific and deterministic - it only occurs with the parameter combination of closed='right' and label='right', while all other combinations work correctly. This pattern strongly suggests an edge case bug rather than intentional design. The root cause is clearly identified in the conditional logic where the code appends to `newdivs` unconditionally but only appends to `outdivs` based on certain conditions, creating the mismatch.

Third, the parameters that trigger the bug (closed='right' and label='right') are valid, documented pandas resample parameters that users would legitimately want to use. This isn't an obscure edge case with nonsensical inputs but a real use case in time series analysis. The fact that pandas handles these parameters correctly while Dask's implementation fails indicates this is indeed a bug that should be fixed to maintain compatibility and correctness.
