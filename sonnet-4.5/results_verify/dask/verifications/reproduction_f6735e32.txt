REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The function `_normalize_and_strip_protocol` in dask.dataframe.io.parquet indeed returns empty strings when given certain inputs.

Test Results:
-------------
1. Ran the specific test cases from the bug report:
   - Input: "/" -> Result: [""]  ✓ Confirmed
   - Input: "///" -> Result: [""]  ✓ Confirmed
   - Input: "file:///" -> Result: [""]  ✓ Confirmed
   - Input: "s3:///" -> Result: [""]  ✓ Confirmed

2. Ran the property-based test with Hypothesis:
   - All four example cases failed as expected
   - Empty strings were found in the results

Code Analysis:
--------------
The issue occurs at line 1834 of parquet.py:
```python
result.append(p.rstrip("/"))
```

When the input path is only slashes (e.g., "/") or a protocol followed by only slashes (e.g., "file:///"), the rstrip("/") operation removes all trailing slashes, leaving an empty string.

Impact Verification:
-------------------
I tested how pyarrow handles empty strings:
- pyarrow.fs.FileSelector("") raises: "[Errno 2] Cannot list directory ''. Detail: [errno 2] No such file or directory"
- This confirms that empty strings cause errors downstream when passed to pyarrow operations

The bug is genuine and causes real issues in the data processing pipeline.
