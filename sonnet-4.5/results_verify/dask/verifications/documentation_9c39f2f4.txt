## Documentation Analysis for dask.bag.Bag.var

### Dask Documentation
The dask.bag.Bag.var() method has minimal documentation. The docstring only says "Variance" and the method signature shows it accepts a `ddof` parameter with default value 0. There is no specific documentation about:
- How edge cases are handled
- What happens when ddof equals or exceeds the number of elements
- How empty bags are handled
- What error messages or return values to expect in edge cases

### NumPy Documentation (Reference Implementation)
NumPy's var() documentation states:
- The ddof parameter means "Delta Degrees of Freedom" where the divisor is `N - ddof`
- NumPy returns `inf` when ddof=2 and n=2 (division by zero), with a RuntimeWarning
- NumPy returns `nan` for empty arrays
- NumPy issues RuntimeWarnings for "Degrees of freedom <= 0" and "divide by zero"

### Pandas Behavior (Another Reference)
Pandas Series.var():
- Returns `nan` when ddof >= n (including when ddof=2 and n=2)
- Returns `nan` for empty series
- Does not raise exceptions but returns nan for invalid cases

### Statistical Context
The variance formula uses `N - ddof` in the denominator. When this becomes zero or negative:
- Mathematically, the variance is undefined (division by zero)
- Statistically, having ddof >= N doesn't make sense (you can't have more degrees of freedom used than data points)

### Key Finding
The Dask documentation does not specify what should happen when ddof >= n or with empty bags. This is an undocumented edge case. Both NumPy and Pandas handle this gracefully by returning special values (inf or nan) with warnings, rather than crashing with ZeroDivisionError.
