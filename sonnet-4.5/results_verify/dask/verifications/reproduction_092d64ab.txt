## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report is accurate. The `read_block` function in `fsspec.utils` (which is imported and re-exported by `dask.bytes.core`) raises an `AssertionError` when called with `length=None` and `delimiter=None`.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Executed the property-based test from the bug report using Hypothesis
2. Executed the simple reproduction case
3. Verified that `length=None` works when a delimiter is provided
4. Verified that normal usage with a numeric length works correctly

### Results
1. **Hypothesis test**: Failed as expected with AssertionError on the assertion `assert length is not None`
2. **Simple reproduction**: Raised AssertionError as described in the bug report when calling `read_block(f, 0, None, delimiter=None)`
3. **With delimiter**: Successfully returns the entire file content when `length=None` and `delimiter=b'\n'` are provided
4. **Normal usage**: Works correctly with numeric length values

### Key Findings
- The function is actually from `fsspec.utils`, not native to dask, but is re-exported by `dask.bytes.core`
- The docstring explicitly states: "length: int - Number of bytes to read, read through end of file if None"
- The code has a TODO comment acknowledging this issue: "# TODO: allow length to be None and read to the end of the file?"
- The assertion `assert length is not None` on line 303 prevents the documented behavior
- When a delimiter is provided, the code path bypasses this assertion (line 280-281 returns early)
- This creates an inconsistent API where `length=None` works with delimiter but not without

### Conclusion
The bug report accurately identifies a contract violation where the implementation doesn't match the documented API. Users who follow the documentation will encounter an unexpected AssertionError when using `length=None` without a delimiter.
