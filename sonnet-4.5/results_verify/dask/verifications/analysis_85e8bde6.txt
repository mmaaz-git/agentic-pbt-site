BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The docstring makes an explicit, testable guarantee: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters"
   - The implementation violates this guarantee for values >= 1000 * 2**50
   - The bug is reproducible and affects a range of valid inputs
   - Users may rely on this guarantee for UI layout, column formatting, or buffer allocation
   - The documentation uses the word "always" - a strong, unqualified promise

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The affected values are extremely large (near 2**60) and might be rare in practice
   - The overflow is minimal (just 1 character)

2. INVALID
   Arguments FOR:
   - None. The documentation explicitly promises something the code doesn't deliver.

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is clearly a valid issue where the code doesn't match its documented behavior

3. WONTFIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - The affected values are extremely large (>= 1000 PiB) and rarely encountered
   - The difference is only 1 character
   - Fixing might require changing the formatting precision, affecting output appearance

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation makes an explicit guarantee that should be honored
   - Some users may depend on the 10-character limit for formatting purposes
   - The bug affects a defined range of valid inputs (not undefined behavior)

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - The code works correctly in formatting bytes, just not within the stated constraint
   - Easier to update documentation than change formatting logic
   - The current formatting (with 2 decimal places) is reasonable and useful
   - Changing the code might break existing users who expect the current format

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The 10-character limit appears to be an intentional design constraint
   - Users may already depend on this documented guarantee
   - The documentation fix would weaken a useful guarantee

5. FEATURE_REQUEST
   Arguments FOR:
   - None. The documentation already promises this behavior.

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is not a request for new functionality but a violation of existing documented behavior

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
-----------------
This is clearly either a BUG or DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The deciding factor is:

- If the 10-character limit was an intentional design constraint that users depend on → BUG
- If the documentation was overly optimistic and the current formatting is preferred → DOCUMENTATION_FIX

Given that:
1. The documentation uses strong, unqualified language ("always")
2. The 10-character limit appears intentional (likely for display formatting)
3. The bug report provides a reasonable fix to maintain the constraint
4. This is a testable contract that the library promises to users

This should be categorized as BUG.
