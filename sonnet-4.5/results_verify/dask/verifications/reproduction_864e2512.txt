REPRODUCTION REPORT FOR DASK RESET_INDEX BUG
==============================================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

## Bug Confirmation
The bug is REAL and reproducible. When reset_index(drop=True) is called on a Dask DataFrame with multiple partitions, each partition independently resets its index starting from 0, resulting in duplicate index values.

## Test Results

### Property-Based Test
- The provided Hypothesis test FAILS as expected
- The test correctly identifies that Dask produces different index values than pandas

### Simple Reproduction
With data=[(0, 0.0), (0, 0.0)] and npartitions=2:
- Pandas produces index: [0, 1] (correct sequential index)
- Dask produces index: [0, 0] (duplicate values - BUG)

### Extended Testing
I tested various scenarios to understand the bug's scope:

1. Single partition (npartitions=1):
   - Works correctly, produces [0, 1]
   - Bug only appears with multiple partitions

2. Two partitions (npartitions=2):
   - Produces [0, 0] instead of [0, 1]
   - Each partition resets independently

3. Larger dataset with 3 partitions (6 rows):
   - Pandas: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Dask: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - Pattern shows each partition restarts at 0

4. reset_index with drop=False:
   - Also affected - produces [0, 0] instead of [0, 1]
   - The old index values are correctly preserved in a column
   - But the new index still has duplicates

## Root Cause
The bug occurs because each Dask partition independently calls pandas' reset_index() on its local data, without coordination to ensure globally unique index values. When there are N partitions, each starts its index from 0, leading to duplicate values across partition boundaries.

## Impact
This is a significant bug because:
1. It violates the fundamental assumption that DataFrame indices are unique
2. It makes the Dask behavior inconsistent with pandas
3. It could lead to incorrect results in downstream operations that rely on unique indices
4. The bug affects both drop=True and drop=False cases
