## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `_aggregate_files` method itself has no docstring and is marked as a classmethod. It appears to be an internal helper method (prefixed with underscore) for the ArrowORCEngine class.

### Parameter Documentation from read_orc
From the public API documentation of `read_orc`, we can understand the expected behavior:

1. **split_stripes** (int or False):
   - "Maximum number of ORC stripes to include in each output-DataFrame partition"
   - "Use False to specify a 1-to-1 mapping between files and partitions"
   - Default is 1

2. **aggregate_files** (bool, default False):
   - "Whether distinct file paths may be aggregated into the same output partition"
   - "True means that any two file paths may be aggregated into the same output partition"
   - "False means that inter-file aggregation is prohibited"

### Expected Behavior Analysis
Based on the documentation:
1. When `split_stripes=False`, there should be a 1-to-1 mapping between files and partitions
2. When `aggregate_files=True`, files can be combined into the same partition
3. The combination of `split_stripes=False` and `aggregate_files=True` is a valid configuration according to the documentation

### Documentation Gap
The documentation does not specify:
- That `split_stripes=False` and `aggregate_files=True` with a numeric `split_stripes` value in `_aggregate_files` are incompatible
- That stripe values might be None in certain configurations
- Any restrictions on combining these parameters

### Code vs Documentation Mismatch
The code shows that when `split_stripes=False` in `read_metadata`, it creates parts with `None` stripe values (line 63). However, `_aggregate_files` assumes stripe values are always lists when both `aggregate_files=True` and `split_stripes > 1`.

This is a clear implementation bug where the code doesn't handle all valid parameter combinations that the documentation suggests should work.
