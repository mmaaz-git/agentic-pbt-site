BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

Bug Report Summary:
The bug report claims that `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` produces non-monotonic output divisions when `label='right'` is combined with certain division patterns, specifically with weekly resampling rules.

Reproduction Results:

1. SPECIFIC EXAMPLE FROM BUG REPORT - CONFIRMED:
   Input: divisions=(2001-02-04 00:00:00, 2001-02-04 01:00:00), rule='1W', closed='right', label='right'
   Output: outdivs=(2001-02-04 00:00:00, 2001-01-28 00:00:00)
   Result: NON-MONOTONIC (2001-02-04 > 2001-01-28)

2. ADDITIONAL TEST CASES PERFORMED:
   - Same divisions with closed='right', label='right', rule='2W': NON-MONOTONIC
   - Same divisions with closed='left', label='right', rule='1W': MONOTONIC
   - Same divisions with closed='right', label='left', rule='1W': MONOTONIC
   - Same divisions with closed='left', label='left', rule='1W': MONOTONIC

3. PATTERN IDENTIFIED:
   The bug occurs specifically when ALL of the following conditions are met:
   - closed='right'
   - label='right'
   - rule is a weekly frequency ('1W', '2W', etc.)
   - The division span is shorter than the resampling rule

4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   Through step-by-step debugging, the issue was traced to lines 98-101 in the original code:

   When label='right', the code shifts outdivs by the rule amount (line 82):
       outdivs = tempdivs + rule

   However, when the end adjustment is needed (lines 98-101), the code appends:
       setter(outdivs, temp.index[-1])

   This appends the UNSHIFTED value from temp.index[-1], creating a non-monotonic sequence.
   For the test case: [2001-02-04, 2001-01-28] instead of [2001-02-04, 2001-02-04]

5. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   The provided Hypothesis-based property test is valid and would catch this bug with sufficient examples.
   The bug is deterministic and reproducible with the specific inputs provided.

6. IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
   - The bug produces divisions where outdivs[i] > outdivs[i+1]
   - This violates dask's fundamental requirement that divisions be monotonically increasing
   - This would cause incorrect data partitioning and potentially corrupt results in downstream operations
   - The bug is NOT an edge case - it affects a valid combination of parameters

CONCLUSION:
The bug report is technically accurate. The function does produce non-monotonic output divisions under the specified conditions, which violates dask's architectural requirements.
