DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR sorted_columns FUNCTION
====================================================

1. FUNCTION PURPOSE (from source code docstring):
   - "Find sorted columns given row-group statistics"
   - "This finds all columns that are sorted, along with the appropriate divisions for those columns"
   - Returns: "List of {'name': str, 'divisions': List[str]} dictionaries"

2. DOCUMENTATION SEARCH RESULTS:
   - No specific documentation found in Dask's main docs about sorted_columns function
   - Dask parquet documentation mentions: "Using calculate_divisions=True will not produce known divisions if any of the necessary row-group statistics are missing"
   - The function is internal/utility function not exposed in public API documentation

3. INFERRED BEHAVIOR FROM CODE:
   The function examines parquet row-group statistics to determine which columns are sorted across row groups. It:
   - Takes statistics (list of dicts with column min/max values)
   - Identifies columns where values are monotonically increasing across row groups
   - Returns divisions (boundary values) for sorted columns

4. HANDLING OF NONE VALUES:
   - The documentation does not explicitly specify how None values should be handled
   - The code has multiple checks for None:
     * Line 421-424: Checks if 'min' and 'max' keys exist (not if values are None)
     * Line 427: Sets success = False if first min is None
     * Line 430-432: Sets success = False if subsequent mins are None
     * No check for max being None before using it

5. PARQUET STATISTICS CONTEXT:
   In Parquet files:
   - Statistics (min/max) can be None when:
     * Statistics weren't collected during write
     * Column contains only NULL values
     * Data type doesn't support statistics
   - None statistics mean boundaries are unknown/unusable

6. KEY FINDING:
   The documentation does not explicitly state that None values in max statistics will cause a TypeError. The function appears to assume that if statistics exist (keys present), they will have valid (non-None) values that can be compared and sorted.
