REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in dask.diagnostics.profile_visualize.unquote.

## Bug Confirmation
The function crashes with an IndexError when given an empty dict task (dict, []).

## Reproduction Steps
1. Imported the unquote function from dask.diagnostics.profile_visualize
2. Created the test case: task = (dict, [])
3. Called unquote(task)

## Result
The function crashes with:
IndexError: list index out of range

The error occurs at line 33 in profile_visualize.py:
    and isinstance(expr[1][0], list)

## Root Cause
The function attempts to access expr[1][0] without first checking if expr[1] is non-empty. When expr[1] is an empty list [], accessing the first element raises an IndexError.

## Expected Behavior
Based on the function's pattern and Python's behavior:
- dict([]) returns {}
- The unquote function should convert (dict, []) to {}
- This is consistent with how it handles other empty constructors:
  - (tuple, []) -> ()
  - (list, []) -> []
  - (set, []) -> set()

## Test Results
- The bug is 100% reproducible
- The proposed fix (checking if the list is empty before accessing expr[1][0]) works correctly
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with all existing test cases
