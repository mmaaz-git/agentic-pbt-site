## Documentation Analysis

### Official Django Documentation
I searched the official Django documentation but found NO explicit documentation for the `_sqlite_format_dtdelta` function. This is an internal implementation detail of Django's SQLite backend that is not publicly documented.

### Source Code Documentation
The function has minimal documentation:
1. **Docstring** (lines 250-255): Only describes input parameter types, not return types
2. **Inline comment** (lines 265-266): States "It will be formatted as '%Y-%m-%d' or '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S[.%f]'" - This comment strongly implies string formatting is expected

### Function Context
1. The function is registered with SQLite via `create_deterministic_function("django_format_dtdelta", 3, _sqlite_format_dtdelta)`
2. It's used internally by Django's SQLite operations for datetime delta calculations
3. The function name includes "format" which conventionally implies string output

### SQLite Documentation
Per SQLite's documentation (sqlite.org/c3ref/create_function.html):
- User-defined functions CAN return different types dynamically
- There's no strict requirement for type consistency across invocations
- SQLite is dynamically typed and accepts various return types

### Key Finding
While SQLite technically allows different return types, the function's:
1. Name ("format_dtdelta")
2. Comment about formatting ("It will be formatted as...")
3. Partial implementation (2 of 4 paths call str())

All suggest that consistent string returns were intended. The lack of explicit documentation means we must rely on:
- Code intent (function naming)
- Implementation patterns (partial str() usage)
- Comments in the code

### Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly specify return types, but contextual evidence (function name, comments, partial implementation) strongly suggests all operations should return formatted strings. The inconsistency appears to be an implementation oversight rather than intentional design.
