DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR dask.array.diff
==========================================

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FOR dask.array.diff:
----------------------------------------------
The function is documented as follows:
- Function Signature: dask.array.diff(a, n=1, axis=-1, prepend=None, append=None)
- Purpose: Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis
- Parameters:
  - a: Input array
  - n: Number of times values are differenced (default: 1)
  - axis: Axis along which the difference is taken (default: last axis)
  - prepend: Values to prepend to array before differencing
  - append: Values to append to array before differencing
- Return Value: An ndarray with the n-th differences

The documentation indicates that this function is "copied from NumPy's diff function with potential Dask-specific variations" but does not specify what those variations should be.

2. DASK ARRAY DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
--------------------------------
From the Dask array design documentation:
- Dask arrays are designed around lazy evaluation - computation is deferred until explicitly requested
- Dask arrays are represented as computational graphs where operations build up the graph
- The design emphasizes maintaining lazy evaluation throughout the computation pipeline
- Arrays are stored as a collection of blocks with deferred computation

3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSISTENCY:
------------------------------
The documentation does NOT explicitly state:
- Whether internal operations must consistently use dask functions over numpy functions
- Whether broadcast_to specifically must be from dask.array rather than numpy
- Any requirement that prepend and append parameters must be handled identically

4. LAZY EVALUATION CONTRACT:
----------------------------
While Dask's general design principle is lazy evaluation, the documentation does not explicitly state that:
- Every internal operation MUST use dask functions
- Using numpy functions internally violates the lazy evaluation contract
- There's a specific requirement for consistency between prepend/append handling

5. NOTABLE GAPS IN DOCUMENTATION:
---------------------------------
The documentation does not address:
- Internal implementation requirements for consistency
- Whether mixing numpy and dask functions internally is acceptable
- Specific guidelines for when to use dask.array functions vs numpy functions internally
- Whether the current mixed implementation (dask broadcast for prepend, numpy broadcast for append) is intentional or a bug

CONCLUSION:
----------
The documentation does not explicitly require that internal operations must consistently use dask functions over numpy functions. While Dask follows lazy evaluation principles, there's no documented requirement that forbids using numpy functions internally when they produce the same result. The claim that this "violates the expected behavior that all intermediate operations should use dask arrays for lazy evaluation" is not supported by explicit documentation.
