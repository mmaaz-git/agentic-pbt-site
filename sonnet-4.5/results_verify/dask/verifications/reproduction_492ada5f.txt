REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the Hypothesis test and manual reproduction confirm the issue.

Test Results:
-------------

1. Hypothesis Test with width=-1:
   - The test immediately fails with: "ValueError: Sign not allowed in string format specifier"
   - The error occurs in the _draw_bar method at line 147 of progress.py
   - The specific problem is in the format string: "{0:<{1}}" where {1} is the width value

2. Manual Reproduction:
   - Same error as the Hypothesis test
   - The ProgressBar constructor accepts width=-1 without any validation
   - The error only occurs when the progress bar tries to display itself
   - The error happens in both the timer thread and the main thread when _draw_bar is called

Error Details:
--------------
The error traceback shows:
```
File "/dask/diagnostics/progress.py", line 147, in _draw_bar
    msg = "\r[{0:<{1}}] | {2}% Completed | {3}".format(
        bar, self._width, percent, elapsed
    )
ValueError: Sign not allowed in string format specifier
```

The issue is that Python's string formatting does not accept negative values for field width specifiers. The format string "{0:<{1}}" expects {1} to be a non-negative integer representing the field width for left-aligned text.

Verification:
------------
- The bug report accurately describes the issue
- The error occurs exactly as stated in the report
- The constructor accepts negative width values without validation
- The crash only happens when the progress bar attempts to render
- The suggested fix location (adding validation in __init__) is appropriate
