REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The reproduction confirms:

1. **Hypothesis Test Confirmation**: The property-based test fails as expected, demonstrating that float division produces different offsets than integer division. The test correctly identifies that the issue exists for various size/blocksize combinations where size % blocksize != 0.

2. **Specific Example Verification**: The failing input (size=6356, blocksize=37) reproduces exactly as described:
   - Float division produces blocksize1 = 37.16959064327485
   - Integer division would produce blocksize1 = 37
   - The offsets diverge progressively, reaching a 28-byte difference at offset 170
   - Float-based offset 170: 6318
   - Int-based offset 170: 6290

3. **Source Code Verification**: Confirmed the bug exists at line 125 of /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/bytes/core.py:
   ```python
   blocksize1 = size / (size // blocksize)  # Uses float division
   ```

4. **Functional Impact**: Despite the incorrect use of float division:
   - The function still reads files correctly (no data corruption)
   - Both approaches sum to the correct total file size
   - The lengths array compensates for the float arithmetic
   - The last block absorbs any rounding differences

5. **Observable Effects**: The float division causes:
   - Non-uniform block lengths (some 37, some 38 bytes in the test case)
   - Offsets that accumulate floating-point errors
   - Semantically incorrect code that violates type expectations

The bug is real and reproducible, though it does not cause data corruption due to the way lengths are calculated from the offsets.
