## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully ran both the specific example and the hypothesis-based property test provided in the bug report.

### Specific Example Results
The bug report's specific example was confirmed:

**Original DataFrame:**
- Values: `['hello', 1, None]`
- Types: `['str', 'int', 'NoneType']`
- dtype: `object`

**After from_pandas().compute():**
- Values: `['hello', '1', <NA>]`
- Types: `['str', 'str', 'NAType']`
- dtype: `StringDtype(storage=pyarrow, na_value=<NA>)`

### Confirmed Behaviors
1. **Type conversion occurs**: The integer `1` was converted to string `'1'`
2. **None becomes NA**: Python's `None` was converted to pandas' `<NA>`
3. **dtype changes**: Column dtype changed from `object` to `StringDtype(storage=pyarrow)`
4. **Round-trip fails**: `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(pdf, result)` raises an error

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test immediately failed on the first example with mixed-type columns:
- Test generated DataFrames with mixed integers, floats, and strings in object columns
- All such DataFrames failed the round-trip equality test
- The failure was consistent: dtype changed from `object` to `StringDtype`

### Technical Analysis
The behavior is consistent and reproducible:
1. When Dask encounters an object column with mixed types, it attempts to infer a more specific type
2. If the column contains any strings, it converts the entire column to `StringDtype`
3. This conversion stringifies all non-string values (integers become string representations)
4. The conversion appears to be happening during the `from_pandas` operation, not during `compute()`

### Impact Assessment
The bug report's technical claims are accurate:
- Data is modified during the conversion process
- The round-trip property fails
- Non-string values in mixed object columns are silently converted to strings
- This could cause downstream errors for code expecting the original types
