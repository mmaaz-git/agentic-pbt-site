## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug):
**Strong Evidence:**
1. The function's docstring explicitly shows bytes input is supported: `>>> key_split(b'hello-world-1')`
2. The function has a catch-all exception handler that returns "Other" for problematic inputs
3. The crash violates the documented behavior - bytes are shown as valid input
4. The exception handler's clear intent is to handle edge cases gracefully
5. The bug is easily reproducible and affects a documented use case
6. The fix is straightforward and aligns with the function's design intent

**This appears to be a clear BUG** - the function fails to handle a documented input type properly.

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Weak Evidence:**
1. One could argue that the bytes example only shows valid UTF-8 bytes
2. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise to handle invalid UTF-8

**Counter-argument:** The presence of a catch-all exception handler strongly suggests the function is meant to be robust. If invalid UTF-8 bytes were intentionally unsupported, the function should either:
- Document this limitation
- Let the error propagate without a catch-all handler
- Have the bytes handling inside the try block

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Weak Evidence:**
1. Invalid UTF-8 bytes might be considered an extremely rare edge case
2. Most real-world Dask keys are probably valid UTF-8

**Counter-argument:**
- The bug breaks the idempotence property test, which is a fundamental property
- The fix is trivial (3 lines of code)
- The function already has infrastructure to handle errors (returns "Other")
- Binary data keys could reasonably appear in data processing workflows

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Some Evidence:**
1. The documentation could be clearer about UTF-8 requirements for bytes
2. The catch-all handler's scope could be better documented

**Counter-argument:** The code behavior (crashing) clearly contradicts the documented intent (handling edge cases). This is a code bug, not a documentation issue.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Weak Evidence:**
1. Handling invalid UTF-8 could be seen as a new feature

**Counter-argument:**
- Bytes input is already documented as supported
- The catch-all exception handler shows error handling is already a "feature"
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality

## Final Assessment:

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. **Documented support**: The docstring explicitly shows bytes input with an example
2. **Design intent**: The catch-all exception handler demonstrates the function is designed to handle problematic inputs gracefully
3. **Structural issue**: The bug is caused by a simple oversight - the bytes decoding happens before the try block
4. **Easy fix**: The solution is trivial and consistent with the function's design
5. **Real impact**: The bug breaks property-based tests and could affect production code
6. **No ambiguity**: There's no reasonable interpretation where crashing on certain bytes inputs is the intended behavior when a catch-all handler exists

The function promises to handle bytes input (via documentation) and promises to handle errors gracefully (via exception handler), but fails to do both for invalid UTF-8 bytes. This is a textbook bug.
