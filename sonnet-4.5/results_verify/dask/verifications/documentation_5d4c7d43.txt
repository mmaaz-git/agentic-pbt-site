DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

I reviewed the documentation for dask.utils.format_bytes from multiple sources:

1. SOURCE CODE DOCSTRING (dask/utils.py, lines 1772-1789):
The function's docstring explicitly states:
"For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

This is a clear, unambiguous guarantee about the function's behavior. It's not a side comment or implementation detail - it's part of the official documentation in the docstring.

2. ONLINE DOCUMENTATION:
The Dask online documentation (docs.dask.org) reflects the same docstring, including the 10-character guarantee. This means the claim is not just in the source code but also in the public-facing API documentation.

3. PURPOSE AND USE CASE:
The documentation explains that format_bytes is used to "Format bytes as text" for human-readable display. The 10-character guarantee is likely intended for formatting purposes, such as:
- Fixed-width displays in terminals
- Aligned columns in tables
- Consistent formatting in logs or monitoring dashboards

4. CONTRACT VIOLATION:
The documentation makes an explicit promise: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
This is a documented contract that users can rely upon. The implementation violates this contract for values that produce outputs like "1000.00 PiB", "1001.00 PiB", etc., which are 11 characters long.

5. BINARY PREFIXES:
The function correctly uses binary prefixes (kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB) rather than decimal prefixes, which is standard for memory/storage measurements in computing contexts.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation contains a clear, explicit guarantee about output length that the implementation fails to honor. This is not ambiguous or subject to interpretation - it's a straightforward contract violation.
