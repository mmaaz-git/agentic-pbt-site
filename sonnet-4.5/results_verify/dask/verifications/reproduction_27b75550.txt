## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

I successfully reproduced the bug using both the specific test case and the hypothesis property test provided in the bug report.

### Test Results:

1. **Specific Test Case** (n_divs=7, freq='W', closed='left', label='left'):
   - Input divisions: 7 timestamps from 2000-01-01 to 2000-01-31
   - Output outdivs: Contains duplicate at positions 5 and 6 (both are 2000-01-30)
   - Violates strict monotonicity requirement

2. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The test correctly identifies the monotonicity violation
   - The assertion `outdivs[i] < outdivs[i+1]` fails when duplicates are present

### Root Cause Analysis:

The bug occurs in lines 98-101 of resample.py. When certain conditions are met:
1. `len(newdivs) < len(divs)` causes the setter to be `append`
2. `outdivs[-1] < divisions[-1]` triggers line 101
3. Line 101 executes `setter(outdivs, temp.index[-1])`
4. However, `temp.index[-1]` equals `outdivs[-1]` (both are 2000-01-30)
5. This appends a duplicate value to outdivs

### Technical Impact:

The function produces `outdivs` with duplicate consecutive values:
- outdivs[5] = 2000-01-30 00:00:00
- outdivs[6] = 2000-01-30 00:00:00

This violates the dask requirement that divisions must be strictly monotonically increasing (no duplicates).

### Verification:

The bug is reproducible and the technical analysis in the bug report is accurate. The suggested fix (removing lines 98-99) would prevent the duplicate from being added, as the outdivs[-1] value is already correct when it's greater than or equal to divisions[-1].
