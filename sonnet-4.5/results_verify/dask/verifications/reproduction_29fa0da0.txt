# Bug Reproduction Analysis

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in dask.bag.from_sequence.

## Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Property Test**: FAILED
   - The property test quickly found a failing case: seq of length 5 with npartitions=4 produces 3 partitions instead of 4
   - This confirms the bug exists across various input combinations

2. **Manual Test Case**: FAILED
   - Input: seq=[1, 2, 3, 4], npartitions=3
   - Expected: 3 partitions
   - Actual: 2 partitions

3. **Specific Failing Case from Report**: FAILED
   - Input: seq=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], npartitions=4
   - Expected: 4 partitions
   - Actual: 3 partitions

4. **Downstream zip() Problem**: FAILED
   - bag1 with [0, 0, 0] and npartitions=3 creates 3 partitions
   - bag2 with [0, 0, 0, 0] and npartitions=3 creates 2 partitions
   - db.zip(bag1, bag2) fails with AssertionError due to different partition counts

## Root Cause Analysis

Examining the source code at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/bag/core.py lines 1789-1808:

The function calculates a `partition_size` from the requested `npartitions`:
- For sequences <= 100 items: `partition_size = int(math.ceil(len(seq) / npartitions))`
- For sequences > 100 items: `partition_size = max(1, int(math.floor(len(seq) / npartitions)))`

Then it uses `partition_all(partition_size, seq)` to create the partitions.

The problem is that this approach doesn't guarantee exactly `npartitions` partitions:
- Example: seq of length 4 with npartitions=3
  - partition_size = ceil(4/3) = 2
  - partition_all(2, [1,2,3,4]) creates [[1,2], [3,4]] = 2 partitions (not 3!)

## Impact

This is a real bug that:
1. Violates the API contract - users specify npartitions expecting that many partitions
2. Causes downstream failures - functions like db.zip() require equal partition counts
3. Makes it impossible to reliably create bags with matching partition counts for different sequence lengths

The bug report is accurate and the reproduction code correctly demonstrates the issue.
