DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

Documentation Review:
--------------------
I reviewed the official dask documentation for dask.bag.Bag.join and the inline documentation in the source code.

Key Findings:
1. The documentation states that the `other` parameter can be:
   - An iterable
   - A delayed object
   - A single-partition Bag

2. The documentation does NOT explicitly specify what exceptions are raised for invalid input types.

3. The source code (lines 1200-1205) shows that the method is intended to raise a TypeError when the input is not one of the accepted types, with a specific error message explaining what types are accepted.

4. The error message in the code attempts to be helpful by telling users:
   "Joined argument must be single-partition Bag, delayed object, or Iterable, got %s"
   where %s should show the actual type that was passed.

Analysis:
--------
The code's intention is clear and correct: it should raise a TypeError when given invalid input. The bug is purely in the implementation of the error message construction, not in the design or intended behavior.

The documentation doesn't need to explicitly list every exception that might be raised (this is common in Python documentation). The fact that a TypeError should be raised for invalid types is reasonable and expected behavior.

The bug is not about the exception type being wrong or the validation logic being incorrect - it's about a typo (`__name` instead of `__name__`) that prevents the intended error message from being displayed.

Conclusion:
----------
This is not a documentation issue. The code's intended behavior (raising TypeError for invalid input) is correct and reasonable. The bug is a simple implementation error that prevents the intended error from being raised properly.
