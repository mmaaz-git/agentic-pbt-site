REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. BUG REPRODUCTION - CONFIRMED:
The exact test case from the bug report produces the reported error:
- Input: stats=[{'columns': [{'name': 'a', 'min': None, 'max': None}]}, {'columns': [{'name': 'a', 'min': 5, 'max': 10}]}]
- Error: TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'NoneType'
- Location: Line 433 in sorted_columns function

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The bug occurs in this sequence:
a) First row group has min=None and max=None
b) The function sets max = c["max"] (which becomes None)
c) The function sets success = c["min"] is not None (which becomes False)
d) For the second row group with min=5, max=10:
   - The function checks if c["min"] is None (it's not, it's 5)
   - The function then tries to compare: c["min"] >= max (5 >= None)
   - This comparison fails with TypeError

3. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
The hypothesis test revealed multiple failure cases:
- Any case where first row group has None statistics and second has valid values triggers the bug
- The bug is consistent and reproducible across many random inputs
- Cases where None appears later in the sequence are handled correctly

4. EXISTING CODE BEHAVIOR:
The function already handles several None cases correctly:
- When None appears in later row groups (not the first), it's handled properly
- When all row groups have None values, it returns empty list
- It checks for c["min"] is None before breaking

5. MISSING LOGIC:
The function fails to check if max is None before the comparison at line 433. This is an oversight since the function already demonstrates awareness of None values elsewhere in the code.

6. TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS OF BUG REPORT:
- The bug description is accurate
- The reproduction code works as stated
- The TypeError message matches exactly
- The proposed fix would resolve the issue

SUMMARY:
The bug is real, reproducible, and the technical details in the report are correct. The function attempts to handle None values but has an incomplete implementation that misses one critical check.
