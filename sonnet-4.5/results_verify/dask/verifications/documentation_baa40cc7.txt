DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION (dask/utils.py):
   The function `format_bytes` has clear documentation in its docstring:

   Lines 1771-1789 show:
   - Function signature: def format_bytes(n: int) -> str
   - Purpose: "Format bytes as text"
   - Examples showing various byte sizes being formatted
   - EXPLICIT CONTRACT on line 1788: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

2. OFFICIAL DASK DOCUMENTATION:
   The online documentation at https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/api.html#dask.utils.format_bytes
   confirms the same constraint: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

3. DOCUMENTATION CLARITY:
   The documentation is unambiguous and explicit:
   - It clearly states a mathematical constraint: for ALL values less than 2^60
   - It promises a specific behavior: output will ALWAYS be <= 10 characters
   - This is not a suggestion or typical behavior, but a documented invariant

4. USER EXPECTATIONS:
   Users may reasonably rely on this documented constraint for:
   - Fixed-width formatting in terminal output
   - UI layout calculations
   - Buffer size allocations
   - Table column width calculations

5. IMPLEMENTATION VS DOCUMENTATION:
   The current implementation violates the documented contract for values >= 1000 PiB:
   - The documentation promises <= 10 chars for all values < 2^60
   - Values from 1000 PiB to 1024 PiB (which is 2^60) produce 11-character outputs
   - This is a clear discrepancy between documented behavior and actual behavior

6. NO AMBIGUITY:
   There is no ambiguity in the documentation that would suggest this behavior is acceptable:
   - The word "always" is used explicitly
   - The constraint applies to "all values < 2^60"
   - There are no caveats or exceptions mentioned

CONCLUSION:
The documentation explicitly promises a behavior that the code does not deliver. This is not a case
of undefined behavior, unclear documentation, or reasonable interpretation differences. The function
violates its own clearly stated contract.
