## Documentation Analysis for _resample_bin_and_out_divs

### Function Purpose
The `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` function is an internal helper function in the dask dataframe resample module. It computes new division boundaries for resampling operations on time series dataframes.

### Key Findings:

1. **Function is Internal**: The function name starts with underscore (_resample_bin_and_out_divs), indicating it's an internal/private function not part of the public API.

2. **No Direct Documentation**: There is no docstring for this function. It's used internally by the ResampleReduction class as shown in line 147-149 of resample.py.

3. **Division Requirements from Dask**: Based on the codebase analysis:
   - Divisions in dask must be monotonically increasing (found in _expr.py validation code)
   - When divisions are not monotonic, dask raises ValueError: "The renamer creates an Index with non-monotonic divisions. This is not allowed."
   - Divisions are a fundamental concept in dask - they mark the boundaries between partitions and must be strictly ordered to allow efficient operations

4. **Function Returns**: The function returns two tuples:
   - `newdivs`: New divisions for the resampled data
   - `outdivs`: Output divisions after resampling

5. **Division Invariants**: From the error message found in the code and general dask principles:
   - Divisions must be strictly monotonically increasing (no duplicates, always ascending)
   - This is enforced in other parts of dask (e.g., rename operations check for monotonic_increasing)
   - Violations of monotonic divisions can break dask's partitioning assumptions

### Conclusion on Documentation:
While there's no explicit documentation for this specific internal function, the broader dask framework clearly requires divisions to be strictly monotonically increasing without duplicates. This is an invariant that all division-producing functions must maintain.
