# Documentation Analysis

## Dask DataFrame Compatibility Claims

### General Compatibility Promise
The Dask documentation makes strong claims about pandas compatibility:
1. "Dask DataFrame copies pandas, and so should be familiar to most users"
2. "The API is the same. The execution is the same."
3. Dask DataFrames are described as "Just pandas" with parallel execution
4. The goal is to provide a "lazy" parallel version of pandas that maintains pandas-like behavior

### Resample Method Documentation
The resample method documentation states:
- "This docstring was copied from pandas.core.frame.DataFrame.resample"
- Several parameters are explicitly noted as "Not supported in Dask" (axis, convention, kind, on, level, origin, offset, group_keys)
- However, the parameters used in the bug report (rule, closed, label) ARE supported

### Key Finding
The documentation establishes that:
1. Dask aims to match pandas behavior for supported features
2. The resample method with 'rule', 'closed', and 'label' parameters is a supported feature
3. There is no documented caveat that quarterly resampling with closed='right' and label='right' should behave differently than pandas

## Conclusion
Based on the documentation:
- Dask explicitly promises pandas compatibility for supported operations
- The resample operation with the parameters in question IS supported
- There is no documented exception or warning that this specific combination would produce different results
- The documentation creates a reasonable expectation that Dask should match pandas behavior for this operation

Therefore, the incorrect result (0.0 instead of 29394.0) violates the documented contract of pandas compatibility.
