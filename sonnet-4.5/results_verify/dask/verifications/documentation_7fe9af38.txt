DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Function Documentation
The `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` function is an internal/private function (indicated by the underscore prefix) and has no official public documentation. It is not part of Dask's public API.

## Dask Divisions Documentation
According to official Dask documentation:
1. Divisions represent the minimum and maximum index values of each partition
2. Divisions are boundaries that mark the lower/upper bounds of each partition's index
3. For divisions = (0, 10, 50, 100), partitions contain values [0, 10), [10, 50), and [50, 100]
4. Divisions enable efficient operations by allowing Dask to know which partition contains a given value

## Resample Function Documentation
The public resample() function documentation covers:
- The 'closed' parameter controls which side of the bin interval is closed
- The 'label' parameter determines which bin edge labels the bucket
- No explicit statement about how divisions should behave after resampling

## Key Findings

### What the documentation DOES say:
- Divisions represent actual data boundaries within partitions
- Divisions should reflect the minimum and maximum values contained in the data
- The documentation states divisions "includes the minimum value of every partition's index"

### What the documentation DOES NOT say:
- There is no explicit statement that divisions can extend beyond actual data boundaries
- There is no documentation suggesting it's acceptable for outdivs to precede input divisions
- The internal function _resample_bin_and_out_divs has no documented behavior

## Implications
While the function is internal and undocumented, the broader Dask documentation strongly implies that divisions should represent actual data boundaries. Having outdivs[0] precede divisions[0] violates the general principle that divisions mark the actual bounds of contained data.

The fact that the code already constrains newdivs[0] to not precede divisions[0] (lines 90-91) further suggests this was an intended invariant that was incompletely implemented.
