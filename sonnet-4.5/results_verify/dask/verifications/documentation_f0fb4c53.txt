## Documentation Review for dask.bytes.read_bytes

### Function Documentation:

The function `read_bytes` is documented in dask/bytes/core.py with the following key information:

1. **Purpose**: Given a path or paths, return delayed objects that read from those paths. It cleanly breaks data by a delimiter if given, so that block boundaries start directly after a delimiter and end on the delimiter.

2. **Blocksize Parameter**:
   - Type: int, str
   - Description: "Chunk size in bytes, defaults to '128 MiB'"
   - The documentation describes it as the size of chunks in bytes

3. **Expected Behavior**: The documentation states that the function should "cleanly breaks data" into blocks. The word "cleanly" implies that blocks should have well-defined, consistent boundaries.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns blocks as lists of delayed objects, where each computes to a block of bytes from the file.

### Documentation Analysis:

**What the documentation DOES specify:**
- Blocksize is the chunk size in bytes
- Data should be "cleanly" broken into blocks
- Blocks should align with delimiters if provided

**What the documentation DOES NOT specify:**
- The exact algorithm for calculating block offsets
- Whether floating-point or integer arithmetic should be used
- How to handle cases where file size is not evenly divisible by blocksize
- The precision requirements for block offset calculations

### Key Finding:

The documentation does not explicitly state that integer arithmetic must be used for offset calculations. However, there are implicit expectations:

1. **"Chunk size in bytes"** - The parameter is described as a size in bytes, which are discrete integer units. Using floating-point arithmetic to calculate byte offsets is counterintuitive.

2. **"cleanly breaks data"** - The word "cleanly" suggests precise, consistent boundaries without ambiguity.

3. **Common Practice** - In file I/O operations, byte offsets are universally integers. Using floating-point arithmetic for byte positions is highly unusual and error-prone.

### Conclusion:

While the documentation doesn't explicitly mandate integer arithmetic, the use of floating-point division for byte offset calculations violates reasonable expectations:

1. Bytes are discrete units that should be addressed with integer arithmetic
2. Floating-point arithmetic introduces precision issues that can lead to inconsistent behavior
3. The term "cleanly breaks" implies deterministic, precise boundaries

The bug represents a violation of implicit but reasonable expectations about how byte offsets should be calculated in file I/O operations. This is not merely a documentation issue but a genuine implementation bug that could lead to subtle issues in production code.
