DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR _resample_bin_and_out_divs

Function Location: dask/dataframe/tseries/resample.py, lines 66-103
Function Purpose: Internal function to compute bin and output divisions for resampling operations

Documentation Status:
- The function is an INTERNAL function (starts with underscore)
- Has NO docstring or explicit documentation
- No public API documentation exists for this function
- Function is called internally by ResampleReduction._resample_divisions (line 147)

Dask Divisions Requirements (from official documentation):
1. Divisions are tuple of npartitions + 1 values in ASCENDING ORDER
2. Mark the lower/upper bounds of each partition's index
3. MUST be monotonically increasing to enable efficient operations
4. Example: divisions = (0, 10, 50, 100) means partitions contain [0, 10), [10, 50), [50, 100]
5. Documentation explicitly states divisions must be "in ascending order"

Key Documentation Quotes:
- "Divisions are a tuple of npartitions + 1 values, in ascending order"
- "To preserve the input ordering... make sure the input index is monotonically-increasing"
- "For operations with monotonically increasing transformations, divisions should be preserved"

Function Returns:
- Two tuples: (newdivs, outdivs)
- newdivs: divisions for internal partitioning
- outdivs: divisions for output result
- Both are expected to follow standard Dask divisions requirements

Conclusion:
The function has no explicit documentation about its behavior, but as it returns "divisions" that are used throughout Dask's partitioning system, these divisions MUST follow Dask's fundamental requirement of being monotonically increasing (strictly ascending order). This is not a documentation ambiguity - it's a core architectural requirement of Dask.
