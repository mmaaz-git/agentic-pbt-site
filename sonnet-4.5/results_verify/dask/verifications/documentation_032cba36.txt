## Documentation Analysis for sorted_division_locations

### Function Documentation (from docstring)

The function `sorted_division_locations` is documented with clear examples in its docstring (lines 256-278 of dask/dataframe/io/io.py). The docstring explicitly shows examples using plain Python lists:

1. `L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']` with various chunksizes
2. `L = ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C']` with duplicate handling
3. `['A']` as a single-element list

The docstring states: "Find division locations and values in sorted list"

### Function Parameters

According to the function signature and docstring:
- `seq`: The input sequence (examples show Python lists)
- `npartitions`: Optional, number of partitions to create
- `chunksize`: Optional, size of each chunk

The function requires exactly one of `npartitions` or `chunksize` to be specified.

### Implementation Details

The actual implementation (lines 284-287) contains this logic:
```python
if isinstance(seq, list):
    pass
else:
    seq = tolist(seq)
```

This shows that:
1. If the input IS already a Python list, it's used as-is (no conversion needed)
2. If the input is NOT a list, it's converted to a list using the `tolist` dispatch function
3. The `tolist` function is only needed for non-list types (numpy arrays, pandas Series, etc.)

### Comment in Code

Line 282-283 contains a comment: "Convert from an ndarray to a plain list so that any divisions we extract from seq are plain Python scalars."

This comment indicates the purpose of the conversion is to ensure plain Python scalars are used for divisions, and it specifically mentions converting FROM ndarrays (not from lists).

### Conclusion

The documentation (both in docstrings and code comments) clearly shows that plain Python lists are the expected and supported input format. The function is designed to accept lists directly and convert other array-like types TO lists for processing.
