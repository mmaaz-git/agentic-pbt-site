REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR _aggregate_columns BUG
================================================

Bug Claim: The function enters an infinite loop when called with an empty list as input.

Reproduction Method:
1. Direct test with empty list input
2. Hypothesis property-based test
3. Manual trace through the code logic

TEST 1: Direct Test with Empty List
------------------------------------
Result: CONFIRMED - Function enters infinite loop
- Called _aggregate_columns([], {})
- Function hung indefinitely (terminated after 2-second timeout)
- The while True loop never terminates because:
  * The for loop over empty cols executes 0 iterations
  * No IndexError is raised (the loop body never runs)
  * The loop continues forever, incrementing i and adding empty lists to combine

TEST 2: Hypothesis Property Test
---------------------------------
Result: CONFIRMED - Hypothesis test finds the bug immediately
- The test generates various inputs including empty lists
- When cols=[], the function times out
- This confirms the bug is reproducible through property-based testing

TEST 3: Manual Code Trace
-------------------------
Result: CONFIRMED - Logic analysis shows infinite loop
When cols is empty:
- Iteration 1: i=0, creates empty inner list, for loop runs 0 times, no IndexError, i++
- Iteration 2: i=1, creates empty inner list, for loop runs 0 times, no IndexError, i++
- Iteration 3: i=2, creates empty inner list, for loop runs 0 times, no IndexError, i++
- ... continues forever

When cols is non-empty (e.g., [[1,2], [3,4]]):
- Iteration 1: i=0, processes col[0][0]=1 and col[1][0]=3, no error, i++
- Iteration 2: i=1, processes col[0][1]=2 and col[1][1]=4, no error, i++
- Iteration 3: i=2, tries col[0][2], raises IndexError, breaks correctly

Technical Analysis:
The bug is a logic error in the termination condition. The code assumes that:
1. The for loop will execute at least once
2. Eventually col[i] will be out of bounds and raise IndexError
3. This IndexError will be caught and break the while loop

However, when cols is empty:
- The for loop body never executes (0 iterations)
- No array access col[i] ever happens
- No IndexError can be raised
- The while True loop continues forever

Severity Assessment:
- The bug is REAL and REPRODUCIBLE
- It causes an infinite loop (program hang) with empty list input
- This is an internal/private function (starts with _)
- The function is only called internally within parquet statistics aggregation
- Unlikely to be triggered in normal usage (statistics aggregation typically has data)
