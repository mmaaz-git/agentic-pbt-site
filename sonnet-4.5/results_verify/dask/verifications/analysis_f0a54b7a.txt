## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible - the function DOES mutate the input parameter
- Parameter mutation without documentation violates Python conventions
- Even internal functions shouldn't have unexpected side effects
- The behavior is not documented anywhere

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- It's a private function (starts with _), so no public API guarantees
- The public read_orc function appears to work around this issue already

**Verdict: NOT INVALID** - The bug is real and violates programming conventions

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- It's an internal function that users shouldn't call directly
- The public API (read_orc) already handles this by filtering the index
- The impact is minimal since it's not in the public interface
- Changing it might break existing internal code that depends on this behavior

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- Even internal functions should follow good practices
- The mutation could cause bugs in maintenance or future development
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- Other internal code might be affected by this unexpected mutation

**Verdict: POSSIBLY WONTFIX** - Since it's internal and the public API works around it

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The behavior could be documented as intentional
- Adding a docstring warning about mutation would clarify the behavior

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The behavior appears to be a bug, not an intentional design
- Documenting bad behavior doesn't make it good
- The public read_orc already works around this issue, suggesting it's not intended

**Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX** - This is a code issue, not a documentation issue

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be seen as requesting improved behavior for internal functions

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The non-mutating behavior should be the default, not a new feature

**Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST** - This is a bug fix, not a new feature

### Considering BUG:
**Arguments for BUG:**
- Function mutates input parameters without documentation
- Violates Python conventions and principle of least surprise
- The fix is simple and correct (create new list instead of mutating)
- Even the public API has to work around this behavior
- Could cause subtle bugs in concurrent operations or when reusing column lists
- PEP 8 suggests keeping functions side-effect free

**Arguments against BUG:**
- It's a private/internal function
- The public API already handles it correctly
- Low severity since users shouldn't call _read_orc directly

**Verdict: LIKELY BUG** - Despite being internal, it's still incorrect behavior

### Final Assessment:

This is a **BUG**, though potentially a low-priority one. While the function is internal (prefixed with _), it still exhibits incorrect behavior by mutating its input parameter without documentation. This violates:

1. Python's general convention against unexpected side effects
2. The principle of least surprise
3. Good programming practices for parameter handling

The fact that the public `read_orc` function has to work around this behavior (by pre-filtering the index from columns) suggests that even the developers recognize this isn't ideal behavior. The proposed fix is simple, correct, and would make the code more maintainable.

However, given that it's an internal function and the public API already works correctly, this could also be categorized as WONTFIX if the maintainers decide the risk of changing internal behavior outweighs the benefits. But from a pure correctness standpoint, this is a BUG.
