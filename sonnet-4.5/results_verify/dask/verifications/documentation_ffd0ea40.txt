## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation Review

The `sorted_division_locations` function has minimal documentation:

1. **Docstring**: The function includes only examples in its docstring, without explicit specification of:
   - What happens when `npartitions` cannot be satisfied due to duplicate values
   - The guaranteed relationship between `npartitions` and the length of returned divisions
   - Error handling behavior when insufficient unique values exist

2. **Examples in Docstring**: All examples use `chunksize` parameter, not `npartitions`. The examples show:
   - Cases with duplicates: `['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C']`
   - The function can return fewer divisions when duplicates exist
   - But no example demonstrates the `npartitions` parameter behavior

3. **Parameter Documentation**: The function accepts either `npartitions` or `chunksize` (mutually exclusive), but:
   - No documentation explains the expected behavior when `npartitions` is specified
   - No documentation states whether `npartitions + 1` divisions are guaranteed

4. **External Documentation**:
   - Could not find specific documentation for this function in Dask's public API docs
   - The function appears to be an internal utility (in `io.io` module)
   - No explicit contract about division count guarantees

### Key Observations

1. **Undocumented Behavior**: The function's behavior with `npartitions` when duplicates prevent creating the requested number of partitions is not documented.

2. **Internal Function**: This appears to be primarily an internal utility function used by other Dask components, not a primary public API.

3. **Implicit Expectations**: While not explicitly documented, the parameter name `npartitions` and common usage patterns in distributed computing suggest that requesting N partitions should result in N+1 division boundaries.

4. **Test Coverage**: The existing test `test_sorted_division_locations_duplicates` shows the function being used with duplicates, but doesn't verify the division count matches `npartitions + 1`.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly specify what should happen when the requested number of partitions cannot be created due to duplicate values. This is a documentation gap that leads to ambiguity about whether the current behavior is intentional or a bug.
