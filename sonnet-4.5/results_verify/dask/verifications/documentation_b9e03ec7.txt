DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Function Documentation

The `apply_filters` function has clear documentation in its docstring:

```python
def apply_filters(parts, statistics, filters):
    """Apply filters onto parts/statistics pairs

    Parameters
    ----------
    parts: list
        Tokens corresponding to row groups to read in the future
    statistics: List[dict]
        List of statistics for each part, including min and max values
    filters: Union[List[Tuple[str, str, Any]], List[List[Tuple[str, str, Any]]]]
        List of filters to apply, like ``[[('x', '=', 0), ...], ...]``. This
        implements partition-level (hive) filtering only, i.e., to prevent the
        loading of some row-groups and/or files.

        Predicates can be expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF). This means
        that the innermost tuple describes a single column predicate. These
        inner predicates are combined with an AND conjunction into a larger
        predicate. The outer-most list then combines all of the combined
        filters with an OR disjunction.

        Predicates can also be expressed as a List[Tuple]. These are evaluated
        as an AND conjunction. To express OR in predicates, one must use the
        (preferred) List[List[Tuple]] notation.

    Returns
    -------
    parts, statistics: the same as the input, but possibly a subset
    """
```

## Key Observations

1. **No Empty Filters Specification**: The documentation does not explicitly state what should happen when `filters` is an empty list. It only describes the format for non-empty filters.

2. **Return Value Semantics**: The documentation states the function returns "the same as the input, but possibly a subset". This implies:
   - The function should always return valid output
   - Output can be the same as input (no filtering) or a subset (some filtering applied)
   - An empty filter list would logically mean "no filtering", thus returning the original input

3. **Caller Context**: In the actual Dask codebase, `apply_filters` is called conditionally:
   ```python
   if self.filters and stats:
       parts, stats = apply_filters(parts, stats, self.filters)
   ```
   The caller explicitly checks that filters is non-empty before calling the function. This suggests the function was not designed to handle empty filters.

4. **Public vs Internal**: While the function appears to be internal (not documented in public API), it:
   - Is not prefixed with underscore
   - Has comprehensive docstring
   - Can be imported and called directly

## Documentation Gap

The documentation doesn't specify:
- Whether empty filters are valid input
- What the expected behavior should be for empty filters
- Whether the function is considered internal or public API

Given the return specification ("same as input, but possibly a subset"), the most reasonable interpretation is that empty filters should return the input unchanged, as no filtering criteria means no subset selection should occur.
