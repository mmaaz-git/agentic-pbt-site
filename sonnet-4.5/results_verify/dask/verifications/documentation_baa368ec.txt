DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR WhereNode.relabel_aliases

Based on my investigation of Django's documentation and source code:

1. METHOD DOCUMENTATION:
The WhereNode.relabel_aliases method has a docstring that states:
"Relabel the alias values of any children. 'change_map' is a dictionary mapping old (current) alias values to the new values."

This docstring describes WHAT the method does (relabels aliases) but does NOT specify what the method should return.

2. RETURN VALUE SPECIFICATION:
- The documentation does not explicitly state whether the method should return self, None, or any other value.
- There is no specification about whether the method supports method chaining.
- The docstring focuses only on the side effect (relabeling aliases) not on the return value.

3. USAGE PATTERNS IN DJANGO:
Looking at how the method is used in Django's own codebase:
- In django/db/models/sql/query.py, the return value is never captured or used
- Example: `self.where.relabel_aliases(change_map)` - the return value is ignored
- Example: `w.relabel_aliases(change_map)` - again, return value is ignored
- This suggests Django's internal code doesn't rely on the return value

4. INTERFACE CONSISTENCY:
- The base class (tree.Node) does not define a relabel_aliases method
- There is no abstract base class or interface that specifies what relabel_aliases should return
- Other similar mutation methods in Django's ORM sometimes return self for chaining, but this is not universally consistent

5. IMPLICIT BEHAVIOR:
The current implementation has an early return of `self` when change_map is empty (optimization to avoid unnecessary work), but no explicit return at the end of the method, causing Python to implicitly return None.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not specify what relabel_aliases should return. The behavior is technically unspecified, making this more of an implementation detail than a documented API contract. The inconsistent return value (self vs None) is not a violation of any documented behavior since no return value is documented.
