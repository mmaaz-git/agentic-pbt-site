## Documentation Analysis Report

### Function Documentation
The `apply_filters` function has clear docstring documentation that describes:
- Purpose: Apply filters onto parts/statistics pairs for partition-level (hive) filtering
- Parameters: parts (list of tokens), statistics (list of dicts with min/max values), filters (DNF predicates)
- Returns: Filtered subset of parts and statistics

### Apache Parquet Specification
According to the Apache Parquet format specification:
1. **Min/Max values are OPTIONAL** - The format explicitly states that min/max values in statistics are optional
2. **Partial statistics are valid** - It is possible and valid to have statistics where:
   - Only min is present (max is None)
   - Only max is present (min is None)
   - Both are None
   - null_count can be present independently of min/max
3. **Writers and readers responsibilities**:
   - Writers MAY omit min/max values
   - Readers MUST handle missing min/max values gracefully
   - Readers MUST distinguish between missing statistics and actual values

### Dask Documentation Findings
1. The Dask documentation mentions using row-group statistics for filtering optimizations
2. There's a known related issue (#9764) where filtering with None statistics caused TypeErrors
3. The documentation states that filtering should handle "missing" statistics gracefully

### Key Documentation Points
1. The comment on line 531 states "(main/max cannot be None for remaining checks)" but this is an internal implementation comment, not a specification requirement
2. The function is supposed to handle "row-groups with 'missing' stats" (line 518 comment)
3. The Apache Parquet specification explicitly allows partial statistics (one of min/max being None)
4. The function's docstring doesn't specify that both min and max must be present or both must be None

### Conclusion
The documentation and specifications clearly indicate that:
- Partial None values (one of min/max being None) are valid according to the Parquet specification
- The function claims to handle "missing" stats but fails to properly handle partial None cases
- This is a violation of the Parquet specification's requirement that readers MUST handle missing min/max values gracefully
