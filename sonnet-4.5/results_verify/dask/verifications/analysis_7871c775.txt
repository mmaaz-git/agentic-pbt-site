## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Why it IS a bug:**
1. The function violates an explicitly documented invariant
2. The docstring states "For all values < 2^60, the output is always <= 10 characters"
3. Values like 1125894277343089729 (which is < 2^60) produce 11-character output
4. This is a clear contract violation - the code does not do what the documentation promises
5. The documentation makes this guarantee in absolute terms ("always")
6. The limit is likely important for formatting consistency in output displays

**Strength:** VERY HIGH - Clear violation of documented behavior

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be invalid:**
1. None - the documentation is explicit and unambiguous
2. The behavior is clearly specified, not undefined
3. The test case uses valid inputs within the documented range

**Strength:** NONE - This is clearly not an invalid report

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. Values >= 1000 PiB are extremely large (over 1 exabyte)
2. In practice, such large values may be rare
3. The issue only affects a small portion of the valid input range

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
1. The documentation makes an explicit promise without caveats
2. The affected range (1000-1152 PiB) is still within the valid input domain
3. With modern data scales, petabyte-scale values are becoming more common
4. The fix is straightforward (adjust decimal places for large values)

**Strength:** WEAK - While edge case, it's still a documented guarantee

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code works reasonably - it formats bytes correctly
2. One could argue the documentation should be updated to say "usually <= 10 characters"
3. The 11-character output is still readable and functional

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The 10-character limit appears to be a deliberate design constraint
2. Changing documentation would break the API contract
3. Users may depend on this guarantee for formatting/alignment
4. The code can be fixed to maintain the guarantee

**Strength:** MODERATE - Could go either way, but fixing code is better

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. None - this is about existing functionality not meeting its specification

**Strength:** NONE - This is clearly not a feature request

### Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The function makes an explicit, unambiguous promise in its documentation that all outputs for values < 2^60 will be <= 10 characters. The implementation fails to honor this promise for values >= 1000 PiB. While these are edge cases, they are still within the documented valid input range, and the documentation makes no exceptions. The proper resolution is to fix the code to honor its documented contract, not to weaken the documentation.
