## Documentation Review

### Dask Documentation

1. **Official Documentation for mean()**: The documentation is extremely minimal, containing only "Arithmetic mean" with no details about:
   - Parameters
   - Return values
   - Error conditions
   - Behavior with empty bags
   - Edge cases

2. **General Dask Bag Documentation**: The main Dask Bag documentation page does not mention how statistical operations handle empty bags or any edge cases for these operations.

3. **No Specification for Empty Bag Behavior**: There is no documentation that specifies what should happen when calling `mean()` on an empty bag. The behavior is undefined in the documentation.

### Comparison with Related Libraries

1. **NumPy Behavior**: NumPy's mean function returns NaN for empty arrays (with a warning), which is a well-documented behavior and mathematically appropriate since mean of empty set is undefined.

2. **Python statistics module**: Explicitly raises StatisticsError with a clear message when attempting to compute mean of empty data.

3. **Pandas**: Returns NaN for empty Series, consistent with NumPy.

### Documentation Implications

The lack of documentation about edge cases means:
- Users have no way to know what to expect with empty bags
- The current ZeroDivisionError is not documented as expected behavior
- There's no guidance on how to handle this case in user code
- The error is low-level (ZeroDivisionError) rather than a semantic error that explains the actual problem

The documentation does not specify that mean() should work with empty bags, but it also doesn't specify that it shouldn't. Given that:
1. Other similar libraries handle this case more gracefully
2. The error message is not informative about the actual problem
3. Other dask.bag operations like count() handle empty bags correctly

This suggests the current behavior is likely unintended rather than by design.
