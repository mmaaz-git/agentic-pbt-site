## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report:

1. **NumPy baseline**: `np.eye(2, M=3)` works correctly, producing a 2x3 matrix with ones on the diagonal.

2. **Failing case**: `da.eye(2, chunks=3, M=3, k=0)` crashes with:
   - Error: "ValueError: Missing dependency ('eye-...', 0, 1) for dependents"
   - This occurs when N != M (non-square) and chunks >= M

3. **Working cases**:
   - `da.eye(2, chunks=2, M=3)` works (chunks < M)
   - `da.eye(3, chunks=3, M=3)` works (square matrix)
   - `da.eye(4, chunks=3, M=2)` works (different dimension ratio)

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug is in line 624 of `/dask/array/creation.py`:

```python
return Array(dsk, name_eye, shape=(N, M), chunks=(chunks, chunks), dtype=dtype)
```

The problem:
1. `normalize_chunks` correctly computes `vchunks` and `hchunks` based on the shape (N, M)
2. The code then extracts `chunks = vchunks[0]` (first element of vertical chunks)
3. The Array constructor is called with `chunks=(chunks, chunks)`, using the same value for both dimensions
4. This is incorrect when vchunks and hchunks differ (non-square matrices with certain chunk sizes)

Example with N=2, M=3, chunks=3:
- `normalize_chunks` returns: vchunks=(2,), hchunks=(3,)
- Code uses: chunks=2 (from vchunks[0])
- Array expects chunks=(2, 2) but tasks were created for chunks=(2, 3)
- This mismatch causes the "Missing dependency" error

### Fix Verification

The proposed fix changes line 624 to:
```python
return Array(dsk, name_eye, shape=(N, M), chunks=(vchunks, hchunks), dtype=dtype)
```

I tested this fix and confirmed:
- The failing case (N=2, M=3, chunks=3) now works correctly
- All other test cases continue to work
- The output matches NumPy's eye function exactly

### Technical Details

The bug only manifests when:
1. Creating non-square matrices (N != M)
2. The chunk size causes different chunking patterns for rows vs columns
3. Specifically when normalize_chunks produces different vchunks and hchunks

The fix is correct because it properly passes the actual computed chunks for both dimensions rather than incorrectly using the same value twice.
