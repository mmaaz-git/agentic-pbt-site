## Reproduction Analysis

### Successful Reproduction
The bug report is technically accurate. I successfully reproduced all the issues described:

1. **Negative Variance**: The specific failing input `[-356335.16553451226, -356335.16553451226, -356335.16553451226]` does produce a negative variance of `-3.0517578125e-05` when it should be exactly 0.

2. **Non-zero Variance for Identical Values**: When all values are identical, the variance should be exactly 0, but the implementation produces non-zero results:
   - Input `[259284.59765625] * 3` gives `7.62939453125e-06` instead of 0
   - Input `[1e15] * 10` gives `-140737488355328.0` instead of 0

3. **Numerical Instability**: The algorithm fails catastrophically for large values:
   - Values around 1e6 frequently produce negative variances
   - Values at 1e15 produce massive errors (off by 14 orders of magnitude)
   - Even moderate values like `[1e8, 1e8+1, 1e8-1]` produce completely wrong results (0 instead of 0.667)

### Root Cause Analysis
The implementation uses the formula: `Var(X) = E[X²] - E[X]²`

This is mathematically correct but numerically unstable due to:
1. **Catastrophic Cancellation**: When values are large, both `E[X²]` and `E[X]²` become very large numbers that are nearly equal. Subtracting them loses precision.
2. **Floating Point Precision**: For values like 1e15, squaring them exceeds floating point precision limits.

### Mathematical Verification
For identical values:
- Mean = value
- Variance = sum((value - mean)²) / n = sum(0²) / n = 0

The current implementation for identical values:
- E[X²] = value²
- E[X]² = value²
- Difference should be 0, but floating point errors make it non-zero (and sometimes negative)

### Impact Assessment
This is a serious numerical bug that:
- Violates mathematical invariants (variance cannot be negative)
- Produces incorrect results for common use cases (identical values, large values)
- Gets worse as data scales increase
- Would affect any statistical analysis using Dask's variance calculation
