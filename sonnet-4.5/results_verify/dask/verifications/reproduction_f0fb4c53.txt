## Bug Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in the dask.bytes.read_bytes function at line 125 of dask/bytes/core.py.

### Reproduction Steps Taken:

1. **Ran the Hypothesis Test**: The test failed as expected, confirming that float division produces different offsets than integer division for the same file size and blocksize parameters.

2. **Reproduced the Specific Example**:
   - File size: 1,000,000,001 bytes
   - Blocksize: 333,333,333 bytes
   - With float division: blocksize1 = 333333333.6666667
   - With integer division: blocksize1 = 333333333
   - Confirmed offset difference at index 2: 666666667 vs 666666666 (1 byte difference)

3. **Tested with Actual dask.bytes.read_bytes**: Created a test file of exactly 1,000,000,001 bytes and used dask's read_bytes function. While the total bytes read was correct (all bytes were covered), the offsets calculated were indeed different from what integer division would produce.

### Detailed Analysis of the Bug:

The bug occurs because line 125 uses float division:
```python
blocksize1 = size / (size // blocksize)  # Float division
```

This produces a floating-point blocksize1 value. When this float is accumulated in a loop and then truncated with `int(place)`, floating-point precision issues cause the offsets to differ from what pure integer arithmetic would produce.

**Float Division Results**:
- Offsets: [0, 333333333, 666666667]
- Lengths: [333333333, 333333334, 333333334]

**Integer Division Results**:
- Offsets: [0, 333333333, 666666666]
- Lengths: [333333333, 333333333, 333333335]

While both approaches read all bytes (sum of lengths = 1,000,000,001), the float division approach creates inconsistent block boundaries due to floating-point arithmetic. The second offset is off by 1 byte (666666667 vs 666666666).

### Impact:

While the current implementation does not miss any bytes (no gaps), it produces block offsets that are inconsistent with what would be expected from integer arithmetic. This could cause issues in scenarios where:
1. Precise, reproducible block boundaries are required
2. Block offsets need to align with specific byte positions
3. Consistent behavior across different systems with varying floating-point implementations is needed

The bug report is valid and accurately describes a real issue in the code.
