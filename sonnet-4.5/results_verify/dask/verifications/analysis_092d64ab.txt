## Bug Triage Analysis

### Analysis for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Clear contract violation - the docstring explicitly states `length=None` should "read through end of file"
2. The assertion `assert length is not None` directly contradicts the documented behavior
3. Inconsistent behavior - `length=None` works with delimiter but not without
4. The TODO comment shows developers acknowledge this gap between documentation and implementation
5. This is a reasonable use case - reading to end of file is a common operation
6. The suggested fix is straightforward and logical
7. User expectation based on documentation is violated

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None significant

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The TODO comment suggests developers have considered this but chosen not to implement it
2. There may be workarounds (using a large length value or delimiter)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - reading to EOF is common
2. The documentation explicitly promises this functionality
3. The inconsistent behavior (works with delimiter) suggests it's not intentionally blocked

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation clearly states this should work
2. The bug reproduces exactly as reported
3. This is not undefined behavior - the docs define it explicitly

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could argue the documentation is wrong and should be updated to reflect that length cannot be None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The natural interpretation is that the code should match the documentation, not vice versa
2. The TODO comment suggests the intent is to fix the code, not the docs
3. The partial implementation (works with delimiter) suggests the feature is intended
4. Changing the documentation would be a breaking change for users who rely on the documented API

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could argue this is requesting new functionality that was never properly implemented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation already describes this as existing functionality
2. This is not a request for something new, but pointing out broken existing promises
3. The partial implementation exists (with delimiter)

### Detailed Reasoning

This is clearly a **BUG**. The documentation makes an explicit contract with users that `length=None` means "read through end of file". The implementation contains an assertion that directly prevents this documented behavior.

The TODO comment is particularly revealing - it shows the developers know there's a gap between what's documented and what's implemented. The comment asks "allow length to be None and read to the end of the file?" - the answer, based on the documentation, is clearly YES.

The inconsistency where `length=None` works with a delimiter but not without makes this even more problematic. It creates a confusing API where the same parameter value has different validity based on other parameters.

This is not a case where the documentation is ambiguous or where the behavior is undefined. The documentation explicitly states what should happen, users have a reasonable expectation based on that documentation, and the code fails to meet that expectation.

### Final Decision

This should be categorized as **BUG** - a valid bug report that should be filed and fixed. The implementation should be updated to match the documented behavior, allowing `length=None` to read to end of file even when no delimiter is provided.
