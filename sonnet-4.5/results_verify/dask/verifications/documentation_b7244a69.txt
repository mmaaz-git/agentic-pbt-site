DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR format_time AND parse_timedelta

Source Code Documentation:
==========================

format_time (dask/utils.py, lines 1661-1698):
----------------------------------------------
The function has inline docstring with examples showing its output format:
- For values < 1s: Returns formatted as "X.XX us" or "X.XX ms"
- For values 1-600s: Returns "X.XX s"
- For values 601-7200s: Returns "Xm Ys" format (e.g., "20m 34s")
- For values 7201-172800s: Returns "Xhr Ym" format (e.g., "3hr 25m")
- For values > 172800s: Returns "Xd Yhr" format (e.g., "14d 6hr")

Notable: The function uses "hr" (not "h") for hours unit in multi-unit output.

parse_timedelta (dask/utils.py, lines 1838-1897):
--------------------------------------------------
The function has inline docstring stating:
- Purpose: "Parse timedelta string to number of seconds"
- Accepts: str, float, timedelta, or None
- Examples show single-unit inputs only: '3s', '3.5 seconds', '300ms'
- No examples show multi-unit inputs like "10m 1s"

The supported time units (from timedelta_sizes dict, lines 1802-1825):
- Single letters: s, m, h, d, w (NOT "hr")
- Full words: second(s), minute(s), hour(s), day(s), week(s)
- Sub-second: ms, us, ns, millisecond(s), microsecond(s), nanosecond(s)
- All units also available in uppercase

Official Dask Documentation (from docs.dask.org):
=================================================

format_time:
- Describes it as converting seconds to "human-readable string representation"
- Shows the same examples as in the code docstring
- No mention of compatibility with parse_timedelta

parse_timedelta:
- Describes it as "flexible parsing of time representations"
- Shows only single-unit examples
- No mention of ability to parse multi-unit strings
- No mention of compatibility with format_time output

Relationship Between Functions:
===============================
Neither function's documentation mentions the other. There is no documented claim that:
1. These functions should work as inverse operations
2. parse_timedelta should be able to parse format_time output
3. The functions form a round-trip pair

The documentation does NOT specify that parse_timedelta should handle multi-unit time strings like "10m 1s" or "24hr 0m" that format_time produces.

Key Finding:
===========
The incompatibility between format_time producing "hr" for hours (which parse_timedelta doesn't recognize) and multi-unit strings (which parse_timedelta cannot parse) is NOT a violation of documented behavior. Neither function claims to be compatible with the other.
