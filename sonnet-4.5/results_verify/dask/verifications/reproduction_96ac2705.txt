## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for `dask.utils.format_bytes`.

### Test Results:

1. **Direct reproduction of the reported case:**
   - Input: `n = 1125894277343089729`
   - Output: `'1000.00 PiB'`
   - Length: 11 characters
   - The value is confirmed to be less than 2**60 (1152921504606846976)
   - The assertion `len(result) <= 10` fails as expected

2. **Property-based testing:**
   - The hypothesis test confirms the bug with the same input value
   - The test failed on the first example (the known failing case)

### Code Analysis:

The actual implementation shows:
- Line 1788 of the docstring states: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
- The function uses a threshold of `k * 0.9` to decide when to use each unit
- For PiB (PebiByte), k = 2**50
- The problematic value 1125894277343089729 is approximately 0.976 * 2**50
- This triggers the PiB formatting but produces "1000.00 PiB" (11 chars)

### Bug Confirmation:

The bug is **confirmed and reproducible**. The function violates its documented contract by producing an 11-character output for a valid input that is less than 2**60. The issue occurs when values are close to but slightly less than the next unit boundary, causing them to format as "1000.00" in the current unit instead of switching to a more compact representation.
