BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Evaluation Against Each Category:

### 1. INVALID - Why it's NOT invalid:
- The bug is real and reproducible with a clear KeyError
- The code design pattern (self._dsk.update()) clearly shows intent to accumulate graphs
- The fix is straightforward and makes the code internally consistent
- This is not a case of misunderstanding the API - the code fails on legitimate usage

### 2. WONTFIX - Why it's NOT wontfix:
- This is not an obscure edge case - sequential computations are common in dask
- The error is not in some internal function but in a public profiling API
- The bug causes a crash (KeyError) not just incorrect behavior
- The fix is simple and doesn't break any existing functionality
- CacheProfiler is meant for production use, not just debugging

### 3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it's NOT a feature request:
- The code already has infrastructure (self._dsk) to handle this case
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capabilities
- The _start method already accumulates graphs, showing this was intended
- The bug prevents the profiler from working in multi-computation scenarios

### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it's NOT just a documentation issue:
- The code has a clear bug where it uses the wrong variable (dsk vs self._dsk)
- Even if docs said "doesn't support partial graphs", the code structure shows it was designed to
- The accumulation pattern in _start shows clear design intent
- This is an implementation bug, not a documentation mismatch

### 5. BUG - Why this IS a valid bug:

**Strong evidence this is a BUG:**

1. **Clear design intent violated**: The code accumulates graphs in self._dsk but doesn't use them
2. **Inconsistent implementation**: _start uses self._dsk.update() but _posttask/_finish ignore it
3. **Real-world use case**: Sequential dask computations with shared dependencies are common
4. **Simple fix available**: Changing dsk[k] to self._dsk[k] fixes the issue completely
5. **No workaround**: Users cannot work around this without modifying dask source
6. **Crash not graceful degradation**: Results in KeyError, not just incorrect metrics

## Additional Considerations:

### Why the bug exists:
Likely a simple oversight where the developer forgot that 'released' keys might come from previous computations. The pattern works fine for single computations but breaks for sequential ones.

### Impact assessment:
- **Severity**: Medium (causes crashes but only in specific multi-computation scenarios)
- **Scope**: Affects users profiling sequential computations with CacheProfiler
- **Fix risk**: Very low (simple variable substitution, maintains all existing behavior)

### Test coverage gap:
The existing tests likely only cover single computation scenarios, missing this multi-computation case.

## FINAL ASSESSMENT:

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The code has:
1. A clear design pattern (accumulating graphs)
2. An implementation that violates that pattern
3. A crash in legitimate use cases
4. A simple, low-risk fix

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, and provides both reproduction steps and a correct fix.
