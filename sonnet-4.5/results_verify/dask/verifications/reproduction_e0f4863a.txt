## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug and verified all claims made in the bug report.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Property Test**: Ran successfully with 500 examples, confirming that:
   - The function preserves tuple length (does NOT increase it)
   - The function replaces the element at the specified index
   - All other elements remain unchanged

2. **Manual Reproduction**: Confirmed the exact behavior described:
   - Input: `('a', 'b', 'c')` with `insert(tup, 1, 'X')`
   - Output: `('a', 'X', 'c')` (replacement)
   - Expected if true insert: `('a', 'X', 'b', 'c')` (insertion)
   - Length remains 3, not 4 as would be expected from insertion

3. **Python Standard Behavior Verification**:
   - Python's `list.insert(index, value)` ADDS an element and increases length
   - Example: `['a', 'b', 'c'].insert(1, 'X')` results in `['a', 'X', 'b', 'c']` with length 4
   - This is the standard Python convention for "insert" operations

4. **Docstring Example Verification**:
   - The docstring example `insert(('a', 'b', 'c'), 0, 'x')` returns `('x', 'b', 'c')`
   - This clearly shows REPLACEMENT behavior (element 'a' is replaced with 'x')
   - True insertion would produce `('x', 'a', 'b', 'c')`

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   ```python
   def insert(tup, loc, val):
       L = list(tup)
       L[loc] = val  # This is assignment/replacement, NOT insertion
       return tuple(L)
   ```
   The code uses `L[loc] = val` which is Python's list assignment operator, not `L.insert(loc, val)`.

6. **Usage in Codebase**:
   - Found ONE usage in `dask/bag/core.py` at line 2436: `insert(inp, stage - 1, j)`
   - This usage appears to expect the current replacement behavior
   - The function is imported but barely used in the codebase

### Key Finding

The function is documented (via its doctest) to perform replacement, and it does exactly what its minimal documentation shows. However, the NAME "insert" strongly violates Python conventions and user expectations. The doctest example actually demonstrates the replacement behavior correctly.

The bug report's technical analysis is 100% accurate: the function performs replacement, not insertion, despite its misleading name.
