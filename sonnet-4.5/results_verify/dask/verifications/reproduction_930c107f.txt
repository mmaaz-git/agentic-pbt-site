## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in dask.utils.format_bytes.

### Test Results

1. **Direct reproduction**: The value `1125899906842624000` produces the output `'1000.00 PiB'` which has 11 characters, not 10.

2. **Boundary testing**: I found that the bug occurs exactly when the input reaches 1000 * 2**50:
   - `999.99 * 2**50` produces `'999.99 PiB'` (10 characters) ✓
   - `1000.00 * 2**50` produces `'1000.00 PiB'` (11 characters) ✗

3. **Property-based testing**: The Hypothesis test fails with the provided examples, confirming the violation of the documented invariant.

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs because:
1. The function uses `.2f` format specifier which always shows 2 decimal places
2. When the value divided by 2**50 reaches 1000 or higher, we get a 4-digit number before the decimal point
3. The format "1000.00 PiB" has 11 characters: 4 digits + 1 decimal point + 2 decimal places + 1 space + 3 characters for "PiB"

### Verification of Precondition

The failing values ARE indeed less than 2**60:
- `1000 * 2**50 = 1125899906842624000`
- `2**60 = 1152921504606846976`
- The failing value is only 97.66% of 2**60

Therefore, the documented invariant "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters" is violated.

### Bug Report Accuracy

The bug report is technically correct:
- The code does violate the documented guarantee
- The test case correctly demonstrates the issue
- The mathematical analysis in the report is accurate
- The proposed fix would address the problem by reducing decimal places for large values
