## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence:**
- The code raises an unexpected AssertionError instead of returning a result
- Pandas handles the same operation correctly (resampling 10 hours to 1 day)
- The `@derived_from(pd_Resampler)` decorator explicitly indicates intent to match pandas behavior
- This is a common use case in time series analysis (aggregating fine-grained data to coarser frequencies)
- The error is in production code, not test assertions
- The failure prevents legitimate data processing workflows

**This appears to be the correct categorization.**

### Consideration for INVALID
**Evidence Against:**
- The code does crash with a clear error (not working as intended)
- The documentation doesn't state this limitation exists
- The use of `@derived_from` creates reasonable expectation of pandas compatibility
- No documentation suggests users should avoid this pattern

**Conclusion: NOT INVALID - This is a real issue, not user error**

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Evidence Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - resampling hourly data to daily is extremely common
- The error affects normal usage patterns (partitioned data for parallel processing)
- Many time series workflows require downsampling to coarser frequencies
- The fix appears straightforward (handle the case when target partitions < source partitions)

**Conclusion: NOT WONTFIX - This impacts common real-world usage**

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Evidence Against:**
- The code actually crashes - it's not just poorly documented behavior
- An AssertionError is not reasonable behavior even if documented
- Users shouldn't need to manually repartition before resampling
- The decorator `@derived_from(pd_Resampler)` sets clear expectations

**Conclusion: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code behavior is incorrect, not just undocumented**

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Evidence Against:**
- Resampling to coarser frequencies is core functionality, not a new feature
- Pandas already supports this, and Dask claims pandas compatibility
- The code attempts to perform the operation but fails with an assertion
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities

**Conclusion: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing existing broken functionality**

### Final Assessment
This is a **BUG**. The code fails to handle a legitimate and common use case (resampling time series data to coarser frequencies when the data is partitioned). The failure violates the documented intent of matching pandas behavior, as indicated by the `@derived_from` decorator. The AssertionError prevents normal time series workflows that should work according to both the API design and user expectations.
