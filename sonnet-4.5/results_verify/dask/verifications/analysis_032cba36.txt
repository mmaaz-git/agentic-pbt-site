## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report is demonstrably false. The function explicitly checks `if isinstance(seq, list):` and skips the `tolist()` call for lists. The exact example code provided in the bug report runs successfully without any errors. The claimed error path where `tolist()` is called on a list cannot occur due to the conditional logic. The bug report appears to be based on a misreading of the code or testing with a modified/different version.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
There's virtually no reason to consider this as anything but invalid. The reproduction code works, the implementation explicitly handles lists, and the claimed error cannot occur with the current codebase.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered WONTFIX if there was actually an issue but it was so trivial that it wasn't worth addressing. However, there is no actual issue here - the function works exactly as documented.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
WONTFIX implies acknowledging a real issue exists but choosing not to fix it. Since no issue exists at all, WONTFIX is not appropriate.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue that the comment on line 282-283 could be clearer by saying "Convert from an ndarray or other array-like object to a plain list" instead of just mentioning ndarrays. However, the docstring examples are completely accurate and work as shown.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is already correct. The docstring shows list examples that work exactly as documented. The inline comment is also technically correct - it does convert from ndarrays (and other types) to lists, it just doesn't mention that lists are passed through unchanged, which is clear from the code itself.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report's proposed "fix" of adding a `tolist` handler for lists could be seen as a feature request to make the dispatch system more complete/consistent, even though it's unnecessary for this function.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current implementation already fully supports lists without needing the proposed dispatch registration. Adding unnecessary code that would never be called is not a useful feature. The function already works exactly as intended with lists.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There is no valid reason to consider this a bug. The claimed error does not occur, the function works as documented, and the code explicitly handles the list case correctly.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Everything points to this NOT being a bug: (1) The reproduction attempt shows the function works correctly with lists, (2) The code explicitly checks for lists and handles them appropriately, (3) The docstring examples all work as shown, (4) The claimed error path is impossible given the conditional logic.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report appears to be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the code works. The reporter seems to have looked at line 287 (`seq = tolist(seq)`) without noticing the conditional logic on lines 284-285 that prevents this line from executing when the input is already a list.

The key evidence against this being a valid bug is overwhelming: The exact example code from the bug report executes successfully, proving the claimed error does not occur. The implementation explicitly includes `if isinstance(seq, list): pass` which bypasses the `tolist()` call for lists. This is not a subtle edge case or interpretation issue - it's a clear conditional that makes the reported error impossible.

Given that the bug report claims a "contract violation" between documentation and implementation, but the documentation examples work exactly as shown, and given the reporter's proposed fix would add code that would never execute (since lists never reach the `tolist()` call), this report should be closed as INVALID. The function works correctly, the documentation is accurate, and the reported issue does not exist.
