## Documentation Review for dask.utils.ndeepmap

### Function Source
The function `ndeepmap` is located in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py` at lines 302-318.

### Documentation String
The function has a minimal docstring:
```python
def ndeepmap(n, func, seq):
    """Call a function on every element within a nested container

    >>> def inc(x):
    ...     return x + 1
    >>> L = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
    >>> ndeepmap(2, inc, L)
    [[2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    """
```

### Documentation Findings

1. **No Official Public Documentation**: The function is not documented in the official Dask API documentation. It appears to be an internal utility function that is not part of the public API.

2. **Limited Docstring**: The docstring only provides:
   - A brief one-line description: "Call a function on every element within a nested container"
   - One example showing usage with n=2 on a 2-level nested list
   - No parameter descriptions
   - No explicit behavior specification for edge cases like n<=0
   - No return value description

3. **Usage in Dask**: The function is imported and used internally in:
   - `dask/array/core.py` - Used for array operations
   - `dask/utils.py` itself - Used by the deprecated `homogeneous_deepmap` function

4. **Related Function**: There's a deprecated function `homogeneous_deepmap` that internally calls `ndeepmap`, suggesting `ndeepmap` is the newer/preferred implementation.

5. **Test Coverage**: The existing test in `test_utils.py` only tests:
   - n=0 with a scalar (L=1)
   - n=0 with a single-element list (L=[1])
   - n=1, n=2, n=3 with appropriately nested lists
   - Notably, it does NOT test n=0 with multi-element lists

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No specification for n<=0 behavior**: The documentation does not specify what should happen when n is 0 or negative, especially with lists containing multiple elements.

2. **No specification of parameter constraints**: No mention of valid ranges for n, or what types seq can be.

3. **Ambiguous intent for n=0**: The test shows n=0 with L=[1] returns 2 (i.e., func(L[0])), but this behavior is not documented, and the behavior with multi-element lists is unspecified.

4. **Internal vs Public API**: The function appears to be internal (not in public docs) but is exposed in dask.utils without a leading underscore, creating ambiguity about its intended use.
