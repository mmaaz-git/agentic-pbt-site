## Documentation Analysis for sorted_division_locations

I have examined the documentation for the `sorted_division_locations` function in dask.dataframe.io.io. Here are my findings:

### Docstring Documentation
The function has a docstring that serves as the primary documentation. The docstring includes:

1. A brief description: "Find division locations and values in sorted list"

2. Multiple examples that ALL use plain Python lists as input:
   - `L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`
   - `L = ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C']`
   - `['A']` passed directly

3. Expected outputs for each example showing the function returning a tuple of (divisions, locations)

### No External Documentation Found
- The function is not documented in the main Dask DataFrame API documentation
- There is no separate documentation specifying input type requirements
- The function appears to be an internal utility function (not part of the public API)

### Implementation Details
The implementation has a comment at line 282-283:
"Convert from an ndarray to a plain list so that any divisions we extract from seq are plain Python scalars."

This comment suggests the function expects to receive numpy arrays (or similar) that need to be converted to lists, not that it expects plain lists as input.

### Key Observation
There is a clear mismatch between:
1. The docstring examples (which ALL use plain Python lists)
2. The implementation (which calls `tolist(seq)` expecting a numpy array, pandas Series, or other registered type)

The docstring is the only user-facing documentation for this function, and it explicitly shows Python lists being used as valid input in every single example.
