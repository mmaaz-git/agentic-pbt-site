REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR THE BUG REPORT

I successfully reproduced the bug using both the provided test case and the property-based test.

TEST RESULTS:

1. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - Created a DataFrame with 2 columns ('A', 'B') and 3 rows
   - Split into 2 partitions using dask
   - Called `to_bag(ddf, format='frame')`
   - EXPECTED: 2 DataFrame objects (one for each partition)
   - ACTUAL: 4 string objects: ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']

   This confirms the bug - instead of getting DataFrame objects, we get column names as strings.

2. Root Cause Analysis:
   - When iterating over a pandas DataFrame, Python yields the column names (not rows)
   - The current implementation for format='frame' directly assigns df.dask to the Bag's task graph
   - When Bag.compute() collects results, it iterates over each DataFrame partition
   - This iteration yields column names instead of preserving the DataFrame as a single object

3. Comparison with Other Formats:
   - format='tuple': Returns 3 tuples (one per row) - works correctly
   - format='dict': Returns 3 dictionaries (one per row) - works correctly
   - format='frame': Returns column names as strings - BUG

4. Property-Based Test:
   - Ran 200+ test cases with various DataFrame sizes and partition counts
   - ALL test cases failed with the same issue
   - Consistently returns 2 * npartitions strings (column names) instead of npartitions DataFrames

5. The Bug Affects All Cases:
   - Single partition: Returns 2 strings instead of 1 DataFrame
   - Multiple partitions: Returns 2*n strings instead of n DataFrames
   - Different DataFrame sizes: All exhibit the same bug

The bug is 100% reproducible and matches exactly what the bug report describes. The implementation does not match the documented behavior.
