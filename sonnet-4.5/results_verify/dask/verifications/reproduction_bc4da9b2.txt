REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION
   - The provided Hypothesis test immediately fails on the first example
   - The failure occurs with even the simplest input: [(0, 0.0, '')]
   - The error is an AssertionError showing dtype mismatch:
     * Left (original): object
     * Right (after round-trip): StringDtype(storage=pyarrow, na_value=<NA>)

2. SIMPLE EXAMPLE REPRODUCTION
   - The simple reproduction case also demonstrates the bug clearly
   - Original dtype: object
   - After round-trip: string (which is string[pyarrow])
   - The conversion happens silently with no warning

3. CONFIG INVESTIGATION
   - The default value for 'dataframe.convert-string' is None (not False)
   - When config is None (default), it behaves like True - converting object to string[pyarrow]
   - When explicitly set to False, dtypes are preserved as expected
   - When explicitly set to True, conversion occurs as with the default

4. IMPACT VERIFICATION
   The bug causes:
   - Silent dtype conversion from object to string[pyarrow]
   - Breaks round-trip property (df != from_pandas(df).compute())
   - Can break downstream code that checks for object dtype
   - No warning is issued when the conversion happens

The bug is confirmed and reproduces exactly as described in the report. The default behavior silently changes dtypes without user consent or documentation.
