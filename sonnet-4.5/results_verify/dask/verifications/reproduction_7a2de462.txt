REPRODUCTION REPORT
==================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in dask.bag.Bag.join. The issue is confirmed to be in the error handling code.

Test Results:
------------
1. Running the reproduction script provided in the bug report:
   - Expected: TypeError with message "Joined argument must be single-partition Bag, delayed object, or Iterable, got int"
   - Actual: AttributeError: type object 'int' has no attribute '_Bag__name'

2. The error occurs when passing an invalid argument type (e.g., an integer) to the join method.

3. Verification of the root cause:
   - Confirmed that `type(other).__name` (single underscore) does not exist as an attribute
   - Confirmed that `type(other).__name__` (double underscore) is the correct Python attribute
   - This is a typo in line 1203 of /dask/bag/core.py

The Bug's Effect:
----------------
When users pass an invalid type to the join() method (anything that's not an Iterable, Bag, or Delayed object), instead of receiving a helpful TypeError explaining what types are accepted, they get a confusing AttributeError about a missing '__name' attribute. This makes debugging harder as the actual validation error is masked by an implementation bug in the error message construction.

The bug is real and affects the user experience when invalid inputs are provided to the join method.
