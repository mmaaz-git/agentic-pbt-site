## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments for:**
- The function converts valid filesystem paths ("/") into invalid ones ("")
- PyArrow FileSelector accepts "/" as valid input but rejects empty strings
- The bug causes real downstream failures (FileNotFoundError)
- The behavior is objectively incorrect: "/" is universally recognized as the root directory
- The bug affects multiple inputs: "/", "///", "s3:///"
- The proposed fix is reasonable and maintains backward compatibility for normal paths

**Arguments against:**
- The function is internal/private (starts with underscore)
- No documentation exists specifying expected behavior

**Verdict:** Strong case for BUG

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- Function is private/internal, not part of public API
- No documentation specifies how edge cases should be handled
- Could argue that passing "/" to parquet operations doesn't make sense

**Arguments against:**
- The bug causes actual failures in production code
- "/" is a valid filesystem path by any reasonable standard
- The function is used internally by public APIs (read_parquet)
- Even internal functions shouldn't break on valid inputs

**Verdict:** Weak case for INVALID

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- Edge case that might rarely occur in practice (reading parquet from root directory)
- Function is internal and could be considered implementation detail
- Users shouldn't normally be passing "/" to parquet operations

**Arguments against:**
- The fix is trivial (4 lines of code)
- The bug causes actual failures, not just theoretical issues
- Other protocols like "s3:///" are also affected
- The cost of fixing is minimal compared to potential user frustration

**Verdict:** Weak case for WONTFIX

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Could frame as "add support for root directory paths"
- Function never explicitly claimed to support "/" as input

**Arguments against:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- "/" is already a valid path - it should work without special support
- The function already handles paths, just incorrectly for this edge case

**Verdict:** Very weak case for FEATURE_REQUEST

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- Function lacks any documentation
- Could document that "/" shouldn't be used

**Arguments against:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not the (non-existent) documentation
- Documenting a limitation doesn't fix the underlying bug
- PyArrow expects valid paths, and "" is not valid

**Verdict:** Very weak case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function transforms valid filesystem paths into invalid ones, causing downstream failures. The fact that "/" becomes "" is not a documentation issue or missing feature - it's incorrect behavior that breaks the contract with PyArrow's FileSelector. The bug is reproducible, has a clear fix, and affects real use cases (even if edge cases).
