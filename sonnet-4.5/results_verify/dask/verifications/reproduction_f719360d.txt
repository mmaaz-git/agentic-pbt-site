## Reproduction of Bug Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report for `dask.utils.format_bytes`.

### Bug Reproduction

The bug report states that the function's docstring claims "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters", but this constraint is violated for certain values.

**Reproduction Results:**

1. For the specific failing input `n = 1125894277343089729`:
   - Output: `'1000.00 PiB'`
   - Length: 11 characters
   - Confirmed: n < 2**60 is True

2. Additional test cases confirm the pattern:
   - `1000 * 2**50` → `'1000.00 PiB'` (11 characters)
   - `999 * 2**50` → `'999.00 PiB'` (10 characters)
   - `1001 * 2**50` → `'1001.00 PiB'` (11 characters)
   - `1100 * 2**50` → `'1100.00 PiB'` (11 characters)

3. The Hypothesis property test fails as expected:
   - The test `assert len(result) <= 10` fails for input `1125894277343089729`
   - Error message confirms: "format_bytes(1125894277343089729) = '1000.00 PiB' has length 11 > 10"

### Analysis of the Issue

The bug occurs because:
1. The function uses `.2f` formatting which always produces 2 decimal places
2. For values >= 1000 * 2**50, the formatted number is at least 7 characters (e.g., "1000.00")
3. Adding the space (1 character) and unit "PiB" (3 characters) results in 11 total characters
4. This violates the documented constraint of <= 10 characters

The bug is reproducible and the report accurately describes the issue.
