REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

Bug Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

The bug report accurately describes a real issue in the `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` function.
I have successfully reproduced the problem using both the specific test case and the hypothesis-based property tests.

Specific Test Case Results:
---------------------------
Input: divisions=[Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2000-01-01 01:00:00')]
       rule='2h', closed='left', label='left'

Output: outdivs=(Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00'))

The function returns duplicate timestamps in outdivs, which violates the expected strict monotonicity.

Hypothesis Testing Results:
---------------------------
Running 100 test cases found 25 failures where outdivs contained non-strictly-increasing values.
Common patterns:
1. When resample rule (e.g., '2D') is larger than the input time range
2. Various combinations of closed/label parameters can trigger the issue
3. The problem occurs consistently when the resampling frequency exceeds the span of input divisions

Code Analysis:
--------------
Looking at the implementation (lines 66-103), the issue occurs in the end-adjustment logic (lines 89-101):
- Line 101: `setter(outdivs, temp.index[-1])` can set the last element to be the same as previous elements
- This happens when `outdivs[-1] < divisions[-1]` but `temp.index[-1]` equals an earlier value in outdivs
- The code doesn't check for maintaining strict monotonicity when adjusting the final division

The bug manifests when:
1. The resampling frequency is larger than the input time range
2. The pandas resampling creates fewer bins than expected
3. The end adjustment tries to ensure coverage but creates duplicates

This is a genuine logic bug that violates Dask's fundamental assumption about divisions being strictly monotonic.
