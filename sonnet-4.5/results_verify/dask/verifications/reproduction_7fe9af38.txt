BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` function in dask.dataframe.tseries.resample indeed produces output divisions (outdivs) where the first element can be before the first input division, extending the time range beyond the input data boundaries.

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction
I ran the property-based test provided in the bug report:
- Test: Assert that outdivs[0] >= divisions[0] (output divisions should not start before input divisions)
- Result: FAILED with the specific example: n_divs=2, freq='h', closed='right', label='left'
- Error: "First outdiv 1999-12-31 23:00:00 before first division 2000-01-01 00:00:00"

### 2. Manual Reproduction
I ran the manual reproduction code with the failing parameters:
- Input divisions: [2000-01-01 00:00:00, 2000-01-31 00:00:00]
- Output outdivs[0]: 1999-12-31 23:00:00
- Output newdivs[0]: 2000-01-01 00:00:00
- Confirmed: outdivs[0] is 1 hour before divisions[0]

### 3. Source Code Analysis
I examined the source code at lines 66-103 of /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/tseries/resample.py:

The function contains logic to adjust newdivs[0] if it extends before the input range (lines 90-91):
```python
if newdivs[0] < divisions[0]:
    newdivs[0] = divisions[0]
```

However, there is NO corresponding adjustment for outdivs[0]. When closed='right', the code adds an offset to tempdivs (line 78), which can shift outdivs to start before the actual data range.

## Bug Impact
This is a legitimate bug because:
1. The output divisions claim data exists before the input time range begins
2. This violates the reasonable expectation that resampled data should stay within the original data boundaries
3. It can lead to incorrect time range queries and confusion about the actual time span of resampled data
4. The code already has logic to prevent newdivs from extending before divisions[0], showing this constraint was intended

## Conclusion
The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The proposed fix (adding similar constraint logic for outdivs[0]) appears correct and consistent with the existing code pattern for newdivs[0].
