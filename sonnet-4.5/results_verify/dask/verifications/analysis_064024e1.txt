## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Strong indicators this is a valid bug:**
1. Dask crashes with TypeError when using a documented, valid parameter combination
2. Pandas handles the exact same operation successfully
3. Dask aims to provide pandas API compatibility
4. The error is clearly in Dask's implementation (attempting integer division on a string)
5. The fix is straightforward - check the type before performing integer operations
6. No documentation suggests this combination shouldn't work
7. The functionality works in Dask when center=False, showing partial implementation

**This is clearly a BUG.**

### Considering INVALID:
**Why this is NOT invalid:**
1. The operation is well-defined in pandas and works correctly
2. Both window strings and center=True are documented features
3. The error is not about unsupported functionality but an implementation oversight
4. No documentation states this combination is unsupported

**Not INVALID.**

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Why this is NOT a WONTFIX:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - centering rolling windows is common in time series analysis
2. The bug affects a core DataFrame operation that users expect from pandas compatibility
3. The fix is simple and doesn't require major architectural changes
4. It's not about internal implementation details but a public API failure

**Not WONTFIX.**

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Why this is NOT a feature request:**
1. This is not asking for new functionality - pandas already supports this
2. Dask claims pandas API compatibility, so this should work
3. The functionality partially exists (works with center=False)
4. The error is a crash, not a "not implemented" message

**Not a FEATURE_REQUEST.**

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Why this is NOT a documentation issue:**
1. The documentation doesn't incorrectly describe the behavior
2. The code crashes rather than working differently than documented
3. There's no documentation suggesting this shouldn't work
4. The issue is clearly in the code implementation, not documentation

**Not a DOCUMENTATION_FIX.**

## Final Assessment:

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The code fails to handle a valid, documented parameter combination that:
- Works correctly in pandas
- Is expected to work based on Dask's pandas compatibility promise
- Has no documented restrictions
- Crashes with a clear implementation error (type mismatch)

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, includes a valid fix, and demonstrates a genuine implementation defect in Dask's rolling window functionality.
