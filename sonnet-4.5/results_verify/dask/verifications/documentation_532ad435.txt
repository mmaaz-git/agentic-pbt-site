## Documentation Analysis for dask.utils.format_bytes

The function `format_bytes` is documented both in the source code docstring and online documentation.

### Source Code Documentation (from dask/utils.py lines 1771-1799):
The function includes a docstring with:
1. A brief description: "Format bytes as text"
2. Several examples showing the conversion of byte values to human-readable formats
3. A specific claim: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

### Online Documentation:
The online documentation at docs.dask.org confirms the same constraint: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

### Key Observations:
1. The documentation makes an explicit, testable claim about the maximum output length
2. This is not a vague statement - it's a specific mathematical constraint
3. The claim is present in both the source code docstring and online documentation
4. The function uses binary prefixes (kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB) with 1024-based scaling
5. The format uses `.2f` which always produces 2 decimal places

### Implementation Details:
The function iterates through prefixes from largest to smallest (PiB down to kiB), and returns a formatted string with 2 decimal places when n >= k * 0.9, where k is the power of 2 for that prefix. For values that don't meet any threshold, it returns the raw number with " B".

The specific constraint "output is always <= 10 characters" is a concrete, verifiable property that users might rely on for formatting purposes, display layouts, or other string manipulation tasks.
