## Bug Reproduction Results

### Bug Report Claims
The bug report claims that in `dask/diagnostics/profile.py`, the `_update_pids` method has a type mismatch where it compares an integer PID with a Process object, causing the tracker process to never be filtered out.

### Verification of Technical Details

#### 1. Code Analysis
I examined the actual dask code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/diagnostics/profile.py`:

- **Line 261**: `pid = current_process()` - This indeed returns a `multiprocessing.Process` object, NOT an integer
- **Line 271**: `self._update_pids(pid)` - The Process object is passed to _update_pids
- **Line 252**: `p.pid != pid` - This compares an integer (p.pid) with a Process object (pid)

#### 2. Bug Reproduction Test
I ran the provided reproduction code and confirmed:
- `current_process()` returns a Process object of type `<class 'multiprocessing.process._MainProcess'>`
- `current_process().pid` returns an integer
- When comparing `p.pid != pid` where p.pid is an integer and pid is a Process object, the comparison ALWAYS returns True
- This means the tracker process with matching PID is never filtered out

#### 3. Impact Analysis
The bug causes:
- The tracker process itself is included in resource monitoring
- Resource measurements include the overhead of the monitoring process
- This distorts the actual resource usage being profiled

### Technical Accuracy
The bug report is technically accurate:
1. The type mismatch exists exactly as described
2. The line numbers referenced are correct
3. The consequence (tracker never filtered out) is correct
4. The proposed fix (comparing p.pid != pid.pid) would resolve the issue

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected**: A resource profiler should measure only the target code's resource usage, not including its own monitoring overhead
**Actual**: Due to the bug, the profiler includes its own resource usage in the measurements
**Documentation**: While not explicitly documented, it's reasonable to expect a profiler not to include itself in measurements
