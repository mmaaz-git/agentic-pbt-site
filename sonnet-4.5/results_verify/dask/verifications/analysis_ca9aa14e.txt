TRIAGE ANALYSIS: dask.utils.format_bytes Bug Report

CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation explicitly guarantees "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters"
   - The implementation violates this guarantee for values >= 1000 * 2^50
   - The violation occurs within the specified domain (< 2^60)
   - The contract is clear and unambiguous - using "always" means no exceptions
   - This is a testable, reproducible failure of a documented guarantee
   - The fix is straightforward and preserves functionality

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - None. This is a clear contract violation.

2. INVALID
   Arguments FOR:
   - None. The bug accurately describes a real issue.

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug is reproducible and correct
   - The documentation makes an explicit promise that is violated
   - The test cases are within the specified domain

3. WONTFIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - The edge case only occurs for extremely large values (>= 1000 PiB)
   - In practice, 1000 PiB = 1.125 exabytes, which is astronomically large
   - Most systems will never encounter such values in real usage
   - The violation is only 1 character over the limit
   - The formatting is still correct and readable

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation makes an explicit "always" guarantee with no caveats
   - The value is still within the specified domain (< 2^60)
   - Libraries should keep their documented promises
   - Some applications may depend on this guarantee for layout/formatting
   - The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - The implementation works correctly in terms of formatting bytes
   - The output is still human-readable and correct
   - We could simply update the docs to say "typically <= 10 characters"
   - Changing documentation is less risky than changing code

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The 10-character guarantee may be relied upon by existing code
   - The original intent was clearly to provide a fixed maximum width
   - The implementation can be easily fixed to honor the guarantee
   - Weakening the documentation removes a useful property

5. FEATURE_REQUEST
   Arguments FOR:
   - None. This is about existing functionality not meeting its specification.

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The function already exists with documented behavior
   - This is about fixing a bug, not adding new functionality
   - The specification is clear; it just isn't met

FINAL ASSESSMENT:

This is clearly a BUG. The function makes an explicit, unambiguous promise in its documentation
that it fails to keep. While the edge case is unlikely in practice (1000+ PiB values), the
documentation uses the word "always" which means no exceptions. The bug report is accurate,
well-documented, and provides both a failing test case and potential fixes.

The fact that this only affects extremely large values might tempt classification as WONTFIX,
but when a library makes explicit guarantees about output format constraints (likely for
formatting/display purposes), it should honor them or not make them at all.
