ANALYSIS OF BUG REPORT CATEGORIES

CONSIDERATION FOR BUG:
Arguments for:
- The function returns inconsistent types (mix of tuples and lists)
- The _array_expr version explicitly normalizes to tuples, suggesting tuples are intended
- Type consistency is a fundamental principle in programming
- The fix is simple and improves code quality

Arguments against:
- This is an internal function (underscore prefix)
- The Array constructor normalizes the output anyway
- No runtime errors occur due to this inconsistency
- No documented contract about return types

CONSIDERATION FOR INVALID:
Arguments for:
- Internal functions don't need to follow strict type consistency
- The function works correctly despite the type inconsistency
- No documentation specifies return types
- Python's duck typing philosophy allows this flexibility

Arguments against:
- The bug is real and reproducible
- Type inconsistency is generally considered poor practice
- The _array_expr version shows intent for tuple consistency

CONSIDERATION FOR WONTFIX:
Arguments for:
- This is an internal function with no public API impact
- The Array constructor handles the normalization
- No actual errors occur in practice
- The overhead of fixing this is minimal but so is the benefit
- It's been working this way without issues

Arguments against:
- The fix is trivial (one-line change)
- Consistency improves maintainability
- Could prevent future bugs if assumptions change

CONSIDERATION FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
Arguments for:
- Could document that internal functions may return mixed types
- Could add type hints to clarify expectations

Arguments against:
- Internal functions typically don't need extensive documentation
- This isn't really a documentation issue but a code consistency issue

CONSIDERATION FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
Arguments for:
- Could be viewed as requesting better type consistency

Arguments against:
- This isn't adding new functionality
- The function already exists and works

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is an internal function (_overlap_internal_chunks) that returns inconsistent types but doesn't cause runtime errors because the Array constructor normalizes the output. While type consistency is a good practice, this is an internal implementation detail that has no impact on users or the public API. The function works correctly despite the inconsistency.
