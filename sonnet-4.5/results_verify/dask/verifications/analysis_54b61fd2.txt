BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### 1. INVALID - Why this is NOT invalid:
- The bug report correctly identifies a real issue in the code
- The documentation clearly states sample controls the header sample size
- The test cases successfully demonstrate the bug
- The code inspection confirms the implementation doesn't respect sample limits when delimiter is present
- This is not a case of misunderstanding or incorrect expectations

### 2. WONTFIX - Why this is NOT wontfix:
- This is not an obscure edge case - files without delimiters are common (binary files, single-line JSON, etc.)
- The impact is severe - potential memory exhaustion and crashes
- This affects production systems working with large files
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality
- This is not a minor inconvenience but a serious resource management issue

### 3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why this is NOT a feature request:
- The sample parameter already exists and is documented to limit sample size
- Users aren't asking for new functionality, but for existing functionality to work correctly
- The documentation already promises this behavior
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new capabilities

### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why this is NOT just a documentation issue:
- The documentation correctly describes what SHOULD happen
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Changing documentation to say "sample may read entire file" would be a regression
- The documented behavior is the reasonable and expected behavior
- Users rely on sample to limit memory usage, which is its stated purpose

### 5. BUG - Why this IS a valid bug:
✓ The code violates its documented contract
✓ The behavior contradicts reasonable user expectations
✓ The issue can cause severe problems (memory exhaustion, crashes)
✓ The current behavior makes the sample parameter unreliable
✓ The fix is clear and maintains backward compatibility
✓ This affects core functionality of limiting memory usage
✓ The bug is reproducible and well-defined

## Additional Considerations

### Severity Assessment
- **HIGH SEVERITY**: Can cause production outages through memory exhaustion
- **WIDE IMPACT**: Affects any user processing files without expected delimiters
- **SECURITY IMPLICATIONS**: Could be exploited for denial of service

### User Impact
- Users explicitly using `sample` to control memory usage are affected
- Systems processing untrusted or variable input files are vulnerable
- Batch processing systems may fail unexpectedly on large files

### Fix Feasibility
- The proposed fix is reasonable and maintains functionality
- Limiting to 10x sample size provides flexibility while preventing unbounded growth
- The fix doesn't break existing valid use cases

## Final Assessment
This is a clear **BUG** that should be fixed. The code fails to honor its documented contract, can cause severe operational issues, and has a straightforward fix that maintains backward compatibility while preventing the problematic behavior.
