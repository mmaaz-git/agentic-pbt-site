## Reproduction Report for dask.bytes.read_bytes Bug

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in `dask.bytes.core.read_bytes` where the sample incorrectly includes data after the first delimiter when the entire file fits within the initial read operation.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test using Hypothesis failed as expected with the exact failing input specified in the bug report:
- `data_before=b'\x00'`
- `data_after=b'\x00'`
- `sample_size=50`

The test creates a file with content `b'\x00\n\x00'` and expects the sample to end with the delimiter `b'\n'`. The assertion failed with:
```
AssertionError: Sample must end with delimiter. Got: b'\x00\n\x00'
```

### Manual Reproduction Results
The manual test case also confirmed the bug:
- File content: `b'\x00\n\x00'`
- Returned sample: `b'\x00\n\x00'` (entire file)
- Expected sample: `b'\x00\n'` (stopping at first delimiter)
- Sample ends with delimiter: False

### Code Analysis
Examining the source code at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/bytes/core.py`, lines 173-184, reveals the logic error:

1. Line 173: Initial read into `sample_buff`
2. Lines 174-183: While loop that reads more data and checks for delimiter
3. The bug: The delimiter check (line 178) only happens on subsequent reads (`new`), not on the initial `sample_buff`
4. If the entire file fits in the initial read (line 173), the while loop never executes because the next read (line 175) returns empty, causing a break at line 177

### Impact
The bug affects the correctness of the sample when:
1. A delimiter is specified
2. Sample size is requested
3. The entire file (or the portion up to and including the first delimiter) fits within the initial sample read

This violates the expected behavior that samples should respect delimiter boundaries when delimiters are specified.
