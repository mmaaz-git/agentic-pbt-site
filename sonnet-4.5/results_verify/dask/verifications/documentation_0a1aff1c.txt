DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have examined the documentation for dask.utils.format_bytes and found the following:

1. Source Code Documentation (docstring in /dask/utils.py):
   - The function's docstring explicitly states: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
   - This is a clear, unambiguous guarantee about the output format
   - The statement appears on line 1788 of the source file
   - The docstring provides several examples but none show values >= 1000 PiB

2. Online Documentation:
   - The Dask API documentation repeats the same guarantee
   - It states: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
   - This reinforces that this is an intended feature/guarantee of the function

3. Implementation Analysis:
   - The function formats numbers with 2 decimal places (%.2f format)
   - It uses units: B, kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB
   - It does not include EiB (exbibyte) in its list of units
   - The function switches units when n >= k * 0.9 (90% of the unit threshold)
   - For PiB, it handles values from 0.9 * 2**50 up to 1024 * 2**50

4. Documentation Contract:
   - The documentation makes a specific, testable claim about string length
   - This is not a vague statement but a precise technical guarantee
   - The guarantee is violated for values >= 1000 PiB (which have 4-digit mantissas)
   - The documentation does not mention any exceptions or edge cases

Conclusion: The documentation clearly promises that outputs will be <= 10 characters for all values < 2**60. The current implementation violates this documented guarantee.
