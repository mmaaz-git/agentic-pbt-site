## Documentation Analysis

### Source Code Documentation

The function `format_bytes` is located in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py` at line 1771.

The function's docstring explicitly states:
```
"For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
```

This statement appears at line 1788 of the source code and is part of the official function documentation.

### Implementation Details

The function implementation:
1. Takes an integer `n` representing bytes
2. Iterates through size prefixes (Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, ki) with their corresponding byte values
3. For each prefix, checks if n >= k * 0.9 where k is the byte threshold
4. Returns a formatted string using f"{n / k:.2f} {prefix}B" format
5. Falls back to f"{n} B" for small values

### Documentation Claims vs Implementation

The documentation makes a specific guarantee: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

This is a contractual promise about the function's behavior. The key aspects:
1. It applies to ALL values less than 2**60 (which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes)
2. The output should ALWAYS be <= 10 characters
3. This is stated as an invariant, not a general guideline

### External Documentation

The official Dask documentation (https://docs.dask.org) confirms this same behavior and includes the same docstring with the 10-character guarantee.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly and unambiguously states that the output will be <= 10 characters for all inputs < 2**60. This is not ambiguous, conditional, or implementation-specific. It is a documented contract that users can rely upon for formatting constraints (e.g., in fixed-width displays or formatted tables).
