BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

Test Environment:
=================
- Tested with dask from /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/
- Functions tested: dask.utils.format_time and dask.utils.parse_timedelta

Bug Report Claims vs. Reality:
==============================

1. CLAIM: format_time produces multi-unit strings that parse_timedelta cannot parse
   RESULT: CONFIRMED
   - format_time(601) produces "10m 1s"
   - parse_timedelta("10m 1s") raises ValueError: could not convert string to float: '10m1'
   - format_time(86400) produces "24hr 0m"
   - parse_timedelta("24hr 0m") raises ValueError: could not convert string to float: '24hr0'

2. CLAIM: This breaks the "expected round-trip property"
   RESULT: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED (but no such property was documented)
   - Values < 600 seconds work fine (e.g., format_time(100) -> "100.00 s" -> parses to 100)
   - Values >= 601 seconds fail when format_time switches to multi-unit format
   - The hypothesis test failed on 44 out of 50 random test cases

Technical Details of Failure:
=============================

The parse_timedelta function:
1. Removes all spaces from input: "10m 1s" becomes "10m1s"
2. Finds the last alphabetic sequence as the unit: "s"
3. Tries to parse the prefix "10m1" as a float, which fails

Additional Issues Found:
========================

1. Unit mismatch: format_time uses "hr" for hours, but parse_timedelta only recognizes "h" or "hour(s)"
   - parse_timedelta("1hr") fails with KeyError
   - parse_timedelta("1h") works fine

2. The parsing algorithm in parse_timedelta is fundamentally incompatible with multi-unit strings:
   - It expects format: [number][unit]
   - Cannot handle: [number][unit][number][unit]

Boundary Testing:
================
- format_time(600) = "600.00 s" - PARSES OK
- format_time(601) = "10m 1s" - FAILS TO PARSE
- format_time(7200) = "120m 0s" - FAILS TO PARSE
- format_time(7201) = "2hr 0m" - FAILS TO PARSE
- format_time(172800) = "48hr 0m" - FAILS TO PARSE
- format_time(172801) = "2d 0hr" - FAILS TO PARSE

Conclusion:
===========
The technical details in the bug report are accurate. The functions are indeed incompatible for values >= 601 seconds due to:
1. Multi-unit format output that parse_timedelta cannot handle
2. Use of "hr" unit that parse_timedelta doesn't recognize
