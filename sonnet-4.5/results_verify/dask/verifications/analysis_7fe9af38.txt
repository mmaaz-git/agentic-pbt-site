BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The bug is reproducible and demonstrates incorrect behavior
- Output divisions extend before input divisions, violating data boundary expectations
- The code already has partial logic to prevent this (for newdivs) but fails to apply it consistently (for outdivs)
- Divisions are documented to represent actual data boundaries, not hypothetical ranges
- The inconsistency between newdivs and outdivs handling suggests an implementation oversight
- This can cause real issues in production: incorrect time range queries, confusion about data spans

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is internal/private (underscore prefix), so behavior might be intentionally flexible
- No explicit documentation states this specific constraint

**Assessment: STRONG case for BUG**

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is internal and undocumented, so any behavior could be considered valid
- Maybe extending divisions beyond data boundaries is intentional for some edge cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug violates the general principle of divisions representing actual data boundaries
- The code already constrains newdivs[0], showing the intent to maintain boundaries
- The behavior is clearly problematic and can cause downstream issues

**Assessment: WEAK case for INVALID**

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be considered an obscure edge case (specific combination of closed='right', label='left')
- Internal function that users shouldn't directly call

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This affects the public resample() API indirectly
- Not that obscure - these are valid parameter combinations
- Can cause real data integrity issues
- Easy fix available that matches existing code pattern

**Assessment: WEAK case for WONTFIX**

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame as "Add boundary constraint checking for outdivs"
- The current code doesn't explicitly handle this case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The constraint already exists for newdivs, just incompletely implemented
- Users expect divisions to respect data boundaries

**Assessment: VERY WEAK case for FEATURE_REQUEST**

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that divisions may extend beyond data boundaries in some cases
- The function lacks documentation entirely

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior is incorrect, not just poorly documented
- Fixing documentation to say "divisions can be wrong" is not helpful
- The code intent (seen in newdivs handling) shows this should be fixed in code

**Assessment: VERY WEAK case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX**

## Conclusion

This is clearly a BUG. The evidence strongly supports this classification:

1. **Reproducible incorrect behavior**: Output divisions extend before input data boundaries
2. **Violates documented principles**: Divisions should represent actual data boundaries
3. **Inconsistent implementation**: newdivs is constrained but outdivs is not
4. **Real impact**: Can cause incorrect query results and data confusion
5. **Clear fix available**: The proposed fix follows the existing code pattern

The fact that the code already constrains newdivs[0] but fails to constrain outdivs[0] strongly suggests this is an implementation oversight rather than intentional behavior. This is a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
