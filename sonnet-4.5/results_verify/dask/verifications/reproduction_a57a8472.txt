REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for dask.array.argtopk.

Bug Confirmation:
-----------------
The bug occurs exactly as described in the report. When calling da.argtopk with k equal to or greater than the array size on an array with multiple chunks, the function crashes with:
"ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)"

Reproduction Steps:
-------------------
1. Created test array: np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=np.int32)
2. Created dask array with multiple chunks: da.from_array(arr, chunks=2)
3. Called da.argtopk(arr, 5).compute()
4. Result: ValueError at dask/array/chunk.py:245 in argtopk_aggregate

Test Results:
-------------
- FAILS: k=5 (equal to array size) with chunks=2 - ValueError
- WORKS: k=5 with chunks=5 (single chunk) - Returns [4 3 2 1 0]
- WORKS: k=3 (less than array size) with chunks=2 - Returns [4 3 2]
- FAILS: k=-5 with chunks=2 - Same ValueError
- WORKS: k=-5 with chunks=5 (single chunk) - Returns [1 2 0 4 3]

Property-based testing confirmed multiple failing cases:
- All cases where k equals array size and array has multiple chunks fail
- Found 12+ distinct failing examples in 50 test runs

Root Cause Analysis:
--------------------
The bug is in the argtopk function in dask/array/chunk.py at line 229:

```python
if abs(k) >= a.shape[axis]:
    return a_plus_idx  # BUG HERE
```

When k >= array size:
- With single chunk: a_plus_idx is a tuple (a, idx), so return works correctly
- With multiple chunks: a_plus_idx is a list of tuples after aggregation
- The caller at line 245 always expects to unpack exactly 2 values: a, idx = argtopk(...)
- Returning a list causes "too many values to unpack" error

The fix suggested in the bug report is correct:
- Should return (a, idx) consistently, not the raw a_plus_idx
- The variables a and idx are already computed at this point in the function

Expected Behavior:
------------------
When k equals the array size, argtopk should return all indices sorted by their corresponding values, similar to np.argsort. This is a valid use case and works correctly with single chunks but fails with multiple chunks due to the implementation bug.
