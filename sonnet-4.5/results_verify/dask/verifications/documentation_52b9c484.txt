DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR _aggregate_columns FUNCTION
======================================================

Function Location: dask.dataframe.dask_expr.io.parquet._aggregate_columns

Documentation Status:
- The function has NO docstring or comments explaining its purpose or expected behavior
- The function name starts with underscore (_), indicating it is an INTERNAL/PRIVATE function
- No public API documentation exists for this function (confirmed by searching Dask's public documentation)
- The function is not exposed in the public API

Function Usage Context:
- Used internally within parquet.py for aggregating column statistics
- Called via partial application in two places:
  1. Line 1972: In _aggregate_statistics_to_file() function
  2. Line 2024: In _combine_stats() function
- Both usages pass it as an aggregation function for the "columns" key

Function Implementation:
- Takes two parameters: cols (list) and agg_cols (dict)
- Uses a while True loop that relies on IndexError to break
- Appears to transpose a list of column lists (cols) and then aggregate them

Expected Behavior (inferred from code):
- Should take a list of lists (cols) where each inner list represents column data
- Should transpose these columns (i.e., convert [[a1,a2],[b1,b2]] to [[a1,b1],[a2,b2]])
- Should then apply aggregation functions from agg_cols to each transposed group
- Returns aggregated dictionaries for each column position

Empty List Handling:
- NO DOCUMENTATION specifies what should happen with an empty list input
- The function is internal/private, so there's no contract about edge cases
- Based on the implementation pattern, it appears the developer assumed cols would never be empty
- The function's logic expects at least one column to trigger the IndexError

Conclusion:
This is an undocumented internal function with no specification for how it should handle edge cases like empty lists. The lack of documentation means there's no clear contract about whether empty list handling is required or if this is considered an invalid input for an internal function.
