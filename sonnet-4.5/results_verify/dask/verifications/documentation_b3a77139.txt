DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR dask.utils.key_split
================================================

The key_split function is documented primarily through its docstring in the source code at dask/utils.py lines 1949-1976. There is no comprehensive external documentation found in the Dask documentation website.

DOCSTRING DOCUMENTATION:
The function includes extensive docstring examples that demonstrate expected behavior:
- Basic splitting: 'x-1' returns 'x' (strips numeric suffixes)
- Multi-part keys: 'x-1-2-3' returns 'x' (strips all numeric parts)
- Tuple handling: ('x-2', 1) returns 'x'
- Multi-word preservation: 'hello-world-1' returns 'hello-world' (keeps alphabetic parts)
- Hash detection: 32-character hex strings return 'data'
- Hex suffix handling: 'x-abcdefab' returns 'x' with comment "# ignores hex"

The critical documentation point is line 1972:
>>> key_split('x-abcdefab')  # ignores hex
'x'

This example shows that 8-character sequences that could be hexadecimal (containing only a-f characters) should be stripped from the key. However, the documentation does NOT explicitly state:
1. What constitutes "hex" - is it just [a-f] or full hexadecimal [0-9a-f]?
2. Whether mixed hex strings (containing both digits and letters) should be stripped
3. The specific length requirement (8 characters) for hex detection

The comment "# ignores hex" is ambiguous because:
- In common usage, hexadecimal includes digits 0-9 and letters a-f
- The example only shows a pattern with letters (abcdefab)
- No counter-example is provided with digits

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FROM CODE:
The code shows two different regex patterns:
1. Line 1944: hex_pattern = re.compile("[a-f]+") - only matches lowercase letters a-f
2. Line 1995: re.match(r"[a-f0-9]{32}", result) - matches full hex including digits

This inconsistency suggests potential confusion about the intended behavior.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is incomplete and potentially misleading. It doesn't clearly specify what types of 8-character suffixes should be stripped, and the single example provided doesn't cover the full range of hexadecimal patterns. The comment "ignores hex" could reasonably be interpreted to mean all hexadecimal strings (including digits), not just those containing only letters a-f.
