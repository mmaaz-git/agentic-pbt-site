REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the bug report. Here's what I found:

1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction:
   - The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report correctly identifies the issue
   - When running the test with values between 0 and 2**60, it fails on value 1125894277343089729
   - This value produces the output '1000.00 PiB' which has 11 characters, violating the <= 10 character constraint

2. Manual Test Reproduction:
   - The specific failing example n=1125899906842624000 produces '1000.00 PiB' with length 11
   - The bug occurs for any value that formats as >= 1000.00 PiB (4-digit mantissa)
   - All test cases in the bug report are accurate:
     * 999 PiB produces '999.00 PiB' (10 chars) - PASSES
     * 1000 PiB produces '1000.00 PiB' (11 chars) - FAILS
     * 1023 PiB produces '1023.00 PiB' (11 chars) - FAILS

3. Verification of Constraints:
   - Confirmed that 1125899906842624000 < 2**60 (which is 1152921504606846976)
   - The bug affects all values from approximately 1000 PiB to 1024 PiB
   - These values are all less than 2**60 but produce 11-character outputs

The bug is consistently reproducible and the bug report accurately describes the issue.
