BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible triage category:

1. INVALID (incorrect bug report)
   --------------------------------
   Why it might be INVALID:
   - None applicable

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The function's docstring explicitly shows bytes input: key_split(b'hello-world-1')
   - The function has explicit handling for bytes type: "if type(s) is bytes"
   - The crash is real and reproducible
   - Bytes are clearly meant to be a supported input type

   Verdict: NOT INVALID - the bug report is correct

2. WONTFIX (trivial/uninteresting)
   ---------------------------------
   Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - Non-UTF-8 bytes in Dask task keys might be extremely rare
   - The function is primarily internal for visualization

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - The function is publicly exposed via dask.widgets.FILTERS
   - Crashes are not trivial - they break user code
   - The fix is simple and straightforward
   - Property-based testing found this issue, suggesting it's a real edge case

   Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - crashes are significant issues

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (new functionality)
   -------------------------------------
   Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Handling non-UTF-8 bytes could be seen as a new feature

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The function already claims to support bytes (per docstring)
   - This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new
   - The type checking shows bytes were always intended to work

   Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - this is fixing broken existing functionality

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (docs are wrong)
   ------------------------------------
   Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation could be updated to say "only UTF-8 bytes supported"
   - The example could be removed from the docstring

   Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code explicitly handles bytes as a special case
   - The intent was clearly to support bytes input
   - Changing docs to exclude bytes would be a regression
   - The implementation is wrong, not the documentation

   Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the code should match the documented behavior

5. BUG (valid bug report)
   ------------------------
   Why it IS a BUG:
   - The function crashes on valid Python bytes objects
   - The docstring explicitly shows bytes as supported input
   - The code has explicit handling for bytes type
   - The crash is unhandled (UnicodeDecodeError)
   - The fix is straightforward (add error='replace' or similar)
   - This breaks the contract established by the documentation

   Why it might NOT be a BUG:
   - None - all evidence points to this being a legitimate bug

   Verdict: This IS A BUG

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
-----------------
This is a clear BUG. The function's documentation explicitly supports bytes input, the code has special handling for bytes, but it crashes on non-UTF-8 bytes due to missing error handling in the decode() call. The suggested fix (using errors='replace' or errors='ignore') is appropriate and would make the function robust to all bytes input as the documentation suggests it should be.
