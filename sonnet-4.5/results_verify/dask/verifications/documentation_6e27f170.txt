## Documentation Analysis

### Documentation Sources Reviewed

1. **Function Docstring** (dask/utils.py, line 1788):
   - States: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."
   - This is an explicit contract/guarantee about the output format

2. **Official Dask Documentation**:
   - The online documentation at docs.dask.org mirrors the docstring
   - The same guarantee is repeated: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

### Documentation Intent

The documentation makes a clear, unambiguous claim about the output length constraint. This appears to be an intentional design decision to ensure consistent formatting width, likely for display purposes in tables or logs where column width matters.

### What the Documentation Specifies

1. The function formats bytes into human-readable strings
2. It uses binary prefixes (kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB)
3. It provides several examples showing the format
4. It makes an explicit guarantee: for inputs < 2**60, output length <= 10 characters

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify

The documentation does not:
- Explain WHY the 10-character limit exists
- Specify what happens for values >= 2**60
- Indicate that this is a "best effort" or approximate constraint
- Provide any exceptions or caveats to this rule

### Analysis

The documentation presents this as a hard constraint, not a guideline or approximation. The phrasing "is always <= 10 characters" is definitive and leaves no room for exceptions. This is not a case where the documentation is ambiguous or where the behavior is undefined.

The function's actual behavior (producing 11-character outputs for certain valid inputs < 2**60) directly contradicts the documented guarantee. This is not a case of unspecified behavior or missing documentation - it's a case where the documentation makes a specific claim that the implementation fails to satisfy.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly and explicitly promises a behavior (10-character maximum output for values < 2**60) that the implementation does not deliver. This is either:
1. A bug in the implementation (it should honor the documented constraint)
2. A bug in the documentation (the constraint should be updated to reflect reality)
