## Documentation Analysis for _read_orc Function

### Official Dask Documentation
The official Dask documentation for `read_orc` describes the `columns` parameter as:
- Type: "None or list(str)"
- Purpose: "Columns to load. If None, loads all."

This description suggests that `columns` is an input parameter used to specify which columns to read from the ORC file. There is no indication in the documentation that this parameter should or would be modified during execution.

### Function Signature and Docstring
Looking at the actual source code in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/io/orc/core.py`:
- The public `read_orc` function (line 32-108) has a docstring that matches the online documentation
- The internal `_read_orc` function (line 111-123) has no docstring at all
- The `_read_orc` function is an internal/private function (prefixed with underscore)

### Python Conventions
- PEP 8 does not provide explicit guidance on mutating function arguments
- General Python convention and best practices discourage mutating input arguments unless:
  1. The mutation is the explicit purpose of the function
  2. The function is clearly documented to mutate its inputs
  3. The function name suggests mutation (e.g., `list.append()`, `dict.update()`)

### Dask Coding Conventions
The Dask development documentation does not explicitly address whether functions should mutate their input arguments. There is no specific guidance found in their coding conventions.

### Key Observation
The `_read_orc` function is an internal/private function (indicated by the leading underscore). However, even for internal functions, unexpected mutations can cause issues, especially when the function is called from other parts of the codebase that may reuse the same list object.

### Conclusion from Documentation
There is no documentation that suggests the `columns` parameter should be mutated. The documentation describes it as a selection parameter, not a mutable working list. The lack of any mention of mutation in the documentation suggests that mutation is not an intended behavior.
