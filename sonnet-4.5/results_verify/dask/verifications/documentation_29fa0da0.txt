# Documentation Analysis for dask.bag.from_sequence

## Documentation Review

### From Source Code Docstring (lines 1762-1788):
```python
def from_sequence(seq, partition_size=None, npartitions=None):
    """Create a dask Bag from Python sequence.

    This sequence should be relatively small in memory.  Dask Bag works
    best when it handles loading your data itself.  Commonly we load a
    sequence of filenames into a Bag and then use ``.map`` to open them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq: Iterable
        A sequence of elements to put into the dask
    partition_size: int (optional)
        The length of each partition
    npartitions: int (optional)
        The number of desired partitions

    It is best to provide either ``partition_size`` or ``npartitions``
    (though not both.)
    """
```

### From Official Dask Documentation:
- The parameter is described as "The number of desired partitions"
- Documentation recommends providing either partition_size or npartitions (not both)
- Examples show usage like `db.from_sequence([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], npartitions=2)`

## Key Observations:

1. **Language Used**: The documentation uses the word "desired" rather than "guaranteed" or "exact" when describing npartitions. This is somewhat ambiguous.

2. **No Explicit Contract**: The documentation does NOT explicitly state that the function will create exactly `npartitions` partitions. It only says "desired partitions".

3. **Best Practices Note**: The documentation says "It is best to provide either partition_size or npartitions" but doesn't explain what happens if the desired number can't be achieved.

4. **No Warning About Edge Cases**: The documentation doesn't warn users that the actual number of partitions might differ from the requested value.

## Documentation vs Implementation Gap:

The documentation is ambiguous about the actual behavior:
- Users would reasonably expect that specifying `npartitions=3` would create 3 partitions
- The word "desired" could be interpreted as either:
  - A target that will be met (user expectation)
  - A hint that may be approximated (current implementation)

## Related Function Comparison:

Looking at `bag_range` (lines 1955-1975), which also takes an `npartitions` parameter, it DOES guarantee exactly `npartitions` partitions by adjusting the last partition size if needed. This inconsistency suggests that users would expect similar behavior from `from_sequence`.

## Conclusion:

The documentation is insufficiently clear about the actual behavior of the `npartitions` parameter. While it doesn't explicitly promise exact partition counts, the lack of any warning about potential mismatches, combined with the parameter name ("npartitions" not "target_npartitions" or "approximate_npartitions") and comparison with similar functions, would lead reasonable users to expect the specified number of partitions to be created.
