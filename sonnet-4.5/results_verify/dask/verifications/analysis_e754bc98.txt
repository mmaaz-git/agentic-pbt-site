## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The function's own docstring explicitly shows 5 different examples using plain Python lists
- The docstring says "Find division locations and values in sorted list" (emphasis on "list")
- The examples are not marked as pseudocode or conceptual - they're formatted as executable doctests
- The error is not about incorrect usage but a missing dispatcher implementation

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
This is clearly valid - the documentation establishes the contract, and the implementation violates it.

### Considering WONTFIX

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- The function appears to be semi-internal (not in public API docs)
- Existing tests only use pandas/numpy objects, suggesting lists were never truly intended to work
- Users can easily work around by converting lists to numpy arrays first

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The docstring examples are the primary documentation for this function
- The fix is trivial (3 lines of code to register list dispatcher)
- The function comment at line 282-283 explicitly mentions converting to "plain list" internally
- Breaking docstring examples is not a trivial issue

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Strong arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The implementation consistently uses pandas/numpy types throughout the codebase
- All actual tests use pandas Series, not lists
- The function might have originally supported lists but was refactored to use the dispatcher pattern
- Fixing the docs (changing examples to use numpy arrays) is simpler than changing code

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The docstring examples are very deliberate and extensive (5 examples)
- The internal comment says "Convert from an ndarray to a plain list" suggesting lists are intended
- Users encountering this function will naturally try the docstring examples first

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting plain lists could be seen as a new feature if the function was never meant to support them
- The dispatcher pattern suggests deliberate type restrictions

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The docstring examples aren't requesting new functionality - they're showing existing (documented) functionality
- This isn't an enhancement but restoring documented behavior

### Considering BUG

**Strong arguments for BUG:**
- Clear contract violation: docstring shows list examples, implementation rejects lists
- The error message "No dispatch for <class 'list'>" indicates missing functionality, not intentional restriction
- The fix is trivial and matches the documented behavior
- The function's purpose ("Find division locations and values in sorted list") suggests lists should work
- Comment at line 282-283 shows awareness of plain lists as a concept

**Arguments against BUG:**
- Could be stale documentation from an earlier version

### Conclusion

This is most appropriately classified as either:
1. **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** - Update the docstring to use numpy arrays/pandas Series
2. **BUG** - Add the missing list dispatcher to match documented behavior

Given that:
- The docstring is the primary documentation
- All 5 examples consistently use lists
- The fix is trivial (3 lines)
- The function description mentions "sorted list"

This should be classified as **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** because:
1. The actual usage pattern in the codebase (tests, other modules) consistently uses pandas/numpy types
2. The dispatcher pattern was clearly designed for array-like objects, not plain lists
3. Changing documentation is less risky than changing behavior
4. The function is semi-internal and not part of the public API
