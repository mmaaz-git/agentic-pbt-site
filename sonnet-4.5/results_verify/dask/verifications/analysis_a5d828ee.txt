## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This would be INVALID if the function was never intended to accept Python lists, and the docstring examples were just theoretical or pseudocode. However, the docstring examples are formatted as executable Python code with the >>> prompt, clearly indicating they should be runnable. Additionally, the function's purpose (processing sorted sequences) makes accepting Python lists a natural requirement.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The docstring explicitly shows multiple examples using Python lists as input with expected output values. These are not abstract examples but concrete, executable code snippets. The function crashes on exactly the inputs shown in its own documentation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue this is WONTFIX if users should always use numpy arrays or pandas objects with Dask, and Python lists are considered too trivial for a data processing library focused on larger-than-memory computations. The fix is also trivial (adding a simple identity function for lists).

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The examples in the official documentation use Python lists, making this a core part of the function's documented API. Users following the documentation will immediately encounter this error. This is not an edge case but the primary example shown to users learning the function.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This could be a DOCUMENTATION_FIX if the function was never meant to accept Python lists, and the documentation examples should have used numpy arrays instead. The fix would be to update all docstring examples to use `np.array(['A', 'B', 'C', ...])` instead of plain Python lists.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The comment in the code (line 282-283) explicitly mentions converting TO a plain list for internal processing, suggesting lists are the intended internal format. The function's logic doesn't require array-specific operations that would preclude list support. Supporting lists appears to be the original intent, not a documentation error.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could frame this as a FEATURE_REQUEST to add support for Python lists, arguing that the current implementation only supports numpy/pandas objects and adding list support would be a new feature. The docstring examples could be seen as aspirational rather than functional.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The docstring examples aren't presented as future functionality but as current, working examples. The >>> prompt convention in Python documentation indicates executable code. This isn't adding new functionality but fixing broken existing documentation examples.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function's own documentation shows it accepting Python lists, but it crashes when given Python lists. This is a clear disconnect between documented behavior and actual behavior. The fix is straightforward - adding a dispatch handler for lists that returns the list unchanged. The error prevents users from running the primary examples in the documentation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if Dask has a general policy of not supporting Python lists in favor of numpy/pandas objects, but this isn't documented anywhere, and the function's own examples contradict this.

## Overall Consideration

This is unambiguously a BUG. The function's docstring contains multiple examples using Python lists as input, formatted as executable Python code with the >>> prompt. These examples crash with a TypeError when executed. This is not a case of ambiguous documentation or undefined behavior - the documentation explicitly shows the function accepting Python lists and returning specific outputs.

The technical cause is clear: the `tolist` dispatch system lacks a handler for Python's built-in list type. The irony is that `tolist` is meant to convert things TO lists, but it can't handle an input that's already a list. The fix is trivial - adding an identity function for lists to the dispatch registry.

While one could argue users should use numpy arrays with Dask, the documentation doesn't state this requirement, and instead shows Python lists in its primary examples. A user following the documentation will immediately encounter this error. This makes it a clear bug in the implementation, not a documentation issue or missing feature.
