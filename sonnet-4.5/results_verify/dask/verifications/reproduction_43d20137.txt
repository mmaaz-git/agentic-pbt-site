BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

Test Results:
-------------
1. **Bug Exists**: Confirmed - the code crashes with KeyError when state dict is missing required keys

2. **Exact Reproduction**: Successfully reproduced the exact scenario from bug report:
   - State dict with {"finished": [...], "waiting": [], "running": []} (missing "ready")
   - Results in: KeyError: 'ready' at line 137 of progress.py

3. **Additional Test Cases Confirmed**:
   - Missing "finished" key → KeyError: 'finished' (line 136)
   - Missing "ready" key → KeyError: 'ready' (line 137)
   - Missing multiple keys → KeyError on first access

4. **Existing Defensive Code Works For**:
   - Empty dict {} → Handled properly (returns early at line 134)
   - None state → Handled properly (returns early at line 134)

5. **Normal Operation Works**:
   - Complete state dict with all four keys works correctly
   - No errors when all expected keys are present

Technical Details:
------------------
The crash occurs at lines 136-137:
```python
ndone = len(s["finished"])  # Line 136 - direct dict access
ntasks = sum(len(s[k]) for k in ["ready", "waiting", "running"]) + ndone  # Line 137
```

The code uses direct dictionary key access (s["finished"] and s[k]) which raises KeyError if the key doesn't exist.

Proposed Fix Verification:
--------------------------
The proposed fix using .get(key, []) instead of direct access was tested and confirmed to work:
- All incomplete state dictionaries handled gracefully
- No functionality change for complete state dictionaries
- Maintains existing behavior for None/empty states

User's Claim:
-------------
The bug report correctly identifies that:
1. The method crashes with incomplete state dictionaries
2. There's already defensive code for empty states (line 133)
3. The fix using .get() resolves the issue

However, the report doesn't acknowledge this is a PRIVATE method not meant for direct user access.
