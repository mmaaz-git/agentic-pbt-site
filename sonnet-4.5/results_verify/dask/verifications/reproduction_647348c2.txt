BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in dask.bytes.core.read_bytes function.

## Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test provided in the bug report correctly identifies the issue. When run with the failing input (size=2, blocksize=1, not_zero=True), the test fails with:
"Offsets not increasing at index 1: off=[1, 1], size=2, blocksize=1, not_zero=True"

## Specific Example Reproduction
The specific failing example from the bug report produces exactly the described output:
- Input: size=2, blocksize=1, not_zero=True
- Result: off = [1, 1]
- Issue: off[0] = 1 and off[1] = 1 (duplicate offsets)

## Extended Testing
Testing with various small file sizes confirmed the bug occurs in multiple scenarios:
- size=2, blocksize=1, not_zero=True => off=[1, 1] ✗ BUG
- size=3, blocksize=1, not_zero=True => off=[1, 1, 2] ✗ BUG

The pattern shows that when:
1. The file size is small relative to blocksize
2. The initial offset list has off[1] = 1
3. not_zero=True is set

Then setting off[0] = 1 creates a duplicate offset, violating the invariant that offsets should be strictly increasing.

## Code Analysis
Examining the actual dask code at lines 139-141 in /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/bytes/core.py confirms:
```python
if not_zero:
    off[0] = 1
    length[0] -= 1
```

This code unconditionally sets off[0] = 1 when not_zero=True, without checking if this creates a duplicate with off[1].

## Impact
The bug results in duplicate offsets which would cause:
1. Two blocks starting at the same position in the file
2. Potential data duplication or missing data when reading blocks
3. Violation of the fundamental assumption that blocks are non-overlapping

The bug is real, reproducible, and affects the correctness of the read_bytes function.
