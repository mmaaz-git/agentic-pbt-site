## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering: BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments for:**
1. The code demonstrates a clear inconsistency - column statistics sometimes have a 'name' field and sometimes don't
2. Downstream code (`sorted_columns`) unconditionally accesses the 'name' field, causing crashes
3. The bug is reproducible and affects real-world scenarios (columns with uniform values and nulls)
4. The fix is straightforward and maintains backward compatibility
5. The current behavior breaks the implicit contract between producer and consumer functions

**Arguments against:**
1. `_aggregate_stats` is an internal function (underscore prefix), not public API
2. The comment suggests intentional removal of "dangerous" stats

**Verdict:** STRONG case for BUG

### Considering: INVALID
**Arguments for:**
1. The function is internal and may not have guaranteed behavior
2. Perhaps the intent is to signal invalid statistics by omitting fields

**Arguments against:**
1. The bug causes actual crashes in downstream code
2. The inconsistent structure violates the principle of least surprise
3. Other parts of the codebase clearly expect 'name' to always be present

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID - the crash is real and affects functionality

### Considering: WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
1. Edge case that only occurs with specific data patterns (min==max with nulls)
2. Internal implementation detail not exposed to users directly

**Arguments against:**
1. The bug can occur with common data patterns (e.g., categorical columns with nulls)
2. Causes actual crashes that users would encounter
3. Fix is trivial (just add the 'name' field)
4. Not fixing it leaves a landmine in the codebase

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX - the impact is significant and fix is simple

### Considering: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
1. Could be viewed as requesting better handling of edge cases

**Arguments against:**
1. This is clearly a bug - the code crashes with KeyError
2. Not a request for new functionality, but fixing broken existing functionality
3. The consumer code already expects this field to exist

**Verdict:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - this is fixing broken code, not adding features

### Considering: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
1. No formal documentation specifies the column statistics format
2. Could document that 'name' field may be missing in some cases

**Arguments against:**
1. The code crashes - this isn't just a documentation issue
2. The consumer code's expectations are clear from its implementation
3. Documenting the bug doesn't fix the actual problem
4. The inconsistency appears unintentional based on code structure

**Verdict:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the code needs fixing, not just documentation

### Final Analysis
This is clearly a **BUG**. The `_aggregate_stats` function produces inconsistent output that causes crashes in downstream code. The fact that it's an internal function doesn't excuse the inconsistency - internal functions should still maintain contracts with their consumers within the same codebase. The fix is simple, correct, and maintains the intended behavior of filtering out unreliable min/max statistics while preserving the required metadata structure.
