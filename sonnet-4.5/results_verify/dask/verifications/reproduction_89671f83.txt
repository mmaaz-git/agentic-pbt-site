# Bug Reproduction Analysis

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and consistent with what was reported.

## Reproduction Steps and Results

### 1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The property-based test failed exactly as described in the bug report:
- Failing input: `data=[0, 0], write_index=True`
- The test expects round-trip preservation when `write_index=True` but the index is lost
- AssertionError shows the index values are different (50% mismatch)
- Expected index: [0, 1]
- Actual index: [0, 0]

### 2. Manual Test Reproduction
Running the manual reproduction code confirmed the bug:
- Original DataFrame has index [0, 1]
- After ORC round-trip, the index becomes [0, 0]
- The index values are reset to default sequential values starting from 0

### 3. Further Investigation
I conducted additional tests to understand the issue:

When using a custom index (e.g., [100, 200]):
- The index IS written to the ORC file as a column named `__index_level_0__`
- When reading back with `read_orc()` without parameters, this column appears as a regular data column
- The DataFrame gets a default RangeIndex instead of using the saved index values
- When explicitly specifying `index='__index_level_0__'` in `read_orc()`, the index is correctly restored

### 4. Comparison with Parquet
To understand if this is expected behavior, I compared with Parquet format:
- Parquet DOES preserve the index automatically in round-trips
- Writing with `write_index=True` and reading with `read_parquet()` correctly restores the index
- This shows an inconsistency between ORC and Parquet handling in Dask

## Conclusion
The bug is confirmed. When using `to_orc(write_index=True)` followed by `read_orc()` without explicitly specifying the index parameter, the index information is not automatically restored, despite being present in the file. This breaks the expected round-trip property and is inconsistent with how Parquet format works in Dask.
