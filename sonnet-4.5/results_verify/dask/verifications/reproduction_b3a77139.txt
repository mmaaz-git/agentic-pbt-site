BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

SUMMARY:
The bug report claims that key_split fails to strip 8-character hexadecimal suffixes containing digits. However, testing shows the function DOES strip these suffixes correctly, though not for the reason stated in the bug report.

TEST RESULTS:

1. BASIC ASSERTIONS FROM BUG REPORT:
   - key_split('task-abcdefab') == 'task' ✓ PASSES
   - key_split('task-12345678') == 'task' ✓ PASSES

The bug report claimed the second assertion would fail, but it actually passes.

2. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
   All test cases with 8-character suffixes returned the base word correctly:
   - 'x-abcdefab' → 'x' ✓ (all letters)
   - 'x-12345678' → 'x' ✓ (all digits)
   - 'x-1234abcd' → 'x' ✓ (mixed)
   - 'x-abcd1234' → 'x' ✓ (mixed)
   - 'x-00000000' → 'x' ✓ (all zeros)
   - 'x-ffffffff' → 'x' ✓ (all f's)
   - 'x-deadbeef' → 'x' ✓ (classic hex)

3. PROPERTY-BASED TESTING:
   The Hypothesis test with 50 random examples PASSED completely. No failures were found.

4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   The function strips 8-character suffixes through TWO different mechanisms:

   a) For suffixes containing digits (like '12345678'):
      - They fail the isalpha() test
      - The loop breaks immediately, excluding them from the result

   b) For pure alphabetic hex patterns (like 'abcdefab'):
      - They pass isalpha() but match the hex_pattern regex
      - The condition (len==8 AND hex_match) causes the loop to break

THE BUG REPORT'S ERROR:
The reporter incorrectly diagnosed the cause. They assumed the regex pattern [a-f]+ was responsible for handling ALL 8-character hex suffixes. In reality:
- The regex only handles pure alphabetic patterns
- Patterns with digits are handled by the isalpha() check
- Both mechanisms achieve the same desired outcome

ACTUAL CODE BEHAVIOR:
The code correctly strips all 8-character suffixes that could be hexadecimal, whether they contain:
- Only letters (via hex_pattern check)
- Only digits (via isalpha() failure)
- Mixed letters and digits (via isalpha() failure)

The implementation achieves the correct behavior, though through a different mechanism than what might be expected from reading the hex_pattern variable name.
