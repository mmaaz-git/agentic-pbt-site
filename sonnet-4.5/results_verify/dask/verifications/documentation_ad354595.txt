DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR DASK.DIAGNOSTICS.PROFILE._TRACKER

## Official Documentation Review

The ResourceProfiler is a documented feature in Dask's diagnostics module that tracks resource usage (memory and CPU) during task execution. Based on the official Dask documentation:

1. **Purpose**: The ResourceProfiler records memory usage (in MB) and CPU percentage at regular intervals during Dask computation execution.

2. **Usage**: It can be used as a context manager or registered globally to profile local (non-distributed) Dask computations.

3. **Key Features**:
   - Records timestamped measurements of memory and CPU usage
   - Provides visualization capabilities through bokeh plots
   - Configurable sampling interval (dt parameter)

## Internal Implementation Details

The _Tracker class is an internal implementation detail, not part of the public API. The documentation does not specify:
- The exact behavior of how the tracker filters processes
- Whether the tracker should include or exclude itself from measurements
- The specific implementation of process filtering

## Code Inspection

From examining the source code at /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/dask_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/diagnostics/profile.py:

1. The _Tracker class is a multiprocessing.Process subclass that runs in a separate process
2. The _update_pids method (line 250-253) is meant to collect all processes to monitor
3. Line 252 contains a filter condition: `p.pid != pid`
4. The intent appears to be filtering out the tracker process itself from monitoring

## Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not explicitly state:
- Whether the ResourceProfiler should include its own overhead in measurements
- The specific filtering behavior for child processes
- Implementation details about process selection

However, based on the code structure and common profiling practices:
- It's reasonable to expect that a profiler should NOT include its own overhead in measurements
- The filter `p.pid != pid` clearly intends to exclude a specific process by PID
- The parameter name `pid` in _update_pids strongly suggests it expects a process ID (integer), not a Process object
