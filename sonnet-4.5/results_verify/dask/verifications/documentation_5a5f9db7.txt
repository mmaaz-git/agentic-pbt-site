DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Division Requirements in Dask DataFrames:
-----------------------------------------

1. GENERAL DIVISION REQUIREMENTS:
   - According to Dask documentation, divisions are a tuple of (npartitions + 1) values
   - They mark the lower/upper bounds of each partition's index
   - Divisions MUST be in ascending order (strictly monotonic increasing)
   - This is fundamental for Dask to know which partition contains a given value
   - Operations like loc, merge, and groupby rely on this property for efficiency

2. EXPLICIT MONOTONICITY REQUIREMENTS:
   From the documentation and source code:
   - "Divisions are a tuple of npartitions + 1 values, in ascending order"
   - When renaming indices: "will check that transformed divisions are monotonic"
   - Source shows error: "The renamer creates an Index with non-monotonic divisions"
   - Multiple references to "monotonic_increasing" checks in the codebase

3. RESAMPLE FUNCTION SPECIFICS:
   - The resample documentation does not explicitly state division monotonicity requirements
   - However, it inherits the general Dask DataFrame division requirements
   - The documentation states it requires a "datetime-like index"
   - No documented exceptions for duplicate divisions in resample output

4. INTERNAL VALIDATION:
   The source code shows:
   - Checks for `is_monotonic_increasing` on divisions
   - References to `_monotonic_divisions` property
   - Operations that depend on division ordering for correctness

5. CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION:
   While not explicitly documented for resample, the general Dask architecture shows:
   - Duplicate divisions create ambiguity about which partition contains data
   - Operations like `loc` may return incorrect results or fail
   - Partitioning operations become undefined

CONCLUSION ON DOCUMENTATION:
The documentation clearly establishes that divisions must be strictly monotonic increasing (no duplicates) for correct Dask operation. While the resample documentation doesn't explicitly restate this, it's a fundamental invariant of the Dask DataFrame design that all operations must respect. The function `_resample_bin_and_out_divs` is an internal helper that must maintain this invariant.
