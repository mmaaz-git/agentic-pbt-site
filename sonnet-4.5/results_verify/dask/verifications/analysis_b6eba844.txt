## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The function enforces non-overlapping names in 3 out of 4 code paths, suggesting this is the intended behavior
2. When users specify overlapping names, the function explicitly raises an error with message "must not intersect"
3. When only one parameter is specified, the function actively filters to prevent overlap
4. The inconsistency creates a real problem: the same field name appears in both column and index lists
5. This could cause data ambiguity and unexpected behavior in downstream operations
6. The bug is easily reproducible and affects a clear invariant of the system

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is private (starts with underscore), suggesting internal implementation detail
- No explicit documentation states that overlap is forbidden in all cases

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The function is private/internal, not part of the public API
2. No documentation explicitly states that data-provided overlaps are forbidden
3. The error message specifically says "Specified index and column names" (emphasis on user-specified)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code pattern strongly suggests overlap prevention is intended in all cases
- 3 out of 4 code paths prevent overlap, making the 4th path inconsistent

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. This might be an edge case that rarely occurs in practice (parquet files with overlapping column/index names)
2. The function is internal/private, not user-facing
3. Real parquet files from pandas/other tools typically wouldn't have this overlap

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The inconsistency is significant and could cause real issues
- The fix is simple and low-risk
- The bug violates an implicit invariant

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation doesn't explicitly state the non-overlap requirement
2. The behavior for data-provided overlaps isn't documented
3. Could be fixed by documenting that overlaps are allowed when both parameters are None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior (not documentation) is clearly inconsistent
- The existing error message already implies overlap is not allowed
- Documenting inconsistent behavior would be confusing

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could be viewed as requesting new validation for the default case
2. The current code "works" but could be enhanced with additional checks

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
- The validation already exists for other code paths
- The invariant is already established, just not uniformly enforced

### Final Assessment

This is a **BUG**. The function has a clear behavioral pattern across 3 of 4 code paths: column and index names must not overlap. The 4th path (when both user parameters are None) violates this pattern by allowing overlaps. This inconsistency is:

1. **Unintentional**: The pattern in other code paths shows clear intent to prevent overlap
2. **Problematic**: Creates ambiguity about whether a field is a column or index
3. **Fixable**: Simple solution that maintains consistency
4. **Not a documentation issue**: The code behavior, not its description, is incorrect

The bug report correctly identifies an inconsistency that violates the function's implicit invariant. While the function is private, it's still used internally and should maintain consistent behavior.
