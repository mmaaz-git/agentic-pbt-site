## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence For:**
- The code crashes with a TypeError when given valid Parquet statistics according to the Apache Parquet specification
- The Apache Parquet format explicitly allows partial statistics (one of min/max being None)
- The function claims to handle "missing stats" but fails on partial None cases
- The comment "min/max cannot be None for remaining checks" is contradicted by the actual code behavior
- This affects real-world use cases with legacy or incomplete Parquet files
- The bug is reproducible and the fix is straightforward
- Similar issue (#9764) was previously fixed, showing this type of bug is recognized as valid

**Evidence Against:**
- None - this appears to be a clear bug

#### INVALID
**Evidence For:**
- None

**Evidence Against:**
- The bug report correctly identifies a real crash with valid input
- The Parquet specification explicitly supports the failing case
- The code doesn't handle a documented valid case

#### WONTFIX
**Evidence For:**
- Could argue that partial statistics are rare in practice

**Evidence Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - partial statistics are explicitly allowed by the Parquet spec
- The crash prevents reading valid Parquet files
- The fix is simple and doesn't impact performance
- Real users encounter this with legacy Parquet files or files from certain writers

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Evidence For:**
- The internal comment claims "min/max cannot be None" but doesn't enforce it

**Evidence Against:**
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue
- The function crashes rather than handling the case gracefully
- The Parquet specification is clear that partial stats must be handled

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Evidence For:**
- Could argue that supporting partial statistics is a new feature

**Evidence Against:**
- The Parquet specification requires readers to handle missing min/max gracefully
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The function already claims to handle "missing stats"

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. **Specification Violation**: The Apache Parquet format specification explicitly allows min or max to be None independently, and requires readers to handle this gracefully. The current implementation violates this specification.

2. **Crash on Valid Input**: The function crashes with a TypeError when given input that is valid according to the Parquet specification.

3. **Inconsistent Implementation**: The code has comments claiming "min/max cannot be None for remaining checks" but doesn't actually validate this assumption before performing comparisons.

4. **Real-World Impact**: This affects users working with:
   - Legacy Parquet files
   - Files with incomplete statistics
   - Files from certain Parquet writers that omit some statistics

5. **Simple Fix Available**: The bug report provides reasonable fixes that would handle the case properly without breaking existing functionality.

6. **Precedent**: Similar issues (like #9764) have been recognized and fixed in the Dask codebase.

The function fails to fulfill its documented purpose of handling partition-level filtering with missing statistics. This is not an enhancement request or documentation issue - it's a failure to correctly implement the Parquet specification's requirements for handling optional statistics.
