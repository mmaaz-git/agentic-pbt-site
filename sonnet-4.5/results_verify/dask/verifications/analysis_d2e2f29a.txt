## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering: INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The test suite explicitly tests for this exact behavior (sample must end with delimiter)
- The code clearly attempts to implement this behavior (lines 178-181 split at delimiter)
- The behavior is logical and consistent with the concept of delimiter-based boundaries
- The bug only occurs in a specific edge case (small files), not a fundamental misunderstanding

**Conclusion:** This is NOT an INVALID bug report.

### Considering: WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Could be considered an edge case (very small files)
- Existing tests with larger files pass

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The bug violates explicitly tested behavior
- Small files are common in testing and development
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't impact performance
- Data correctness is important for a data processing library

**Conclusion:** This is NOT a WONTFIX issue - data correctness matters.

### Considering: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state sample/delimiter interaction

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The test suite clearly defines expected behavior
- The code attempts to implement the correct behavior (but has a bug)
- The documentation's description of "clean delimiter boundaries" implies this behavior
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue

**Conclusion:** This is NOT a DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the code is wrong, not the documentation.

### Considering: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not requesting new functionality
- The existing test suite already expects this behavior
- The code already attempts to implement this (but fails in edge case)
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

**Conclusion:** This is NOT a FEATURE_REQUEST.

### Considering: BUG
**Strong arguments for BUG:**
1. **Test suite violation**: The existing test `test_read_bytes_sample_delimiter` explicitly asserts `sample.endswith(b"\n")`
2. **Clear implementation intent**: Lines 178-181 show the code trying to split at delimiter boundaries
3. **Logic error identified**: The delimiter check only happens on subsequent reads, missing the initial buffer
4. **Reproducible**: Both hypothesis and manual tests consistently reproduce the issue
5. **Violates documented behavior**: "cleanly breaks data by a delimiter" should apply to samples too
6. **Fix is straightforward**: Check delimiter in initial buffer before entering the loop
7. **Real impact**: Incorrect data boundaries affect downstream processing

**Conclusion:** This is clearly a BUG.

### Final Assessment
This is a legitimate BUG in the `read_bytes` function. The implementation has a logic error where it fails to check for the delimiter in the initial read buffer, only checking subsequent reads. This violates the behavior explicitly tested by the test suite and the logical expectation that samples respect delimiter boundaries when delimiters are specified.
