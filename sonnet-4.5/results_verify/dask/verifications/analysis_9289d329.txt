## Bug Categorization Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: The function returns `str` for +/- but `float` for *// operations
2. **Function naming**: "_sqlite_format_dtdelta" implies formatting/string output
3. **Code comment**: "It will be formatted as..." suggests string output is expected
4. **Partial implementation**: 2 of 4 paths call `str()`, suggesting the other 2 are missing it
5. **Principle of least surprise**: Functions should have consistent return types
6. **Real impact**: Code expecting strings will fail for multiplication/division

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- SQLite allows dynamic typing, so technically this works
- No explicit documentation states return type must be consistent

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments FOR:**
- No explicit documentation specifies return types must be strings
- SQLite accepts different types from UDFs
- The function technically works as implemented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function name clearly includes "format" suggesting string output
2. The comment explicitly mentions formatting
3. The inconsistency between operations is clearly unintentional
4. 50% of the code paths already convert to string

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- It's an internal function (starts with _)
- Might not affect real-world usage significantly
- SQLite handles type conversion automatically in many cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - it affects 50% of operations
2. The fix is trivial (add str() to 2 lines)
3. It creates actual type inconsistency that can break code
4. The function is used in Django's ORM operations

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function lacks explicit documentation about return types
- Could document that it returns mixed types

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code comment already says "It will be formatted"
2. The function name includes "format"
3. This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue
4. Documenting inconsistent behavior would be worse than fixing it

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be framed as "please make return types consistent"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. The function already partially implements string conversion
3. The intent (from naming and comments) was always to format as strings

### Conclusion:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The evidence overwhelmingly points to an implementation oversight where `str()` conversion was forgotten for multiplication and division operations. The function name, code comments, and partial implementation all indicate that consistent string formatting was the original intent. This is not a documentation issue or feature request - it's inconsistent behavior that violates the principle of least surprise and the function's apparent design intent.
