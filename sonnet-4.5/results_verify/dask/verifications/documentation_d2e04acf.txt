DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have reviewed the documentation for dask.bytes.read_bytes from the function's docstring in the source code (dask/bytes/core.py, lines 24-79):

1. SAMPLE PARAMETER DOCUMENTATION (lines 51-54):
   ```
   sample : int, string, or boolean
       Whether or not to return a header sample.
       Values can be ``False`` for "no sample requested"
       Or an integer or string value like ``2**20`` or ``"1 MiB"``
   ```

   Key observations:
   - The parameter accepts int, string, or boolean
   - False means "no sample requested"
   - Integer values are explicitly mentioned as valid inputs
   - Examples show integer (2**20) and string ("1 MiB") values

2. RETURN VALUE DOCUMENTATION (lines 68-77):
   ```
   Returns
   -------
   sample : bytes
       The sample header
   blocks : list of lists of ``dask.Delayed``
       ...
   ```

   Key observation:
   - The sample return value is explicitly documented as "bytes"
   - There is NO mention of any case where sample could be returned as a different type
   - There is NO exception documented for sample=0 returning an integer

3. DOCUMENTATION INTERPRETATION:
   - The documentation clearly states that when an integer is provided for sample, it specifies the number of bytes to read
   - The return type is unambiguously specified as "bytes"
   - There is no documented special case for sample=0 that would allow returning an integer
   - The only special case is sample=False for "no sample requested", which correctly returns False

4. EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION:
   - Could not access the online Dask documentation (404 error)
   - The primary source of truth is the docstring in the source code

5. CONCLUSION:
   The documentation clearly establishes that:
   - sample=0 (integer) is a valid input
   - The function should return bytes for the sample
   - There is no documented exception allowing integer 0 to be returned
   - The current behavior (returning integer 0) violates the documented contract
