## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code raises an unexpected `KeyError` in a reasonable use case
- Multiple callback instances should be independently manageable
- The behavior violates the principle of least surprise
- The codebase is internally inconsistent (`add_callbacks` uses `discard()` while `Callback` uses `remove()`)
- The fix is trivial and makes the API more robust
- Real-world scenarios could trigger this (testing, dynamic callback creation, parallel processing)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise independent callback management
- Users could work around by checking if callback is in active set before unregistering

#### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state that multiple identical callbacks should work independently
- The behavior is technically correct given the set-based implementation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The error is unexpected and undocumented
- Similar code in the same module (`add_callbacks`) handles this correctly
- Users have reasonable expectations that each object instance is independent

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Edge case that might rarely occur in production
- Users can work around by using different callback parameters
- Only affects callbacks with identical configurations

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Not that rare - default `Callback()` instances are common in testing
- The fix is trivial and improves robustness
- The error is confusing and hard to debug for users
- Inconsistent with how `add_callbacks` already handles the same situation

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be seen as requesting new functionality for independent callback management

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- `unregister()` already exists but doesn't work correctly in this case
- The API already implies this should work (each instance has its own methods)

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that identical callbacks share state and can't be independently unregistered
- Could add warnings about creating multiple identical callbacks

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- Documenting a workaround for buggy behavior is not the right solution
- The fix to the code is simpler than explaining the limitation

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The strongest evidence:

1. **Unexpected Error**: The code raises an undocumented `KeyError` in a reasonable use case
2. **Internal Inconsistency**: The same codebase uses `discard()` in `add_callbacks` to avoid this exact problem
3. **Violates Reasonable Expectations**: Each object instance should be independently manageable
4. **Simple Fix Available**: Changing `remove()` to `discard()` is trivial and safe
5. **Real Impact**: This affects testing scenarios and dynamic callback creation

The bug report is well-written, includes a minimal reproduction case, identifies the root cause correctly, and proposes a reasonable fix that aligns with how the codebase already handles similar situations elsewhere.

This should be categorized as BUG and the proposed fix (using `discard()` instead of `remove()`) should be implemented.
