Documentation Analysis for dask.dataframe.io.orc.read_orc
===========================================================

Official Documentation Review
-----------------------------

I reviewed the official Dask documentation for read_orc at https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.dataframe.read_orc.html.

Key findings from the documentation:

1. The `columns` parameter is described as: "Columns to load. If None, loads all."
   - No mention of special handling needed for index columns

2. The `index` parameter is described as: "Column name to set as index"
   - No mention that this column must be included in the columns parameter

3. The documentation provides no explicit guidance on the interaction between `columns` and `index` parameters.

4. There are no warnings or notes indicating that users must include the index column in the columns list.

Comparison with Related Functions
---------------------------------

1. pandas.read_csv Documentation:
   - I checked the pandas documentation and found no explicit statement about the interaction between usecols and index_col
   - Testing shows pandas also fails when index_col is not in usecols
   - However, this is not clearly documented either

2. dask.dataframe.read_parquet:
   - The documentation structure is similar to read_orc
   - No explicit mention of index column handling with columns parameter
   - However, testing shows read_parquet DOES automatically include the index column

Documentation Gaps
------------------

The documentation does not specify:
1. Whether the index column must be explicitly included in the columns parameter
2. What the expected behavior should be when index is not in columns
3. Whether this behavior should be consistent across different read_* functions in Dask

Expected Behavior Based on Documentation
-----------------------------------------

Given the lack of explicit documentation about this interaction, users would reasonably expect one of two behaviors:

1. The function automatically includes the index column (like read_parquet does)
2. The function provides a clear error message explaining the requirement

The current cryptic KeyError does not meet either expectation.

Principle of Least Surprise
----------------------------

From a user perspective, when specifying:
- columns=['a', 'b'] - "I want to load these columns"
- index='c' - "I want c as my index"

The most intuitive behavior would be for the function to automatically load column 'c' to fulfill the index requirement, even if not explicitly listed in columns. This is what read_parquet does.

Conclusion
----------

The documentation does not explicitly state that the index column must be included in the columns parameter. The inconsistency with read_parquet and the unhelpful error message suggest this is a bug rather than intended behavior that should be documented.
