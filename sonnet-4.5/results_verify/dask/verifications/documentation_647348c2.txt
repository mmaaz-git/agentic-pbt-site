DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS REPORT
=============================

## Function Documentation Review

The read_bytes function in dask.bytes.core has the following documented behavior:

### Purpose
"Given a path or paths, return delayed objects that read from those paths."
"This cleanly breaks data by a delimiter if given, so that block boundaries start directly after a delimiter and end on the delimiter."

### not_zero Parameter Documentation
From the docstring (line 45-46):
```
not_zero : bool
    Force seek of start-of-file delimiter, discarding header.
```

The parameter is intended to skip header data at the beginning of files by starting reads from position 1 instead of 0.

### Return Values
The function returns blocks which are documented as:
```
blocks : list of lists of ``dask.Delayed``
    Each list corresponds to a file, and each delayed object computes to a
    block of bytes from that file.
```

## Critical Invariants (Inferred from Implementation)

While not explicitly documented, the implementation strongly suggests these invariants:

1. **Offsets should be strictly increasing**: The code generates offsets using:
   ```python
   while size - place > (blocksize1 * 2) - 1:
       place += blocksize1
       off.append(int(place))
   ```
   This creates a strictly increasing sequence.

2. **Blocks should be non-overlapping**: The length calculation `length.append(off[-1] - off[-2])` assumes each block starts where the previous one ended.

3. **Complete file coverage**: The blocks should collectively cover the entire file without gaps.

## Documentation Gap

The documentation does NOT explicitly state that:
- Offsets must be strictly increasing
- Blocks must be non-overlapping
- How not_zero interacts with small files or edge cases

However, these properties are fundamental to the correct operation of byte-level file reading. The function's purpose of "cleanly breaking data" implies non-overlapping, complete coverage of the file.

## Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state the "strictly increasing offsets" invariant, this is an implicit requirement for correct file reading behavior. The bug violates a reasonable and necessary invariant that any file reading system must maintain - that blocks don't overlap and reading positions are sequential.
