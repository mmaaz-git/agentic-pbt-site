## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report.

### Property-Based Test Results
The Hypothesis property-based test failed as expected, demonstrating that multiplication and division operations return `float` types instead of `str`:
- Test failure message: `AssertionError: format_dtdelta('*', 1.0, 1.0) should return string, got <class 'float'>`
- The test correctly identifies that "*" and "/" operators return float values

### Manual Reproduction Results
Running the explicit test case confirmed the inconsistent return types:
```
Addition returns: <class 'str'>
Subtraction returns: <class 'str'>
Multiplication returns: <class 'float'>
Division returns: <class 'float'>
```

Actual values returned:
- Addition (1000000 + 2000000): "0:00:03" (string)
- Subtraction (2000000 - 1000000): "0:00:01" (string)
- Multiplication (2.5 * 3.0): 7.5 (float)
- Division (6.0 / 2.0): 3.0 (float)

### Code Analysis
Examining the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/django_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/_functions.py`:

Lines 264-274 show the inconsistency:
- Lines 267 and 269: Addition and subtraction explicitly call `str()` on the result
- Lines 271 and 273: Multiplication and division do NOT call `str()` on the result

The comment on lines 265-266 states "It will be formatted as..." which implies string formatting should occur for all operations.

### Effect
This type inconsistency means:
1. SQLite queries using this function will receive different Python types depending on the operation
2. Code that relies on the result being a string will fail for multiplication/division
3. The function name "_sqlite_format_dtdelta" suggests formatting (to string) should always occur
4. The inconsistency appears unintentional given that 2 of 4 code paths explicitly convert to string
