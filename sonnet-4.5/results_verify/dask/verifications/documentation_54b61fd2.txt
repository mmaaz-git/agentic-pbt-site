DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

## Documentation Review

I have reviewed the documentation for `dask.bytes.core.read_bytes` from multiple sources:

### 1. Source Code Documentation (Docstring)
Located in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/bytes/core.py`

The function docstring clearly states:
```
sample : int, string, or boolean
    Whether or not to return a header sample.
    Values can be ``False`` for "no sample requested"
    Or an integer or string value like ``2**20`` or ``"1 MiB"``
```

Key points:
- The parameter accepts integer values to specify the sample size in bytes
- String values like "1 MiB" are parsed to byte sizes
- The documentation clearly indicates this controls "header sample" size
- Default value is "10 kiB" (about 10,240 bytes)

### 2. Function Behavior Documentation
The docstring explains:
- "This cleanly breaks data by a delimiter if given, so that block boundaries start directly after a delimiter and end on the delimiter."
- Returns section states: "sample : bytes - The sample header"

### 3. User Expectations from Documentation
Based on the documentation, users would reasonably expect:
1. When `sample=100` is specified, approximately 100 bytes should be returned as the sample
2. When `sample="1 MiB"` is specified, approximately 1 MiB should be returned
3. The sample size parameter should limit memory usage for the header sample
4. The delimiter parameter should work in conjunction with sample, not override it

### 4. Documentation Clarity
The documentation is clear about what the `sample` parameter does:
- It controls the size of the header sample returned
- It accepts specific byte values (as int or string)
- It's meant to provide a preview/sample of the data

### 5. What the Documentation Does NOT Say
The documentation does NOT indicate that:
- When a delimiter is specified, the sample size limit might be ignored
- The function might read the entire file if delimiter is not found
- There's any special interaction between `sample` and `delimiter` that would cause unbounded reading

## Conclusion
The documentation clearly establishes that the `sample` parameter should limit the amount of data read for the header sample. The current behavior where the entire file is read when a delimiter is not found directly contradicts the documented purpose and expected behavior of the `sample` parameter. Users specifying `sample=100` have a reasonable expectation that approximately 100 bytes will be read, not potentially gigabytes of data.
