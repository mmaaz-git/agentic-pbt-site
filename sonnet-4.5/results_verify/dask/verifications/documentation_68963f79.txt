## Documentation Analysis

### Current Dask Documentation

**head() method:**
- Full documentation with detailed parameter descriptions
- Parameters: n (int, default 5), npartitions (int, default 1), compute (bool, default True)
- Clear explanation that npartitions controls how many partitions to search
- Option to use -1 to search all partitions
- Warns if fewer than n rows are found in the specified partitions

**tail() method:**
- Minimal documentation
- Parameters: n (int, default 5), compute (bool, default True)
- Missing npartitions parameter entirely
- Documentation explicitly states limitation: "Caveat, the only checks the last n rows of the last partition"
- This caveat directly acknowledges a functional limitation

### Pandas Documentation (Reference Implementation)

**pandas head() and tail():**
- Both have symmetric APIs with only an 'n' parameter
- Both return the first/last n rows respectively
- Both handle negative n values similarly
- Both return all rows if n exceeds the number of rows
- Documentation explicitly cross-references between head() and tail() as complementary operations

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **The limitation is documented**: The tail() docstring explicitly states "Caveat, the only checks the last n rows of the last partition", acknowledging the limitation.

2. **Asymmetric API is intentional in current implementation**: The source code shows head() takes npartitions parameter while tail() does not.

3. **Conceptual symmetry expectation**: Pandas' documentation treats head() and tail() as symmetric, complementary operations. Users would reasonably expect similar behavior in Dask.

4. **Functional limitation acknowledged**: The documentation admits tail() only checks the last partition, which is a significant limitation in distributed computing context where data spans multiple partitions.

5. **No external specification**: There is no RFC or external standard that defines how distributed dataframe head/tail should work. This is purely a design decision within the Dask project.

### Assessment

The documentation clearly shows:
- The asymmetry between head() and tail() is real and documented
- The limitation of tail() only checking the last partition is explicitly acknowledged as a "Caveat"
- This is not undocumented behavior - the limitation is clearly stated
- However, the limitation seems arbitrary given that head() already implements the npartitions functionality
