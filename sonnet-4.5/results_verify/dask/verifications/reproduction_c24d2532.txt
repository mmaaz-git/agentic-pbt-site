BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

The bug has been successfully reproduced. Both the simple reproduction case and the property-based test fail with the exact error described in the bug report.

## Test Results:

1. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - Created a DataFrame with values [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
   - Attempted to compute: ddf.nlargest(1, 'x')['x'].compute()
   - Result: TypeError: Series.nlargest() got an unexpected keyword argument 'columns'
   - The error occurs exactly as described in the bug report

2. Property-Based Test:
   - The test immediately fails on the first example with the same TypeError
   - The specific failing input mentioned in the report (data=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1], n=1) reproduces the error

3. Pandas Comparison:
   - The equivalent pandas operation df.nlargest(1, 'x')['x'] works correctly and returns [1]
   - This confirms that the dask behavior deviates from pandas behavior

## Error Analysis:

The traceback shows the error occurs at:
- File: /dask/dataframe/dask_expr/_reductions.py, line 1339
- Method: NLargest.chunk()
- The method calls cls.reduction_chunk(df, **kwargs) with kwargs={'columns': 'x', 'n': 1}

The root cause is confirmed:
- When df.nlargest(n, column)[column] is called, the resulting expression becomes a Series
- However, the NLargest class still passes the 'columns' parameter to the chunk method
- Since the data is now a Series (not a DataFrame), it calls Series.nlargest()
- pandas Series.nlargest() only accepts parameters 'n' and 'keep', not 'columns'
- This causes the TypeError

The bug is reproducible and behaves exactly as described in the report.
