## Documentation Analysis for truncate_name Function

### Function Docstring
The function's docstring states:
"Shorten an SQL identifier to a repeatable mangled version with the given length.

If a quote stripped name contains a namespace, e.g. USERNAME"."TABLE, truncate the table portion only."

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Primary Purpose**: The function should "shorten an SQL identifier to a repeatable mangled version with the given length." This clearly states that the function should produce an identifier that fits within the specified length.

2. **Namespace Handling**: The docstring explicitly mentions that "If a quote stripped name contains a namespace, e.g. USERNAME"."TABLE, truncate the table portion only." This indicates that when a namespace is present, only the table portion should be truncated, not the namespace.

3. **Django Database Documentation**: According to Django's official database documentation:
   - Oracle databases have a 30-character identifier limit
   - Django automatically truncates identifiers to fit this limit
   - The truncation process replaces the final 4 characters with an MD5 hash for uniqueness

4. **Length Parameter**: The function signature shows `length=None`, meaning the length limit is optional. When specified, the function should respect this limit.

### Critical Observation
The docstring says "truncate the table portion only" when a namespace is present. This could be interpreted two ways:
1. Only the table portion should be considered for truncation (current implementation)
2. Only the table portion should be truncated, but the overall result should still fit within the length limit

The phrase "Shorten an SQL identifier to a repeatable mangled version with the given length" strongly suggests the entire identifier should fit within the specified length, as it refers to shortening "an SQL identifier" (singular, complete entity) to "the given length."

### Related Functions
The `split_identifier()` function is used to separate namespace from name, and `strip_quotes()` is documented as handling Oracle naming schemes like '"USER"."TABLE"'.
