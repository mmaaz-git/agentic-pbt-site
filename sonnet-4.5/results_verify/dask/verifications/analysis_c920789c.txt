## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report assumes an invariant ("all block lengths must be positive") that is never explicitly documented in the function's docstring or elsewhere in the codebase. The documentation only states that `not_zero` will "Force seek of start-of-file delimiter, discarding header" without specifying what happens in edge cases. Since there's no documented requirement that blocks must have positive length, and the current implementation technically works (returns empty bytes for zero-length blocks), this could be considered expected behavior for an undocumented edge case.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug is technically real - the code does produce zero-length blocks and duplicate offsets. While not explicitly documented as forbidden, having a zero-length block is semantically questionable (why have a block that contains no data?) and duplicate offsets suggest the same file position would be read twice, which doesn't make logical sense. The behavior is counterintuitive even if not explicitly forbidden.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an extremely edge case that only occurs when using `not_zero=True` with tiny files where the first block would be exactly 1 byte. The parameter `not_zero` appears to have no tests in the dask codebase and seems rarely used. The issue only manifests with unusual combinations like a 2-byte file with 1-byte blocks. In practice, dask is typically used for large-scale data processing where blocks are megabytes in size, not single bytes. The effort to fix this might not be worth it for such an obscure scenario.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even edge cases can cause problems in production systems. The fact that the code produces demonstrably incorrect data structures (duplicate offsets, zero-length blocks) suggests a logic error that should be fixed. Just because the bug is rare doesn't mean it should be ignored, especially since it could silently cause issues for users who happen to hit this case.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify what happens when `not_zero=True` would result in a zero or negative length block. It could be argued that the documentation should explicitly state this limitation, such as "not_zero requires that the first block is at least 2 bytes" or "not_zero may produce zero-length blocks for very small files." The current behavior might be intentional but poorly documented.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior seems unintentional rather than a documentation oversight. Producing zero-length blocks and duplicate offsets appears to be a bug in the implementation logic rather than intended behavior that needs better documentation. Documenting this as expected behavior would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current implementation doesn't handle the edge case where `not_zero=True` with small first blocks. Adding proper handling for this case (either by merging blocks, skipping the not_zero adjustment, or raising an informative error) would be a new feature that extends the robustness of the function. The bug report even suggests a specific enhancement: raising a ValueError with a clear message.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but rather fixing existing functionality that produces incorrect results. The `not_zero` parameter already exists and should work correctly for all valid inputs. Making it work properly isn't a feature request but a bug fix.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code produces objectively incorrect output: zero-length blocks (which serve no purpose and may break downstream code expecting actual data) and duplicate offsets (suggesting the same file position would be read multiple times). This violates basic principles of file chunking where each chunk should contain some data and have a unique position. The implementation has a clear logic error where it blindly subtracts 1 from length[0] without checking if this would make it negative or zero.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function still technically works - it returns data that can be computed without errors, and the total bytes read is correct (size - 1 as expected). There's no documented contract that blocks must have positive length, and the `not_zero` parameter has zero test coverage suggesting it might be an experimental or deprecated feature. The behavior could be considered undefined for this edge case rather than incorrect.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate bug, though an edge case one. The code produces data structures that are semantically incorrect (zero-length blocks and duplicate offsets) due to a clear logic error in the implementation. When `not_zero=True`, the code unconditionally subtracts 1 from `length[0]` without checking if this would make it zero or negative, which is an oversight in the implementation.

However, the severity and practical impact of this bug is extremely limited. The `not_zero` parameter appears to be rarely used (it has no tests in the codebase), and the problematic case only occurs with tiny files and tiny block sizes that are atypical for dask's intended use cases in large-scale data processing. No user would reasonably use 1-byte blocks on 2-byte files in production.

Given that this is an undocumented edge case in a rarely-used parameter with minimal practical impact, and considering the report comes from an unreliable source with a 90% false positive rate, I lean toward classifying this as WONTFIX. While technically a bug, it's such an obscure edge case that fixing it provides negligible value. The maintainers would likely close this as "won't fix - edge case with no practical impact" or potentially ask for evidence of real-world impact before considering a fix.
