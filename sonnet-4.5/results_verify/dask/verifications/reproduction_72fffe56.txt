## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Confirmed
The bug report is accurate. I successfully reproduced the TypeError when calling `ArrowORCEngine._aggregate_files` with the following conditions:
- `aggregate_files=True`
- `split_stripes > 1` (tested with value 2)
- `parts` containing tuples with `None` as the stripe value

### Error Details
The error occurs at line 86 in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/dataframe/io/orc/arrow.py`:
```python
nstripes = len(new_part[0][1])
```

When `new_part[0][1]` is `None`, calling `len()` on it raises:
```
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

### Root Cause
The bug report correctly identifies the root cause:
1. When `read_metadata` is called with `split_stripes=False`, it creates parts with `None` stripe values (line 63 in the code)
2. The `_aggregate_files` method assumes all stripe values are lists and calls `len()` on them without checking for `None`
3. This creates an incompatibility between `split_stripes=False` and `aggregate_files=True` with `split_stripes > 1`

### Test Results
Both test cases from the bug report failed as expected:
1. The direct reproduction case with `split_stripes=2` raised a TypeError
2. The hypothesis test also failed on the first example with `split_stripes_val=2`

The bug is real and affects the documented functionality of the ORC file aggregation feature.
