BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. REPRODUCIBILITY:
The bug is 100% reproducible with the provided test case.

2. TEST CASE VERIFICATION:
Input: pd.Series([0.0]*5, index=pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=5, freq='h'))
Rule: 'ME' (month-end frequency)
Result: ValueError with message "Index is not contained within new index"

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The bug occurs due to a mismatch between:
a) What pandas.resample() produces: Index at 2000-01-31 (month-end anchor point)
b) What pd.date_range(start='2000-01-01 00:00', end='2000-01-01 04:00', freq='ME') produces: Empty DatetimeIndex

The function incorrectly assumes pd.date_range will generate the same indices as resample().

4. SCOPE OF THE BUG:
Testing shows the bug affects ALL anchor-based frequencies:
- 'ME' (month-end): FAILS on short time spans
- 'QE' (quarter-end): FAILS on short time spans
- 'YE' (year-end): FAILS on short time spans
- 'D', 'h', etc. (non-anchor frequencies): WORKS correctly

5. PANDAS BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION:
Confirmed that pandas.resample() does indeed create indices at anchor points:
- Data from Jan 1-10 → resample('ME') → Index at Jan 31
- Data from Jan 1-10 → resample('QE') → Index at Mar 31
- Data from Jan 1-10 → resample('YE') → Index at Dec 31

6. TECHNICAL DETAILS:
The problematic code is in lines 47-63 of _resample_series:
- Line 38-40: Performs pandas resample (works correctly)
- Line 47-54: Creates new_index using pd.date_range (creates wrong index for anchor frequencies)
- Line 56: Checks if out.index is contained in new_index (fails because new_index is empty/wrong)
- Line 63: Would reindex if check passed

7. USER IMPACT:
This makes dask resample unusable for common business use cases like:
- Monthly reporting on partial month data
- Quarterly aggregations on partial quarter data
- Annual summaries on partial year data

The error message suggests using "larger partitions" but this won't help - the issue is fundamental to how the function constructs the expected index.
