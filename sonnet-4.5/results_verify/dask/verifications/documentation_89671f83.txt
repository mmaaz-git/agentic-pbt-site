# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### 1. Dask read_orc() Documentation
From the official Dask documentation and source code docstring:
- The `index` parameter is described as: "Column name to set as index"
- No mention of automatic index restoration when reading files written with `write_index=True`
- No guidance on how to handle round-trip scenarios
- No warning that the index will not be automatically preserved

### 2. Dask to_orc() Documentation
From the official documentation and source code:
- The `write_index` parameter is described as: "Whether or not to write the index. Defaults to True."
- No mention of how to read back the written index
- No warning that users need to manually specify the index column when reading
- No cross-reference to the read_orc index parameter

### 3. Critical Documentation Gaps
The documentation fails to explain:
1. That when `write_index=True` (the default), the index is saved as `__index_level_0__` column
2. That users must explicitly specify `index='__index_level_0__'` when reading to restore the index
3. That ORC behaves differently from Parquet in this regard
4. The lack of round-trip guarantee for index preservation

### 4. Comparison with Related Formats
The documentation does not mention that:
- Parquet format automatically preserves and restores indices in round-trips
- ORC format requires manual index specification for restoration
- This inconsistency exists between the two formats in Dask

## Documentation Verdict
The documentation is incomplete and misleading:
- It suggests that `write_index=True` will write the index but doesn't explain the implications
- It doesn't warn users that the index won't be automatically restored
- It doesn't provide examples showing the correct way to preserve indices in ORC round-trips
- The behavior is counterintuitive given that Parquet (a similar columnar format) handles this automatically
