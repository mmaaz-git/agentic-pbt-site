## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Category: BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The function violates an explicitly documented guarantee in its docstring
- The docstring states "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters"
- The word "always" makes this a strong contract, not a suggestion
- The violation occurs for valid inputs within the specified range (values < 2**60)
- This could break code that relies on the 10-character guarantee for formatting or layout purposes
- The bug is easily reproducible and affects a specific range of values (1000-1024 PiB)

### Category: WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The affected range (1000+ PiB) represents extremely large values that are rarely encountered in practice
- 1 PiB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes (over 1 quadrillion bytes)
- 1000 PiB = over 1 quintillion bytes
- These values are so large that they're unlikely to be encountered in real-world scenarios
- The violation is only 1 character over the limit (11 vs 10)
- The function still works correctly and produces readable output

### Category: INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Cannot be INVALID - the bug is real and reproducible
- The documentation makes an explicit claim that is demonstrably false
- The test case is valid and within the specified bounds

### Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The function works correctly in terms of formatting bytes into human-readable strings
- The only issue is the documented guarantee about string length
- The easiest fix would be to update the documentation to say "typically <= 10 characters" or "<=11 characters"
- The function's core purpose (formatting bytes) is fulfilled correctly
- Changing the documentation would be less risky than changing the implementation

### Category: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Cannot be FEATURE_REQUEST - the issue is about existing behavior not matching documentation
- This is not requesting new functionality but pointing out a discrepancy

### Recommendation
This should be categorized as either:
1. **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** (most appropriate) - The function works correctly for its intended purpose, and the simplest solution is to update the documentation to reflect the actual behavior
2. **BUG** (if the 10-character limit is critical) - If users rely on this guarantee for layout/formatting purposes

Given that:
- The affected values are extremely large and rarely encountered
- The function still produces correct, readable output
- The violation is minimal (1 extra character)
- Fixing the code could introduce more complexity or affect existing output

**I recommend DOCUMENTATION_FIX** as the most appropriate categorization.
