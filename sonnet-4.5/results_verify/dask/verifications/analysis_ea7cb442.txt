## Bug Report Analysis

### Considering Each Category:

#### BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The function crashes with an uninformative ZeroDivisionError instead of handling the edge case gracefully
- Other statistical libraries (NumPy, Pandas, statistics) handle empty collections more gracefully
- Other dask.bag operations like count() and sum() handle empty bags correctly
- The error message doesn't indicate the actual problem (empty bag) but rather shows a low-level implementation detail
- The proposed fix is reasonable and would improve user experience
- This is a common edge case that users might reasonably encounter

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The documentation doesn't promise any particular behavior for empty bags
- Computing mean of an empty set is mathematically undefined
- The crash does prevent returning an incorrect value

#### INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't specify what should happen with empty bags
- Mean of empty set is mathematically undefined, so any behavior could be considered correct
- The test adds a workaround (`data if data else [0]`) suggesting the tester knew empty bags weren't supported

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The error is a low-level ZeroDivisionError rather than a semantic error
- Other similar functions in the ecosystem handle this better
- Users reasonably expect better error handling for common edge cases

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- It's an edge case that users can work around by checking for empty bags first
- The mathematical operation is undefined anyway

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty collections are common in data processing
- The fix is simple and would improve usability
- Other statistical functions (std, var) have the same issue

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could specify that mean() doesn't work with empty bags
- Users need to know about this limitation

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current behavior appears to be a bug rather than intended behavior
- Simply documenting a ZeroDivisionError would be poor API design

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Handling empty bags gracefully could be seen as a new feature
- The current code never intended to handle empty bags

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior rather than adding new functionality
- Basic error handling is not a feature but a bug fix

### Conclusion

This is best categorized as **BUG** because:

1. The error is uninformative and exposes implementation details
2. Similar operations in the same library (count, sum) handle empty bags correctly
3. Industry-standard libraries handle this case more gracefully
4. The fix is simple and improves the API
5. This is a reasonable edge case users will encounter in practice
6. Even if the operation is mathematically undefined, the library should fail gracefully with an informative error

While the documentation doesn't promise specific behavior for empty bags, the current ZeroDivisionError is clearly unintended behavior that should be fixed rather than documented.
