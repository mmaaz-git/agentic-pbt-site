DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Function Docstring:
   The format_bytes function's docstring explicitly states:
   "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

   This is a clear, unambiguous contract that the function promises to uphold.

2. Source Code Documentation:
   - Located in: dask/utils.py, line 1788
   - The guarantee is part of the official docstring
   - No conditional language like "usually" or "typically" - it says "always"

3. External Documentation:
   - Dask's official API documentation repeats the same guarantee
   - The documentation shows examples of formatted outputs
   - No mention of exceptions or edge cases for the 10-character limit

4. Documentation Intent:
   The 10-character limit appears to be an intentional design constraint, likely for:
   - Fixed-width display in terminals or tables
   - UI layout consistency
   - Predictable output formatting

5. Contract Violation:
   The documentation makes a specific, testable claim that is demonstrably false.
   This is not a case of:
   - Ambiguous wording
   - Undefined behavior
   - Implementation-defined behavior
   - Missing documentation

   Rather, it's a direct contradiction between the documented behavior and actual behavior.

6. Conclusion:
   The documentation establishes a clear contract that the implementation violates.
   Either the code needs to be fixed to honor the contract, or the documentation
   needs to be updated to reflect the actual behavior. Given that this is a
   documented guarantee that users may depend on, this is a valid bug.
