Bug: dask.array.slicing.normalize_slice incorrectly handles empty slices with negative step

## Reproduction Verification

### 1. Hypothesis Test Verification
The provided Hypothesis test was executed successfully and correctly identified the bug:
- Test case: start=-2, stop=-2, step=-1, dim=1
- Expected behavior: Should return an empty array (same as NumPy)
- Actual behavior: normalize_slice returns slice(-1, None, -1) which produces [0] instead of []
- The test correctly fails with an AssertionError

### 2. Manual Test Verification
The manual reproduction code was executed and confirms the bug:
- NumPy: arr[slice(-2, -2, -1)] = [] (empty array)
- Dask: darr[slice(-2, -2, -1)].compute() = [0] (non-empty array)
- This demonstrates that Dask arrays behave differently from NumPy arrays for the same slice

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs in the normalize_slice function at lines 791-795:
```python
elif step < 0:
    if start >= dim - 1:
        start = None
    if stop < 0:
        stop = None
```

When slice(-2, -2, -1) is processed:
1. idx.indices(1) returns (-1, -1, -1)
2. The function enters the negative step branch
3. Since stop=-1 < 0, it sets stop=None
4. This transforms slice(-1, -1, -1) to slice(-1, None, -1)
5. slice(-1, None, -1) selects everything from the last element backwards (the entire array reversed)
6. This is incorrect - slice(-1, -1, -1) should be empty since start equals stop

### 4. Standard Python/NumPy Behavior
Testing confirms that both Python lists and NumPy arrays consistently return empty results when start equals stop, regardless of step value:
- Python list: [0][-2:-2:-1] = []
- NumPy array: np.array([0])[-2:-2:-1] = []

This is the expected behavior per Python's slicing semantics where a slice with start==stop always produces an empty result.

## Conclusion
The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The normalize_slice function incorrectly transforms empty slices with negative steps into non-empty slices by setting stop=None when stop < 0, without checking if the slice was originally empty (start == stop).
