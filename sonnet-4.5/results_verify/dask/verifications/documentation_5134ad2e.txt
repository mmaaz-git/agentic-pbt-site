## Documentation Analysis Report

### Source Code Documentation
The function `format_bytes` is documented in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/utils.py` at line 1771.

The docstring includes:
1. A clear description: "Format bytes as text"
2. Multiple usage examples showing expected outputs
3. **A specific guarantee at line 1788**: "For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters."

### Key Documentation Statement
The critical documentation statement is explicit and unambiguous:
```
For all values < 2**60, the output is always <= 10 characters.
```

This is a clear contract that:
- Applies to ALL values less than 2**60 (no exceptions mentioned)
- Guarantees the output string length will be at most 10 characters
- Makes this a testable property of the function

### Online Documentation
Web search confirms this function is part of the official Dask API (dask.utils module) and is used throughout the Dask ecosystem for displaying byte sizes in human-readable format.

### Implementation Details
The function uses binary prefixes (kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB) and formats numbers with 2 decimal places using f"{n / k:.2f} {prefix}B" format string.

### Documentation vs Implementation Mismatch
The documentation makes an explicit promise about output length that the implementation fails to honor for certain valid inputs. Specifically:
- Documentation claims: output <= 10 characters for all n < 2**60
- Reality: output is 11 characters for n in range [1000 * 2**50, 2**60)
- 2**60 = 1024 PiB, so values from 1000-1024 PiB produce 11-character outputs

### Conclusion
The documentation is clear and explicit about the 10-character guarantee. This is not a case of ambiguous or missing documentation. The function violates its documented contract.
