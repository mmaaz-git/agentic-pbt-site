# Bug Report: Integer Overflow in Cython.Utils.build_hex_version

## Summary
The `build_hex_version` function in `Cython.Utils` has an integer overflow bug when processing version strings with large numeric components in pre-release versions (alpha, beta, rc). The bug occurs when adding the release status value (0xA0, 0xB0, 0xC0) to a version component that is already large, causing the result to exceed 255 and be truncated in the final hex representation.

## Function Location
- **Module**: `Cython.Utils`
- **Function**: `build_hex_version`
- **File**: `/Cython/Utils.py`
- **Lines**: 594-621

## Bug Description
In line 614 of the function:
```python
digits[3] += release_status
```

The code adds the release status (which can be 0xA0=160, 0xB0=176, or 0xC0=192) directly to `digits[3]`. However, if `digits[3]` is already a large number (e.g., 200), the sum can exceed 255, causing an integer overflow when the value is later used in byte-wise hex construction.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The function parses version components into a `digits` array
2. For pre-release versions (a, b, rc), it sets a `release_status` value
3. It then adds this release status directly to `digits[3]`: `digits[3] += release_status`
4. When building the hex value, each digit is treated as a byte (0-255 range)
5. If `digits[3] + release_status > 255`, the overflow causes unexpected behavior

## Reproduction Cases

### Case 1: Alpha version overflow
```python
build_hex_version("1.0.0.200a1")
# Expected behavior: Should handle large version components gracefully
# Actual behavior: 200 + 0xA0(160) = 360, overflows byte boundary
```

### Case 2: Beta version overflow
```python
build_hex_version("1.0.0.100b1")
# 100 + 0xB0(176) = 276 > 255
```

### Case 3: Release candidate overflow
```python
build_hex_version("1.0.0.150rc1")
# 150 + 0xC0(192) = 342 > 255
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Reproducible**: Yes
- **Input legitimacy**: Yes - version strings with large components are valid per PEP 440
- **User impact**: Could affect real users who have libraries with large version numbers

## Properties Tested
Using property-based testing with Hypothesis, the following properties were verified:

1. **Valid hex format**: Function should always return valid 8-digit hex strings
2. **Component encoding**: Version components should be correctly encoded in their respective byte positions
3. **Release status encoding**: Pre-release status should be properly encoded without overflow
4. **Idempotence**: Multiple calls with same input should return same result

## Test Evidence
The bug was discovered through systematic property-based testing focusing on:
- Boundary value analysis (testing values near 255)
- Component overflow conditions
- Release status interaction with large version numbers

## Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: Version components should be handled gracefully regardless of size
- **Actual**: Large version components combined with release status cause integer overflow
- **Consequence**: Incorrect hex representation that doesn't match the intended version semantics

## Suggested Fix
The function should either:
1. Validate that `digits[3] + release_status <= 255` and raise an error if not
2. Use a different encoding scheme that can handle larger values
3. Document the limitation clearly if it's intentional

## Verification
This bug can be verified by:
1. Running the reproduction cases above
2. Checking that the resulting hex values have truncated last bytes
3. Confirming that the mathematical overflow occurs as described

## Classification
- **Bug Type**: Logic Error / Integer Overflow
- **Discovery Method**: Property-Based Testing
- **Confidence**: High - Clear mathematical overflow with reproducible cases
