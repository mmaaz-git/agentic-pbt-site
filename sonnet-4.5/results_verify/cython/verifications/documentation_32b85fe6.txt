## Documentation Analysis for resolve_depend

### Function Purpose
The `resolve_depend` function is an internal utility function in Cython.Build.Dependencies that resolves a single dependency path against a list of include directories. It's used as part of the build system to locate dependency files.

### Documentation Found
- **No explicit documentation**: The function has no docstring or explicit documentation comments.
- **Inferred from code**: The function is decorated with `@cached_function` for performance optimization.
- **Usage context**: Called by `resolve_depends` (plural) which processes lists of dependencies.

### Expected Behavior Based on Code
1. Takes two parameters:
   - `depend`: A dependency specification (expected to be a string path)
   - `include_dirs`: A tuple of directories to search

2. Returns:
   - `None` if the dependency is in angle brackets format `<...>`
   - A normalized path if the dependency file is found in any include directory
   - `None` if the dependency cannot be resolved

### Key Observations
- **No input validation documented**: There's no documentation about what happens with invalid inputs like empty strings, None values, or non-string types.
- **Angle bracket syntax**: The function treats dependencies wrapped in `<...>` specially by returning None immediately. This appears to be for system includes (similar to C's `#include <stdio.h>` syntax).
- **No error handling specified**: The documentation doesn't specify what exceptions might be raised or how errors are handled.

### Assumptions Made by the Code
The implementation assumes:
1. `depend` is a string with at least one character (accessing `depend[0]` and `depend[-1]`)
2. `include_dirs` is iterable
3. File system operations (`path_exists`, `join_path`) will handle their own errors

### Conclusion on Documentation
The function lacks explicit documentation about:
- Valid input types and ranges
- Error conditions and exceptions
- The meaning of the angle bracket syntax
- Whether empty strings are valid inputs

This is an internal utility function that appears to be designed for use within the Cython build system, not as a public API. The lack of input validation or documentation about edge cases suggests it expects well-formed inputs from its callers.
