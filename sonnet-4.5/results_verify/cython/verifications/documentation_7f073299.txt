DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Function Documentation

The `is_valid_tag` function has a docstring that states:
```
Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments
to functions creating generator expressions,
however they are not identifiers.

See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5552
```

## Purpose of the Function

Based on the code and GitHub issue #5552:
1. The function was created to handle a specific edge case where Cython generates internal argument names like '.0', '.1' for generator expressions
2. These names are invalid XML tag names and were causing crashes when lxml is installed
3. The function filters these out to prevent XML errors

## XML Specification

According to the W3C XML 1.0 specification:
- Valid XML tag names must start with: letters (A-Z, a-z), underscore (_), or colon (:)
- Tag names CANNOT start with: digits (0-9), punctuation (except underscore), or other characters
- This is a fundamental XML rule, not specific to any implementation

## Current Implementation Gap

The function only checks for one specific pattern (names starting with "." followed by digits) but doesn't validate against general XML naming rules. The docstring doesn't claim to validate all XML tag names - it only mentions the specific '.0' pattern issue.

However, the function is used as a general filter before calling XML TreeBuilder methods (lines 49, 53, 57 in DebugWriter.py), implying it should catch all invalid XML tag names.

## Conclusion

The documentation (docstring) accurately describes what the function currently does - it filters out '.0' style names. However, the function's usage context suggests it should be a more comprehensive XML tag validator, which is not documented or implemented.
