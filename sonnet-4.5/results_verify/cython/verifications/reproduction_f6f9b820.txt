# Reproduction of Bug Report

## Summary
I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The Cython.Tempita template parser accepts invalid conditional syntax without raising errors during parsing.

## Test Results

### 1. Duplicate else clauses
Tested template: `{{if x}}A{{else}}B{{else}}C{{endif}}`
- Expected: TemplateError during parsing
- Actual: Template created successfully
- When x=False: Returns 'B' (first else clause)
- When x=True: Returns 'A'
- Additional else clauses are silently ignored

### 2. elif after else
Tested template: `{{if x}}A{{else}}B{{elif y}}C{{endif}}`
- Expected: TemplateError during parsing (elif after else is invalid)
- Actual: Template created successfully
- The elif clause is never evaluated, regardless of y's value
- Always returns 'B' when x=False, 'A' when x=True

### 3. Multiple duplicate else clauses
Tested templates with 2-5 else clauses
- All templates parsed successfully without error
- Only the first else clause is ever executed
- Additional else clauses are silently ignored

## Code Confirmation
Found comment in source code at line 291 of _tempita.py:
```python
# @@: if/else/else gets through
```
This confirms the author was aware of the issue but had not fixed it.

## Analysis of parse_cond function
The `parse_cond` function doesn't track whether an else clause has already been seen. It simply collects all conditional parts without validation:
- No check for duplicate else clauses
- No check for elif after else
- All clauses are collected in a list and passed to the interpreter

During execution, the interpreter stops at the first matching clause, which masks the invalid syntax but doesn't prevent it from being accepted.

## Conclusion
The bug is confirmed as described. Templates with invalid conditional syntax (duplicate else, elif after else) are accepted by the parser when they should raise a TemplateError.
