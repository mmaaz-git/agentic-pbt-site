## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Execution

I successfully reproduced the reported bug by running both the Hypothesis property-based test and the simple reproduction code provided in the bug report.

#### Hypothesis Test Results:
- The test passed, confirming that the bug exists
- With `kwargs={'a': 0}`, a `bunch` object was created
- `hasattr(b, 'a')` returned `True`, showing the attribute is accessible
- `'a' in dir(b)` returned `False`, confirming the attribute is not listed in `dir()`

#### Simple Reproduction Results:
- Created `tempita.bunch(x=1, y=2, z=3)`
- All attributes (x, y, z) were accessible via dot notation (b.x, b.y, b.z)
- `hasattr()` returned `True` for all three attributes
- None of the attributes appeared in `dir(b)` output
- The `dir(b)` output showed only standard dict methods and dunder methods, but not the dynamically set attributes

### Source Code Analysis

Examining the `bunch` class implementation in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Tempita/_tempita.py` (lines 393-421):

1. `bunch` inherits from `dict`
2. It implements `__setattr__` to store attributes as dictionary items
3. It implements `__getattr__` to retrieve dictionary items as attributes
4. It does NOT implement `__dir__()` method

This means:
- Attributes are stored in the dictionary (accessible via `self[name]`)
- They are accessible via dot notation through `__getattr__`
- They are NOT reported by `dir()` because there's no custom `__dir__()` implementation
- The default `dir()` mechanism for dict subclasses doesn't include dictionary keys

### Confirmed Behavior

The bug report is accurate:
1. Dynamically set attributes on `bunch` instances are accessible via attribute access
2. These attributes return `True` for `hasattr()` checks
3. These attributes do NOT appear in `dir()` output
4. This violates the expected behavior where accessible attributes should be discoverable through `dir()`
