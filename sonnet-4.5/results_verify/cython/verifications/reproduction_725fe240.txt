BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

1. TEST CASE EXECUTION:
I successfully reproduced the bug using the provided test case.

INPUT: parse_list("a b # comment")
EXPECTED OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
ACTUAL OUTPUT: ['a', 'b', '#__Pyx_L1_']

The bug is confirmed - the function returns a substitution label '#__Pyx_L1_' instead of filtering out the comment.

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The issue occurs because of how parse_list interacts with strip_string_literals:

a) strip_string_literals("a b # comment") returns:
   - Stripped string: "a b #__Pyx_L1_"
   - Literals dict: {'__Pyx_L1_': ' comment'}

b) parse_list then splits this by spaces: ['a', 'b', '#__Pyx_L1_']

c) The unquote helper function only handles quoted strings from the literals dict,
   but '#__Pyx_L1_' is not a quoted string, so it's returned as-is

3. ADDITIONAL TEST CASES:
I also tested with list format:
INPUT: parse_list("[a, b] # comment")
OUTPUT: ['[a,', 'b]', '#__Pyx_L1_']

This shows the bug affects both space-separated and comma-separated list formats.

4. BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION:
The strip_string_literals function is working as designed - it replaces comments with
substitution labels. The issue is that parse_list doesn't filter out these comment
substitution labels that start with '#'.

5. TECHNICAL IMPACT:
When used in real Cython code for parsing distutils directives like:
```python
# distutils: libraries = foo bar  # explanation comment
```

The parse_list function would incorrectly return ['foo', 'bar', '#__Pyx_L1_']
instead of ['foo', 'bar'], potentially causing build issues if '#__Pyx_L1_'
is interpreted as a library name.

6. PROPOSED FIX VALIDATION:
The bug report's proposed fix to filter items starting with '#' would correctly
address this issue by removing comment substitution labels from the final result.

CONCLUSION:
The bug is real and reproducible. The function returns internal substitution labels
for comments instead of filtering them out, which is incorrect behavior for a parser
that should ignore comments.
