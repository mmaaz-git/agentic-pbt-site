## Bug Triage Analysis

### Category: BUG
**Reasons:**
- The function produces invalid output that cannot be parsed as a float
- The output violates the fundamental contract of producing a "string representation of a float value"
- The test suite explicitly validates that outputs can be converted back to float
- This is a clear logic error in the implementation, not a documentation issue

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The function accepts negative float strings as input, so it must handle them correctly
- The malformed output (minus sign in the middle of digits) is objectively wrong
- Even without explicit documentation, a function that normalizes float representations must produce valid float strings

### Category: WONTFIX (Considered but rejected)
**Could be argued if:**
- This was an extremely obscure edge case that would never occur in practice

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- Negative numbers with negative exponents are common in scientific computing
- The bug affects ALL negative numbers with negative exponents, not just edge cases
- Cython is used for numerical computing where such values are routine
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't introduce complexity

### Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Considered but rejected)
**Could be argued if:**
- The documentation explicitly stated the function only works with positive numbers

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't limit the function to positive numbers
- The function accepts negative inputs without error
- The bug produces invalid output, not just unexpected behavior
- The test suite expects outputs to be valid floats

### Category: FEATURE_REQUEST (Considered but rejected)
**Could be argued if:**
- Negative number support was never intended

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The function already accepts negative numbers
- It works correctly for negative numbers with positive exponents
- The issue is a bug in the implementation, not missing functionality
- The docstring says "float value" which includes negative floats

### Category: INVALID (Considered but rejected)
**Could be argued if:**
- The function was only meant for internal use with positive numbers
- The behavior was somehow intentional

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The output is objectively malformed (minus sign in wrong position)
- The function is tested to produce valid float strings
- The bug violates basic expectations for any float normalization function
- No reasonable interpretation could justify the current behavior

## Final Assessment

This is a clear **BUG** that should be fixed. The function has a logic error where `lstrip('0')` is called on the string before handling the negative sign, causing the minus to be orphaned when the leading zeros are removed.

The bug:
1. Affects a common use case (negative scientific notation with negative exponents)
2. Produces objectively invalid output
3. Has a clear root cause and straightforward fix
4. Violates the implicit contract of producing valid float strings

The proposed fix in the bug report correctly addresses the issue by:
1. Detecting and preserving the negative sign
2. Stripping leading zeros from the absolute value
3. Re-adding the negative sign at the end if needed

This should be tagged as BUG and fixed.
