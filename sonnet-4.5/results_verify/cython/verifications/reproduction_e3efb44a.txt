## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### Reproduction Steps and Results

1. **Located the function**: The `is_valid_tag` function is in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/DebugWriter.py` at lines 16-27.

2. **Confirmed the implementation**: The current implementation exactly matches what the bug report describes:
```python
def is_valid_tag(name):
    """
    Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments
    to functions creating generator expressions,
    however they are not identifiers.

    See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5552
    """
    if isinstance(name, EncodedString):
        if name.startswith(".") and name[1:].isdecimal():
            return False
    return True
```

3. **Reproduced the inconsistent behavior**:
   - `is_valid_tag(".0")` returns `True` (regular string)
   - `is_valid_tag(EncodedString(".0"))` returns `False` (EncodedString)

   This inconsistency was confirmed for multiple test inputs:
   - ".0", ".123", ".999", ".1", ".00" - all showed the same inconsistent behavior

4. **Hypothesis test confirmed failure**: The property-based test from the bug report correctly identifies the inconsistency, failing on all three explicit examples (.0, .123, .999).

### Impact

The function behaves differently based on the type of its input, even though both `str` and `EncodedString` represent the same logical value. This violates the principle of type transparency - the function should treat the same logical name identically regardless of whether it's wrapped in an EncodedString or not.

The function's docstring and referenced GitHub issue #5552 clearly indicate that names like '.0' are internal names used for generator expression arguments and should be considered invalid. However, the current implementation only filters these out when the input is an EncodedString, not when it's a regular string.

This is a genuine bug where the function fails to consistently implement its documented purpose.
