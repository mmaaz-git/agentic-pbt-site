TRIAGE ANALYSIS: Cython.Utils.normalise_float_repr Bug
=======================================================

## Considerations for Each Triage Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
- The function produces mathematically incorrect results (1192 instead of 0.0000001192092896)
- The test suite explicitly requires `float(result) == float(input)` which is violated
- The bug is 100% reproducible with specific inputs
- The incorrect behavior is not edge-case or obscure—it affects any float with negative exponent and sufficient mantissa digits
- The fix is straightforward and the bug report includes a correct fix
- The function is used internally by the Cython compiler for precision checking, making correctness critical

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug reproduces exactly as described
- The test suite confirms the expected behavior is violated
- Multiple independent test cases confirm the issue

### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
- Could argue that scientific notation with very small exponents is rare
- The function might be internal/private (though it is tested)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case—scientific notation is standard for small floats
- The bug produces results that are wrong by orders of magnitude (not minor precision issues)
- The function is actively used by the Cython compiler
- The bug can produce invalid float strings that cannot even be parsed
- The fix is simple and well-understood

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- None. The function already claims to support this functionality.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function already accepts scientific notation inputs
- The test suite already tests negative exponents
- This is fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new features

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could argue the documentation doesn't explicitly promise to handle all scientific notation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The test suite explicitly tests that values must be preserved
- The function already handles scientific notation, just incorrectly for some cases
- The docstring says it normalizes float values, which implies all valid float strings
- Changing documentation to say "doesn't work for some negative exponents" would be absurd

## Special Considerations

### Severity Assessment:
- **High severity**: Produces mathematically incorrect results
- **Wide impact**: Affects any float with negative exponent and long mantissa
- **Silent failure**: No error is raised; wrong values are returned silently
- **Compiler usage**: Used internally by Cython compiler for precision checking

### Quality of Bug Report:
- Excellent reproduction case
- Clear explanation of root cause
- Working fix provided
- Property-based test included
- Multiple failing examples demonstrated

### Fix Complexity:
- The fix is simple and localized
- The root cause is well understood (negative slice indexing issue)
- No architectural changes needed
- No API changes required

## Conclusion

This bug report should be triaged as **BUG**. It represents a clear correctness issue where the function produces mathematically incorrect results that violate its documented contract (through tests). The issue is not trivial, affects real use cases, and has a straightforward fix. The function's internal use by the Cython compiler for precision checking makes correctness especially important.
