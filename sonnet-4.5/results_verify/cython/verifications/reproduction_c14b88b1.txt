## Bug Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. Here are the technical details:

### 1. Direct Reproduction
The bug report's test case was confirmed:
- Input: `parse_list("[']")`
- Expected: Should handle gracefully (either return a result or raise a meaningful error)
- Actual: Raises `KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'`

### 2. Additional Test Cases Found
Through testing, I found multiple inputs that trigger the same issue:
- `"'"` → KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
- `[']` → KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
- `["]` → KeyError: ''
- Any string starting with an unmatched quote character

### 3. Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test confirmed that the function crashes on various inputs with incomplete quotes. The simplest failing case found was a single quote character: `"'"`.

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs due to the interaction between two functions:

a) `strip_string_literals()` processes incomplete quotes by treating everything after the opening quote as string content until EOF, creating a label like '__Pyx_L1_'

b) `unquote()` assumes any item starting with a quote is a properly formatted quoted string and tries to extract the label using `literal[1:-1]`, which results in the wrong key ('__Pyx_L1' instead of '__Pyx_L1_')

### 5. Bug Verification
The reported behavior is accurate:
- The function does crash with KeyError on incomplete quotes
- The error messages match what was reported
- The proposed fix would address the issue by checking for properly closed quotes

### 6. Impact Assessment
This is a real crash that occurs when parse_list receives input with unmatched quotes. The function does not gracefully handle malformed input and crashes with an unhelpful error message (KeyError) instead of providing meaningful feedback about the invalid input.
