## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be invalid if the documented behavior doesn't actually specify that command-line options should take precedence over extension options, or if the use of the `or` operator is intentional design. Additionally, since the module is deprecated, one could argue that its behavior is no longer guaranteed to match documentation.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The source code comments explicitly state that command-line options should be used first (lines 236-240, 256-262). The general Cython documentation also confirms command-line options should have highest precedence. The bug was successfully reproduced and demonstrates actual incorrect behavior that violates the documented precedence order.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The module is explicitly marked as deprecated with the note "Note that this module is deprecated. Use cythonize() instead." in line 6. Since users are directed to use the newer cythonize() method, fixing bugs in deprecated code might be considered unnecessary maintenance. The bug only affects users who haven't migrated to the recommended approach.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even deprecated modules should work correctly for users still using them. The bug causes incorrect behavior that could silently change build configurations, potentially leading to hard-to-debug issues. The fix is relatively simple (changing from `or` operator to proper None checks) and wouldn't require significant maintenance effort.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue that the documentation/comments should be updated to reflect the actual behavior of the code, warning users that falsy command-line values will be overridden by extension attributes. This would make the current behavior the "correct" behavior by documentation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation and inline comments clearly state the intended precedence order (command-line first, then extension). The code's behavior contradicts this documented intention. Changing the documentation to match the buggy behavior would be backwards and counterintuitive to standard option precedence patterns in build systems.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Proper handling of falsy values in option precedence could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The current code might have been written with the assumption that falsy values mean "not set," and adding support for explicitly set falsy values could be considered an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not requesting new functionality but rather correcting existing functionality to match documented behavior. The ability to set command-line options to 0 or False and have them take precedence is a reasonable expectation based on the documentation, not a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code demonstrably violates its own documented behavior. The inline comments explicitly state that command-line options should be used first, but the implementation using the `or` operator causes falsy command-line values to be ignored. This affects seven different options and could cause silent configuration errors. The bug is reproducible, clearly defined, and has a straightforward fix.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The module is deprecated, which might exempt it from bug fixes. Additionally, one could argue that using 0/False as command-line values is an edge case that most users wouldn't encounter, especially since the defaults are already 0/False.

## Overall consideration
After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate bug, but one that should likely be categorized as **WONTFIX** due to the deprecated status of the module.

The bug is technically valid - the code clearly violates its documented behavior by using the `or` operator which treats falsy values as "not set" rather than explicitly set values. The reproduction confirms that command-line options set to 0 or False are incorrectly overridden by extension attributes, contradicting both the inline comments and general Cython documentation about option precedence.

However, the most significant factor is that this module is explicitly deprecated. The docstring states "Note that this module is deprecated. Use cythonize() instead." This deprecation notice suggests that users should migrate to the newer approach rather than expecting continued maintenance of old_build_ext. While the bug is real and could cause issues for users still using the deprecated module, investing effort in fixing deprecated code that users are actively discouraged from using doesn't make practical sense. The proper solution for affected users is to migrate to the recommended cythonize() method rather than relying on fixes to deprecated functionality.
