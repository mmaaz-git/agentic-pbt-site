## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the findings:

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test from the report fails immediately with num=0, producing ".0" which incorrectly returns True when passed as a regular string.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: Running the exact reproduction code provided confirms the inconsistent behavior:
   - `is_valid_tag('.0')` returns `True` (incorrect based on docstring)
   - `is_valid_tag(EncodedString('.0'))` returns `False` (correct based on docstring)

3. **Extended Testing**: I tested multiple cases to understand the pattern:
   - Regular strings: ALL inputs return True regardless of pattern (no validation performed)
   - EncodedString instances: Correctly reject patterns matching `.<decimal>` like '.0', '.123', '.999'
   - Both handle non-decimal patterns correctly (e.g., '.a', '.1a' return True for both)

### Bug Confirmation

The bug is real and has the following characteristics:
- The function only performs the `.decimal` pattern check when the input is an `EncodedString`
- Regular strings bypass this validation entirely due to the `isinstance(name, EncodedString)` check on line 24
- This creates an inconsistency where the same logical value ('.0') is treated differently based on its type

### Impact

The function's docstring explicitly states that "Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments to functions creating generator expressions, however they are not identifiers." This means these names should be rejected as invalid tags, but the current implementation fails to do so for regular strings.

The bug could lead to incorrect validation in the debugging system where invalid internal names (like '.0') are incorrectly accepted as valid tags when passed as regular strings.
