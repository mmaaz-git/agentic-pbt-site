# Documentation Analysis for split_string_literal

## Function Purpose
Based on the source code comment and usage context:
- **Comment in function**: "# MSVC can't handle long string literals."
- **Purpose**: Split long C string literals into smaller chunks to work around MSVC compiler limitations
- **Usage**: Called from Code.py:1867 when generating C code for string constants

## Documentation Found
1. **In-code comment**: The only documentation is the single comment explaining why the function exists - to handle MSVC's limitation with long string literals.

2. **Function behavior** (from code analysis):
   - Takes a string `s` and an optional `limit` parameter (default 2000)
   - If string length < limit, returns unchanged
   - Otherwise, splits into chunks and joins with `""` (C string concatenation)
   - Special handling for backslashes to avoid breaking escape sequences

3. **No formal documentation found**:
   - No docstring on the function
   - No mention in Cython's official documentation
   - No specification of performance requirements or guarantees
   - No specification of how backslash sequences should be handled

## Key Observations

### Backslash Handling
The function has special logic for backslashes near chunk boundaries:
- Checks the last 4 characters before the split point for backslashes
- Adjusts the split point to avoid breaking escape sequences
- Has a while loop that moves the end point character by character when backslashes are found
- Includes a safeguard for strings of all backslashes

### Performance Characteristics
- **Not documented**: There is no documentation stating what the performance should be
- **Not specified**: No O(n) or O(nÂ²) guarantee is mentioned
- The function is an internal utility, not part of the public API

### Expected Behavior
Based on the code and usage:
1. The function should preserve the original string when chunks are concatenated
2. It should avoid breaking C escape sequences
3. It should produce valid C string literals

## Conclusion
The function is an internal utility with minimal documentation. There are no documented performance requirements or guarantees. The behavior with backslash-heavy strings is not explicitly specified beyond the need to handle escape sequences correctly.
