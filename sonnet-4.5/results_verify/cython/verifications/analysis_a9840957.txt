## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- No explicit documentation states encoding should be optional
- The test suite only tests with explicit encoding, suggesting this might be intentional

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The encoding parameter has a default value (None), which in Python strongly implies optional
- The class has `default_encoding = 'utf8'` which appears designed for this exact purpose
- The failure is a hard crash with TypeError, not a meaningful error message
- Basic Python convention is that default parameters should work

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Users can easily work around by specifying encoding='utf-8'
- The fix is trivial for users to implement in their code

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's the most basic use of the function
- The crash happens for ALL input files when encoding is not specified
- This completely breaks the default behavior of a public API method
- The workaround requires knowledge that isn't documented

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that automatic encoding detection is a new feature
- The current code technically "works" if you provide encoding

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The default parameter and class attribute suggest this was intended to work
- This isn't adding new functionality, it's fixing broken existing functionality
- The method signature already promises this should work (encoding=None default)

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could document that encoding is required despite the default parameter
- No current documentation explains the encoding requirement

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code structure strongly suggests the bug is in the implementation, not the docs
- The class has `default_encoding` that should be used but isn't
- Documenting "encoding is required" would be counterintuitive given the signature
- The fix to make the code work as expected is trivial and obvious

### Consideration for BUG
**Why this IS a BUG:**
1. **Clear implementation oversight:** The class has `default_encoding = 'utf8'` that should be used but isn't
2. **Method signature implies optional:** encoding=None strongly suggests it's optional
3. **Complete failure of basic use case:** The function is unusable without encoding specified
4. **Python 3 compatibility issue:** This appears to be a Python 2->3 migration bug where bytes/str handling wasn't updated
5. **Inconsistent with class design:** Other parts of Template use default_encoding correctly
6. **Hard crash instead of graceful handling:** TypeError from regex engine, not a meaningful error
7. **Fix is trivial and obvious:** Simply use the existing default_encoding when encoding=None

### Conclusion

This is clearly a BUG. The implementation doesn't match the obvious intent from the method signature and class design. The presence of `default_encoding` as a class attribute that isn't used in `from_filename` is strong evidence this is an implementation bug, not a design choice. The complete failure of the basic use case (calling without parameters) and the trivial fix further confirm this is a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
