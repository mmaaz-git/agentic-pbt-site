BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report.

TEST EXECUTION:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION TEST:
   - Created Extension with pyrex_include_dirs=["/legacy/path"] and cython_gdb=True
   - Expected: cython_gdb should be True
   - Actual: cython_gdb is False
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   - Ran property-based test with various combinations
   - Failed immediately on first example
   - Failure case: name='A', cython_value=True, pyrex_param='pyrex_include_dirs'
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   Looking at the source code (lines 40-64), the issue is clear:
   - When pyrex_* parameters are detected, the code converts them to cython_* in the kw dict
   - It then makes a recursive call to Extension.__init__()
   - However, it only passes explicitly named parameters and **kw to the recursive call
   - The cython_* parameters (like cython_gdb) are NOT included in the recursive call
   - They are not in kw (they were passed as named parameters)
   - They are not in the explicit parameter list (only no_c_in_traceback is)
   - Therefore, they get their default values in the recursive call

4. IMPACT:
   - Any user trying to migrate from pyrex to cython gradually by mixing parameters will lose their cython_* settings
   - This silently ignores user-specified configuration
   - The bug affects ALL cython_* specific parameters when ANY pyrex_* parameter is present

5. BUG VALIDITY:
   - The bug is technically correct and reproducible
   - The code behaves exactly as the bug report describes
   - The proposed fix would address the issue by ensuring cython_* parameters are passed through
