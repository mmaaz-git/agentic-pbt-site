## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Results
The bug was successfully reproduced using the provided test cases.

### Test Results

1. **Basic Reproduction Test**:
   - Command value set to: 0 (falsy)
   - Extension value set to: True
   - Result with 'or' operator: True
   - Expected result: 0 (command value should take precedence)
   - **Result: BUG CONFIRMED** - Command value was overridden by extension value

2. **Hypothesis-style Test**:
   - With ext_value=True: **FAILED** - Got True instead of expected 0
   - With ext_value=False: **PASSED** - Got 0 as expected

3. **All Affected Options Test**:
   All seven options that use the `or` pattern showed the same bug:
   - `cython_create_listing`: cmd=0, ext=1, result=1 (wrong)
   - `cython_line_directives`: cmd=0, ext=1, result=1 (wrong)
   - `no_c_in_traceback`: cmd=0, ext=1, result=1 (wrong)
   - `cython_cplus`: cmd=0, ext=1, result=1 (wrong)
   - `cython_gen_pxi`: cmd=0, ext=1, result=1 (wrong)
   - `cython_gdb`: cmd=False, ext=True, result=True (wrong)
   - `cython_compile_time_env`: cmd=None, ext={'TEST': 1}, result={'TEST': 1} (wrong)

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs in lines 223-234 of old_build_ext.py in the `cython_sources()` method. The code uses Python's `or` operator to merge command-line and extension options:

```python
create_listing = self.cython_create_listing or getattr(extension, 'cython_create_listing', 0)
```

The problem with this approach is that the `or` operator returns the first truthy value. When the command value is falsy (0, False, None), the expression evaluates to the extension value, even though the command value was explicitly set.

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected**: Command-line options should always take precedence over extension attributes, even when set to falsy values (0, False, None).

**Actual**: Falsy command-line values are ignored in favor of extension attributes due to the use of the `or` operator.

This violates the documented precedence rules where command-line options should override extension settings.
