BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function lacks formal documentation and docstrings, so one could argue that its behavior is undefined. The user might be using an internal test utility in an unintended way, and internal utilities don't necessarily need to handle all edge cases gracefully. Additionally, since this is in a Tests/Utils module, it might be considered internal code not meant for general use.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code contains an explicit comment stating "strip Options from new keys that might have been added" which directly describes the intended behavior that's failing. The bug occurs when the function attempts to do exactly what the comment says it should do. The error is not about undefined behavior but about a clear implementation mistake that violates basic Python iteration rules.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal test utility in Cython.Compiler.Tests.Utils, not a public API function. It might be considered too trivial since it only affects test infrastructure, not actual Cython compilation. The maintainers might argue that test utilities are low priority and this specific function might not even be actively used in the current test suite.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug causes a complete crash with RuntimeError, making the function entirely unusable for its stated purpose. It's not a minor issue or cosmetic problem - it's a fundamental implementation error that prevents the function from working at all. The fix is trivial (adding list() wrapper) and has no performance impact for test code.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue that the comment should be updated to warn users that the function doesn't actually work when new keys are added, or that documentation should be added explaining that this function has known limitations. The lack of any docstring could be seen as the real issue.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The existing comment correctly describes what the function is supposed to do - it just fails to do it due to a programming error. This is not a case where documentation is wrong or misleading; the implementation simply doesn't match the stated intent. Updating documentation to say "this crashes" would be avoiding fixing the actual bug.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Someone might argue that safely removing newly added keys during restoration is a new feature that wasn't originally supported, and the comment was aspirational rather than descriptive. The ability to handle dictionary modification during iteration could be seen as an enhancement request.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The comment explicitly states this is existing intended functionality ("strip Options from new keys that might have been added"), not a new feature. The code already attempts to implement this behavior but fails due to a bug. The issue is not about adding new capability but fixing broken existing code.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a textbook Python programming error - modifying a dictionary while iterating over it, which Python explicitly forbids with a RuntimeError. The function has a clear stated purpose (via comment) to remove newly added keys, but crashes when attempting to fulfill that purpose. The fix is straightforward and standard Python practice (creating a list copy before iteration). The bug makes the function completely unusable for its intended use case.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function is in an internal test utility module, not a public API, so strict bug standards might not apply. Since there's no formal documentation or specification, one could argue we can't definitively say the current behavior is "wrong" versus just "unfinished" or "limited". The fact that it's test infrastructure rather than core functionality might downgrade its importance.

## Overall Consideration

This is clearly a BUG that should be fixed. The analysis strongly supports this classification for three compelling reasons:

First, the code contains an explicit comment stating "strip Options from new keys that might have been added" which unambiguously declares the intended behavior. The function crashes with a RuntimeError when attempting to do exactly what this comment describes. This is not undefined behavior or a documentation issue - it's a clear case where implementation fails to match stated intent.

Second, the error is a fundamental Python programming mistake that every Python developer learns to avoid: modifying a dictionary while iterating over it. This is not a subtle edge case or complex interaction, but a basic violation of Python's iteration rules that Python itself catches and reports with a specific RuntimeError. The fix is the standard, universally accepted solution of creating a list copy before iteration.

Third, the bug renders the function completely unusable for its primary purpose. This isn't a minor glitch or cosmetic issue - the function crashes every single time it encounters the exact scenario it was designed to handle. The test utilities exist to ensure proper test isolation by cleaning up module state, and this bug prevents that critical functionality from working at all. Even though it's internal test infrastructure, broken test utilities can lead to flaky tests and hard-to-diagnose test failures, making this a legitimate issue worth fixing.
