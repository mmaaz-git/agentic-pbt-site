DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR TEMPITA IF/ELSE SYNTAX

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION EXAMINED:
   - Internal docstring in _tempita.py (lines 1-30)
   - External Tempita documentation from GitHub repository
   - PyPI documentation and related sources

2. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION SAYS:

   a) Basic Syntax Documentation:
      - States: "{{if x}}x{{elif y}}y{{else}}z{{endif}}"
      - Shows standard if/elif/else pattern
      - Examples show single else clause per if block

   b) Explicit Rules About Duplicate else:
      - NO explicit statement that duplicate else clauses are forbidden
      - NO explicit statement that duplicate else clauses are allowed
      - NO mention of how duplicate else clauses should be handled

   c) Implicit Expectations:
      - All examples show at most one else clause per if/elif/else block
      - The syntax pattern mimics Python's if/elif/else structure
      - Python explicitly forbids duplicate else clauses (SyntaxError)

3. COMPARISON WITH SIMILAR TEMPLATE ENGINES:
   - Jinja2: Raises error for duplicate else
   - Django Templates: Raises error for duplicate else
   - Most template engines follow Python's syntax rules

4. DEVELOPER AWARENESS:
   - Comment in source code (line 291): "# @@: if/else/else gets through"
   - The "@@:" prefix typically indicates a known issue or TODO
   - This suggests the developer knew duplicate else was allowed but shouldn't be

5. USER EXPECTATIONS:
   - Users familiar with Python would expect duplicate else to be an error
   - Users familiar with other templating languages would expect an error
   - The documentation shows syntax that mirrors Python, creating expectation of similar rules

6. DOCUMENTATION COMPLETENESS:
   - Documentation does not specify behavior for edge cases
   - No explicit statement about syntax validation rules
   - No mention of what constitutes valid vs invalid if/else structure

CONCLUSION:
While the documentation does not explicitly state that duplicate else clauses should be forbidden, the documented syntax pattern, examples, and comparison with Python's behavior (which Tempita mimics) strongly suggest that duplicate else clauses should not be allowed. The lack of explicit documentation about this edge case does not make the current behavior correct - it indicates incomplete documentation of expected behavior.
