DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR CYTHON.DISTUTILS.EXTENSION

After reviewing the source code and available documentation, here are my findings:

1. SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION:
   - The extension.py file has minimal inline documentation
   - The docstring states it "Provides a modified Extension class, that understands how to describe Pyrex extension modules in setup scripts"
   - There is a single inline comment: "Translate pyrex_X to cython_X for backwards compatibility"

2. PARAMETER BEHAVIOR:
   - The code is designed to handle backward compatibility with Pyrex by converting pyrex_* parameters to cython_* equivalents
   - When pyrex_* parameters are detected, the code converts them to cython_* versions in the kw dictionary
   - The Extension class supports various cython-specific parameters including cython_gdb, cython_include_dirs, cython_directives, etc.

3. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
   - The official Cython documentation does not explicitly specify what should happen when BOTH pyrex_* and cython_* parameters are provided
   - There is no documentation stating that cython_* parameters should be preserved when pyrex_* parameters are also present
   - The behavior when mixing both types of parameters is not defined in any documentation I could find

4. EXPECTED VS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
   - The documentation and code comments only mention "backwards compatibility" for translating pyrex_* to cython_*
   - There is no specification that mixing both parameter types should work in any particular way
   - The recursive call mechanism when pyrex options are present is not documented

5. CONCLUSION:
   The documentation does not clearly specify the expected behavior when both pyrex_* and cython_* parameters are provided simultaneously. This is an undocumented edge case.
