## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation

1. **Module Docstring**: The Tempita module's docstring (lines 1-30) documents the basic template syntax, including:
   - Expressions: `{{any expression}}`
   - Control flow: `{{if}}, {{for}}, {{endif}}, {{endfor}}`
   - Python blocks: `{{py:...}}`
   - Default values: `{{default var = default_value}}`
   - Comments: `{{# comment}}`

   **Notably absent**: There is NO mention of `{{def}}` and `{{enddef}}` directives in the module documentation.

2. **Error Behavior Documentation**: Line 29 states: "If there are syntax errors `TemplateError` will be raised."

### Code Implementation Reality

1. The code clearly supports `{{def}}` and `{{enddef}}` directives (parse_def function at line 907).
2. The statement_re regex (line 690) includes 'def ' as a recognized statement.
3. The single_statements list includes 'enddef' as a valid statement end marker.

### External Documentation

1. Web searches show that Tempita is a vendored templating library in Cython, originally from paste.util.template.
2. The {{def}} directive appears to be for defining template functions within templates.
3. No official documentation was found specifying the exact syntax requirements for {{def}} directives.

### Key Finding

The {{def}} functionality is an **undocumented feature** of the Tempita module within Cython. Since it's not documented:
- There's no specification of what constitutes valid vs. invalid syntax
- There's no documented error behavior for malformed {{def}} directives
- Users cannot be expected to know the correct syntax

### Implications

1. Since {{def}} is undocumented, any error behavior for malformed {{def}} directives is technically unspecified.
2. The current error ("Unexpected enddef") for "{{def }}" is reasonable given the lack of documentation.
3. The proposed IndexError fix would change undocumented behavior, which users shouldn't be relying on anyway.
