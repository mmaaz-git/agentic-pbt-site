## Documentation Analysis for Cache.cleanup_cache

### Findings

1. **No explicit documentation found**: The `cleanup_cache` method has no docstring and no inline comments explaining its intended behavior.

2. **No mention of LRU policy**: There is no documentation anywhere in the codebase that explicitly states whether the cache should follow an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy.

3. **Method signature**: The method accepts a `ratio` parameter (default 0.85) which appears to control how much of the cache to keep after cleanup (target is cache_size * ratio).

4. **Context clues from code structure**:
   - The cache stores compiled Cython files to avoid recompilation
   - Files are accessed via `lookup_cache` and `load_from_cache` methods
   - When loading from cache, the code explicitly updates access time: `os.utime(cached, None)` (lines 146, 151)
   - This suggests files are meant to track last access time for some purpose

5. **Implicit expectation**:
   - The fact that access times are explicitly updated when cache files are used strongly suggests the cache is intended to track "recently used" files
   - The sorting by `st_atime` (access time) in the cleanup method confirms this is meant to be time-based
   - The name "cache" itself typically implies keeping frequently/recently used items

6. **No specification of eviction order**: While the code tracks access times and uses them for cleanup, there is no documentation specifying whether old or new files should be removed first.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly specify the cache eviction policy. However, the code's behavior of:
1. Tracking and updating access times when cache entries are used
2. Using access time as the primary sorting criterion for cleanup
3. Being called a "cache" (which conventionally implies LRU behavior)

All strongly suggest that an LRU policy (removing least recently used items first) is the intended behavior, even though it's not explicitly documented. The current implementation doing the opposite appears to be a bug rather than intentional design.
