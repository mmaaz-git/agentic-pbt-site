## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The code might have been intentionally designed to let TypeError bubble up for internal errors in parse_token_definition since it's a private method. Some frameworks deliberately use TypeError for internal validation failures to distinguish them from user-facing errors.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code clearly intends to raise InvalidToken based on the explicit raise statements. The InvalidToken class has a well-defined signature requiring token_number and message. The bug causes TypeError instead of the intended InvalidToken, which breaks the exception hierarchy and prevents proper error handling.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal parsing method that should never receive invalid input in normal usage since the Lexicon constructor validates inputs before calling parse_token_definition. The error only occurs when users provide malformed token specifications, which could be considered user error. The TypeError still prevents the program from continuing incorrectly.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The error message from TypeError ("missing 1 required positional argument: 'message'") is completely unhelpful and doesn't tell users what's wrong with their token specification. The intended InvalidToken would provide clear messages like "Wrong number of items in token definition" or "Pattern is not an RE instance" that would help users fix their code.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to clarify that malformed token specifications result in TypeError rather than InvalidToken. This would set correct expectations about error handling.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code explicitly tries to raise InvalidToken exceptions with specific error messages. This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue. The documentation doesn't need to document bugs; the bugs need to be fixed.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding proper error handling with informative messages could be seen as a new feature to improve user experience when dealing with malformed input.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The code already attempts to provide proper error handling with InvalidToken. This is a bug fix, not a new feature. The feature (raising InvalidToken with helpful messages) already exists in the code but doesn't work due to the missing parameter.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code explicitly attempts to raise InvalidToken exceptions with descriptive messages but fails due to missing the required token_number parameter. This causes TypeError instead of the intended InvalidToken, breaking the exception hierarchy and providing unhelpful error messages. The fix is straightforward and makes the code work as clearly intended.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Very few reasons against this being a bug. The only argument might be that TypeError still prevents incorrect execution, but this is weak since the intended behavior is clearly different.

**Overall consideration**
This is clearly a BUG. The code explicitly tries to raise InvalidToken exceptions at three locations in parse_token_definition but fails because it doesn't pass the required token_number parameter. The InvalidToken class is specifically designed to format error messages with token numbers to help users identify which token in their specification list caused the problem. The current behavior (TypeError with an unhelpful message about missing arguments) is obviously not the intended behavior.

The proposed fix is correct and minimal: it adds token_number as a parameter to parse_token_definition, passes it from the calling method (which already has access to token_number), and uses it when raising InvalidToken. This makes the error handling work as originally intended, providing users with clear, helpful error messages that identify both which token caused the problem and what was wrong with it.

This is a textbook example of a simple programming error where a required parameter was forgotten, leading to broken exception handling. The bug degrades user experience significantly by replacing helpful validation messages with cryptic TypeError messages about the exception class itself.
