# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- One could argue that "odd" and "even" are arbitrary labels and the implementation defines them differently
- The lack of explicit docstrings in the code itself could mean the behavior is undefined

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- External documentation clearly states "The first item is even"
- Mathematical convention universally considers 0 to be even
- The property names "odd" and "even" have well-established meanings
- The behavior contradicts both documentation and common sense

**Verdict: NOT INVALID**

## Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- This could be considered a trivial issue if users can work around it
- The code has apparently existed this way for years in both original Tempita and Cython's fork
- Breaking changes might affect existing code that relies on the buggy behavior

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The properties return objectively incorrect values based on their names
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects every single use of these properties
- The fix is simple and the bug is clearly wrong
- Properties named "odd" and "even" that return the opposite values are fundamentally broken

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX**

## Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- If the code behavior was intentional, we could update docs to match the implementation
- The external documentation that says "the first item is even" could be wrong

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The mathematical definitions of odd and even are not negotiable
- Position 0 is mathematically even (0 % 2 == 0)
- Changing documentation to say "odd returns true for even positions" would be absurd
- The property names themselves establish the contract

**Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX**

## Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue that correct odd/even detection is a "new feature"
- The current implementation technically "works" (returns values), just incorrectly

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality
- The properties already exist; they just return wrong values
- A feature request would be for something that doesn't exist, not fixing something that's broken

**Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST**

## Considering BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Clear semantic violation**: Properties named "odd" and "even" return the opposite of their mathematical definitions
2. **Documentation mismatch**: External docs state "the first item is even" but the code makes position 0 odd
3. **Mathematical incorrectness**: 0 % 2 == 0, which is even by definition, but the code returns odd=True
4. **Type inconsistency**: The even property returns int (0/1) while odd returns bool, which is inconsistent
5. **Logic error**: The implementation has `not self.pos % 2` for odd, which inverts the correct logic
6. **User expectation violation**: Any reasonable user would expect odd/even to follow standard definitions
7. **Simple fix available**: The bug report provides a straightforward fix that corrects the logic

**Evidence it's a real bug:**
- The reproduction clearly shows position 0 returns odd=True when it should be even
- Standard mathematical convention defines 0 as even
- The property names establish an implicit contract about their behavior
- The inconsistent return types (bool vs int) suggest a coding error

**Verdict: THIS IS A BUG**

## Final Assessment
This is unequivocally a BUG. The odd and even properties return mathematically incorrect values that contradict:
1. Their own names
2. Mathematical conventions
3. Available documentation
4. User expectations
5. Common sense

The bug is not trivial, not a missing feature, and not a documentation issue. It's a clear logic error in the implementation that causes the properties to return the opposite of what they should. The fix is straightforward and corrects an objective error in the code.
