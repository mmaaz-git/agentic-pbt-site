## Documentation Analysis

### Official Pandas Documentation

Based on reviewing the official pandas documentation and testing:

1. **Pandas Series/DataFrame Behavior**: The pandas documentation explicitly states that for Series/DataFrame operations:
   - `sum()` returns 0 when all values are NA/missing
   - `prod()` returns 1 when all values are NA/missing
   - `min()` and `max()` return NaN when all values are NA/missing

2. **Internal masked_reductions Module**: The `masked_reductions` module is an internal implementation detail for handling masked arrays. The module docstring states it is "for reduction algorithms using a mask-based approach for missing values" but does not specify the exact behavior when all values are masked.

3. **Inconsistency Within the Module**: Testing reveals:
   - `sum()` and `prod()` return 0 and 1 respectively (identity elements)
   - `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `var()`, and `std()` return NA
   - This creates an internal inconsistency within the same module

4. **min_count Parameter**: The documentation for the `_reductions` function states:
   "min_count : int, default 0 - The required number of valid values to perform the operation. If fewer than min_count non-NA values are present the result will be NA."

   This parameter provides a way to return NA when there are insufficient values, and indeed when min_count=1 is specified with all masked values, both sum and prod correctly return NA.

### Key Observations

1. The high-level pandas Series/DataFrame API consistently returns identity elements (0 for sum, 1 for prod) when all values are NA, which is documented behavior.

2. However, the internal `masked_reductions` module shows inconsistency:
   - 5 out of 7 reduction functions (min, max, mean, var, std) return NA for all-masked arrays
   - Only sum and prod return identity elements

3. The module appears to be designed for internal use with masked arrays (like IntegerArray, FloatingArray) where consistency in handling all-NA cases would be expected.

4. The fact that `mean()`, `var()`, and `std()` explicitly check for `mask.all()` and return NA (lines 163, 176, 194) suggests this was an intentional design choice for those functions.

### Conclusion

While the high-level pandas API documents and expects sum/prod to return identity elements for all-NA data, the internal masked_reductions module shows inconsistent behavior between different reduction operations. This inconsistency within the module itself suggests a potential oversight rather than intentional design.
