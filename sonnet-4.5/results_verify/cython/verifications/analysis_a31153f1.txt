## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Why this should be a BUG:**
1. The `--cython-directives` option is explicitly defined in `user_options` as a command-line argument
2. When used as intended from command-line, it causes a crash with a confusing error message
3. Similar options like `cython-include-dirs` ARE properly parsed from string to their expected type
4. The code clearly expects `cython_directives` to be a dict (line 107: `directives = dict(self.cython_directives)`)
5. The implementation is incomplete - it handles None but not string values
6. Users cannot use a documented command-line option without the program crashing

**Strength: VERY HIGH** - This is a clear implementation bug where a command-line option doesn't work when used.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why this might be INVALID:**
1. Could argue that the option was never meant to be used directly from command-line
2. Maybe users should only set directives programmatically in setup.py

**Strength: VERY LOW** - The option is explicitly defined in `user_options` which are command-line options. It would make no sense to define it there if it wasn't meant to be used.

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why this might be WONTFIX:**
1. Could be considered an obscure feature that few people use
2. Workaround exists (set directives in setup.py code instead)
3. Has existed for a long time without many complaints

**Strength: LOW** - This is not an obscure edge case. It's a documented command-line option that crashes when used. The fact that workarounds exist doesn't excuse a broken feature.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why this might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could argue that parsing string directives is a new feature, not a bug fix
2. The current code never promised to parse strings

**Strength: LOW** - The option already exists in the interface. Making it actually work is fixing a bug, not adding a new feature.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why this might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Could remove the option from `user_options` and document that it shouldn't be used from command-line
2. Could document that the option doesn't work and provide workarounds

**Strength: LOW** - The code is broken, not the documentation. The fix should be in the code to make the option work as users would reasonably expect.

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code defines a command-line option that crashes when used. The implementation is incomplete - it handles the None case but not the string case that occurs when the option is actually used from command-line. The parallel option `cython-include-dirs` shows how string options should be parsed in `finalize_options()`. The proposed fix in the bug report is reasonable and follows the existing pattern in the codebase.
