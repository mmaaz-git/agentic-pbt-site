Documentation Analysis for parse_list Function
=============================================

The `parse_list` function in Cython.Build.Dependencies is used to parse list values from distutils directives in source code comments. Based on my investigation:

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION (from docstring):
   - The function includes a docstring with examples showing expected behavior
   - Examples show support for:
     * Empty strings returning empty list: parse_list("") -> []
     * Space-separated values: parse_list("a b c") -> ['a', 'b', 'c']
     * Bracket notation with commas: parse_list("[a, b, c]") -> ['a', 'b', 'c']
     * Quoted strings with spaces: parse_list('a " " b') -> ['a', ' ', 'b']
     * Quoted strings with commas: parse_list('[a, ",a", "a,", ",", ]') -> ['a', ',a', 'a,', ',']

2. USAGE CONTEXT:
   - The function is used by DistutilsInfo class to parse configuration values from comments
   - Used for parsing directives like: # distutils: libraries = foo bar
   - Supports both space-separated and bracket notation formats

3. NOTABLE OMISSIONS IN DOCUMENTATION:
   - The docstring does NOT show examples with empty quoted strings like [""]
   - There are no examples with single quotes vs double quotes
   - No explicit specification about handling edge cases like unclosed quotes
   - No documentation about what exceptions might be raised

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (from code):
   - Uses strip_string_literals() helper to normalize string literals
   - Creates placeholders like "__Pyx_L1_" for string literals
   - The unquote() nested function assumes quoted strings have their content in the literals dict

5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (inferred from examples):
   - Should parse valid Python-like list syntax
   - Should handle quoted strings to preserve spaces and special characters
   - Should work with both bracket notation [a, b] and space-separated notation

CRITICAL FINDING: The docstring examples do NOT include empty quoted strings ("" or '') as test cases. The documentation does not explicitly state whether empty quoted strings should be supported, though logically they should be valid string literals in Python-like syntax.
