## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Consideration for BUG:
**Arguments for:**
- The function returns duplicate paths when given different representations of the same file
- The function attempts deduplication with `set(rel_paths)` but fails to handle semantic duplicates
- The function name "normalize_existing" implies creating canonical representations, which typically includes deduplication
- Duplicate paths in the output serve no useful purpose and could cause issues in build systems
- The bug is reproducible and has a clear root cause

**Arguments against:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise deduplication
- The current behavior doesn't crash or produce incorrect builds in most cases

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments for:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state that duplicates should be removed
- The function technically does what the documentation says: it normalizes paths

**Arguments against:**
- The presence of `set(rel_paths)` shows intent to deduplicate
- Returning duplicates contradicts the normalization concept
- The bug is real and reproducible

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments for:**
- This might be considered an edge case that rarely occurs in practice
- Users typically don't mix relative and absolute paths to the same file

**Arguments against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - mixing relative and absolute paths is reasonable
- The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality
- Having duplicates could cause real issues in build systems

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments for:**
- The documentation could be clearer about duplicate handling

**Arguments against:**
- This is clearly a logic bug, not just a documentation issue
- The code attempts deduplication but fails

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments for:**
- Deduplication could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments against:**
- The function already attempts deduplication with `set(rel_paths)`
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

### Conclusion:
This is a **BUG**. The function:
1. Already attempts deduplication (showing intent)
2. Fails to properly deduplicate semantic duplicates
3. Returns duplicate paths that serve no purpose
4. Has "normalize" in its name, which implies canonical representation
5. Could cause issues in build systems that don't expect duplicates

The bug is not trivial, has a clear fix, and addresses a real problem in the code's logic.
