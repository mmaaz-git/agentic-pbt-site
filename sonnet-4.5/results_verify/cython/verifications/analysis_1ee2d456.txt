## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering: INVALID

**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The core claim is factually incorrect: `parse_default` is never called for `{{default }}` input
- The IndexError at line 881 cannot occur for this input because that code path is never executed
- The bug report misunderstands how the parser works
- The test case provided doesn't actually trigger the claimed bug
- The "reproduction" code doesn't reproduce an IndexError

**Why it might NOT be INVALID:**
- There could be some other input that triggers the issue (though not demonstrated)
- The fix might still be valuable as defensive programming

**Assessment:** This is the most likely classification. The bug report is based on incorrect analysis.

### Considering: WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Even if the issue existed, it's an edge case with malformed syntax
- Users shouldn't write `{{default }}` anyway - it's invalid syntax
- The current behavior (treating it as a variable) is reasonable

**Why it might NOT be WONTFIX:**
- The report claims a crash, which would be worth fixing if true
- Better error messages are generally valuable

**Assessment:** Less likely since the bug doesn't actually exist.

### Considering: FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be reframed as "provide better error messages for malformed default statements"
- The reporter wants `{{default }}` to raise TemplateError instead of being treated as a variable

**Why it might NOT be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The report specifically claims a bug (IndexError) that doesn't exist
- It's not asking for new functionality, but claiming existing functionality is broken

**Assessment:** Possible if we reinterpret the intent, but the report is clearly filed as a bug.

### Considering: DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be clearer about what happens with malformed syntax
- Could add examples of invalid syntax and expected behavior

**Why it might NOT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation correctly shows the syntax: `{{default var = default_value}}`
- The report isn't about documentation being wrong
- The actual behavior matches reasonable interpretation of the docs

**Assessment:** Unlikely, as the documentation is correct.

### Considering: BUG

**Why it might be BUG:**
- IF the parse_default function could somehow be reached with this input, it would crash
- The proposed fix would add defensive programming

**Why it might NOT be BUG:**
- The claimed crash doesn't happen
- The reproduction steps don't work
- The analysis in the report is incorrect
- The parse_default function is never called for the claimed input

**Assessment:** Not a bug because the claimed behavior doesn't occur.

### Final Assessment

This bug report should be classified as **INVALID** because:

1. The fundamental claim is incorrect - `parse_default` is never called for `{{default }}` input
2. The claimed IndexError does not occur
3. The reproduction code provided does not reproduce the claimed error
4. The parser correctly handles `{{default }}` by treating it as a variable expression
5. The test case fails for a different reason than claimed

The reporter misunderstood how the template parser tokenizes and processes input. While the proposed fix might add defensive programming to `parse_default`, it would never be executed for the input described in the bug report.
