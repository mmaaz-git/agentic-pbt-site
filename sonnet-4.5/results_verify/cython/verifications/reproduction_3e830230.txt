## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Confirmation
The bug report is technically accurate in its description:

1. **The reported case reproduces exactly**:
   - Input: `-9007199254740993`
   - Result: `-9007199254740992.0` (float)
   - Precision loss: Off by 1

2. **Root cause confirmed**:
   - The function uses `value.isdigit()` to detect integers
   - `isdigit()` returns False for negative numbers (due to the '-' sign)
   - Negative numbers fall through to `float(value)` conversion
   - Float has limited precision (53 bits for mantissa)
   - Large integers beyond 2^53 lose precision when converted to float

3. **Asymmetric behavior observed**:
   - Positive integers: Parsed as `int` type, preserving precision
   - Negative integers: Parsed as `float` type, losing precision for large values
   - Example: `9007199254740993` stays as int, `-9007199254740993` becomes float

4. **Float precision boundary**:
   - Float can exactly represent integers up to Â±2^53 (9007199254740992)
   - The test value -9007199254740993 is exactly 2^53 + 1
   - This explains why it loses precision (rounds to nearest representable float)

5. **Hypothesis testing confirms widespread issue**:
   - Multiple large negative integers fail to preserve their exact value
   - The issue affects any negative integer beyond float precision limits

### Technical Assessment

The bug report's technical analysis is correct:
1. The code path explanation is accurate
2. The precision loss for large negative integers is real
3. The proposed fix would technically address the issue

However, the critical question is whether this is truly a bug or expected behavior based on the documentation and intended use case.
