## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `_have_importers()` function has no explicit documentation (no docstring). It is an internal function (indicated by the leading underscore) used by the `install()` function.

### Purpose from Code Context
From analyzing the code and its usage:
1. The function is called by `install()` at line 434 to check if importers are already installed
2. It returns a tuple `(has_py_importer, has_pyx_importer)` indicating which importers are present
3. The `install()` function uses this information to avoid re-installing already installed importers

### Class Hierarchy Documentation
Neither `PyImportMetaFinder` nor `PyxImportMetaFinder` have docstrings. From the code:
- `PyxImportMetaFinder` (line 222) inherits from `MetaPathFinder`
- `PyImportMetaFinder` (line 256) also inherits from `MetaPathFinder`
- They are sibling classes, not in a parent-child relationship

### Implicit Expectations
The code structure suggests these expectations:
1. `PyxImportMetaFinder` handles .pyx files
2. `PyImportMetaFinder` handles .py files (for experimental Python compilation support)
3. Each should be detectable independently in `sys.meta_path`

### Documentation in Module Docstring
The module docstring mentions:
- "experimental compilation support for normal Python modules" (line 33-34)
- Installing with `pyximport.install(pyimport=True)` for .py support (line 42)
- No specific mention of how detection works internally

### Lack of Specification
There is no documentation that specifies:
1. How `_have_importers()` should detect the importers
2. Whether the nested isinstance check is intentional
3. Whether PyImportMetaFinder should be a subclass of PyxImportMetaFinder

### Conclusion
The lack of documentation means we must infer intent from:
1. The function name suggests it should detect "have importers" (plural)
2. The return value structure `(has_py_importer, has_pyx_importer)` suggests independent detection
3. The usage in `install()` treats them as independent checks
4. The class definitions show they are siblings, not parent-child

The current implementation appears to be a logic error rather than intentional behavior, as it fails to correctly detect PyImportMetaFinder when it's the only importer present.
