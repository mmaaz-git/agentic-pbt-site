## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible - `delattr()` does fail on `bunch` objects
- The class implements `__setattr__` and `__getattr__` but not `__delattr__`, creating an asymmetric API
- Python's attribute protocol typically expects all three methods to work together
- The error message is misleading (says attribute doesn't exist when it does)

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The documentation never claims that `delattr` should work
- The class is documented as "a dictionary that also lets you use attributes" - not as a full attribute-supporting object
- Could argue this is unspecified behavior

**Verdict**: Not INVALID - the behavior violates reasonable expectations of Python's attribute protocol

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- The `bunch` class has likely existed for years without `__delattr__` support
- Users can work around this by using dictionary methods: `del b['x']` or `b.pop('x')`
- The primary use case (passing options into templates) may not require deletion
- Adding `__delattr__` now could break existing code that depends on the current behavior

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is a clear inconsistency in the API
- The workaround (using dictionary methods) breaks the attribute abstraction
- The fix is trivial to implement

**Verdict**: Possible WONTFIX if the maintainers consider this unimportant for the intended use case

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The documentation never promised `delattr` support
- This could be seen as requesting new functionality rather than fixing broken functionality
- The class works as originally designed - it just doesn't include this particular feature

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is more of a bug than a missing feature - the class claims to support attributes but only partially does
- Python developers reasonably expect `delattr` to work when `setattr` works
- The error message suggests it's broken rather than intentionally unsupported

**Verdict**: Could be FEATURE_REQUEST if we consider this as adding new capability rather than fixing broken behavior

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could explicitly state that `delattr` is not supported
- The documentation could clarify that only partial attribute protocol is implemented
- Users would benefit from knowing this limitation upfront

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation
- Simply documenting the limitation doesn't fix the inconsistent API
- The error message from the code is misleading

**Verdict**: Not primarily a DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the issue is with the code implementation

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The class violates Python's principle of least surprise
- Implements 3 out of 4 standard attribute operations (create, read, update, but not delete)
- The error message is incorrect - it says the attribute doesn't exist when it clearly does
- This breaks compatibility with standard Python idioms and tools that expect full attribute protocol
- The implementation is inconsistent: you can `setattr(b, 'x', 1)` but not `delattr(b, 'x')`
- No documentation suggests this limitation is intentional

**Arguments against BUG:**
- Never explicitly promised to support `delattr`
- Has workarounds available (dictionary methods)
- May not be important for the primary use case

**Verdict**: Strong case for BUG - this is an incomplete and inconsistent implementation

### Final Assessment

This appears to be a **BUG**. While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise `delattr` support, the class implements a partial attribute protocol that violates Python conventions and developer expectations. When a class supports `setattr` and `getattr`, Python developers reasonably expect `delattr` to work as well. The misleading error message ("object has no attribute") when the attribute clearly exists further supports this being a bug rather than an intentional design choice.

The fact that this could alternatively be categorized as a FEATURE_REQUEST shows some ambiguity, but the principle of least surprise and Python's design philosophy suggest this is better classified as a BUG.
