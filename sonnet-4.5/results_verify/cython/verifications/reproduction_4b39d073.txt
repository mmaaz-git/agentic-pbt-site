Bug Reproduction Results
========================

## Test Execution

I successfully ran the reproduction code provided in the bug report. The tests confirm the technical details are accurate.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Bug Behavior Is Real
When command-level option is set to 0 and extension-level option is set to 1, the extension-level value wins:
- Command-level (builder.cython_gen_pxi): 0
- Extension-level (ext.cython_gen_pxi): 1
- Computed value: 1 (extension wins)

### 2. Root Cause Confirmed
The issue is in lines 223-234 of old_build_ext.py, which use patterns like:
```python
option_value = self.option or getattr(extension, 'option', 0)
```

With Python's `or` operator:
- `0 or 1` evaluates to `1`
- `False or True` evaluates to `True`
- The first "truthy" value wins, regardless of source

### 3. Affected Options
All these options exhibit the same behavior:
- cython_create_listing (line 223-224)
- cython_line_directives (line 225-226)
- no_c_in_traceback (line 227-228)
- cython_cplus (line 229-230)
- cython_gen_pxi (line 231)
- cython_gdb (line 232)

### 4. Modern build_ext Has Same Pattern
The current (non-deprecated) build_ext.py has the identical issue in get_extension_attr (line 81):
```python
return getattr(self, option_name) or getattr(extension, option_name, default)
```

### 5. Test Results Summary
- Property-based test: Correctly demonstrates the issue
- Reproduction code: Works as described, showing extension=1 overrides command=0
- All 6 affected options: Confirmed to have the same behavior
- Modern build_ext: Confirmed to have the same pattern

## Technical Accuracy

The bug report is **technically accurate**:
1. The code pattern does prevent command-level 0/False from overriding extension-level 1/True
2. The line numbers and code references are correct
3. The reproduction code runs and demonstrates the issue
4. The affected options list is complete and accurate

## Behavioral Interpretation

However, whether this is a "bug" or "intended behavior" is debatable:
- The code comments suggest command-line should take precedence
- But the implementation has used `or` operators since inception
- Both old and new implementations have the same pattern
- This might be intentional "any True wins" semantics for boolean flags
