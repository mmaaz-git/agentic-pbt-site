## Documentation Analysis for build_ext.get_extension_attr

After examining the Cython source code and available documentation:

1. **Function Purpose**: The `get_extension_attr` method is an internal method used to retrieve build options, checking both builder (command-line) and extension attributes.

2. **Official Documentation**: There is no explicit documentation for the `get_extension_attr` method itself in the official Cython documentation. This appears to be an internal implementation detail of the build_ext class.

3. **Code Comments Regarding Precedence**:
   - Lines 86-101 of build_ext.py contain comments about setting up include_path for the Cython compiler that state:
     "1. Start with the command line option."
     "2. Add in any (unique) paths from the extension cython_include_dirs"
     "3. Add in any (unique) paths from the extension include_dirs"

   - Lines 103-109 contain similar comments for compiler directives:
     "1. Start with the command line option."
     "2. Add in any (unique) entries from the extension cython_directives"

   These comments establish a clear precedence pattern where command-line options should take priority.

4. **Implementation Context**: The method is used throughout build_ext.build_extension() to determine various build options like:
   - cython_cplus (C++ mode)
   - cython_create_listing
   - cython_line_directives
   - cython_c_in_temp
   - cython_gen_pxi
   - cython_gdb
   - cython_compile_time_env

5. **Distutils Convention**: In Python's distutils/setuptools ecosystem, command-line options generally take precedence over setup.py configuration. This is a well-established convention where users can override build configuration via command-line flags.

6. **Boolean Options**: The options like `cython_cplus`, `cython_create_listing`, etc. are declared as boolean_options in the class definition (lines 52-55), suggesting they are intended to be boolean flags that can be explicitly set to False/0.

7. **No Documentation of "or" Behavior**: There is no documentation that explicitly states falsy values should be treated as "not set" and fall back to extension values. The use of `or` operator appears to be an implementation detail rather than documented behavior.
