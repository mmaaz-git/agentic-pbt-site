# Documentation Analysis

## Documentation Findings

### Official Cython Documentation
After reviewing the official Cython documentation, there is **no explicit specification** about how empty strings should be handled for the `cython_include_dirs` option. The documentation only mentions:
- The option exists as "path to the Cython include files"
- It accepts paths separated by the OS path separator (`:` on Unix, `;` on Windows)
- Multiple paths can be specified

### Implicit Expectations

#### From Code Context
1. The option is described as "path to the Cython include files" with the suffix indicating it accepts multiple paths separated by os.pathsep
2. When `None` is provided (default), it becomes `[]` after finalization
3. The option follows standard distutils patterns for include directories

#### From Similar Options
Looking at how distutils and setuptools handle similar path options:
- Empty paths are typically filtered out or treated as "no paths"
- The convention is that an empty configuration means "no directories to include"

### Command Line Usage
The bug report mentions usage like `--cython-include-dirs=''`. While not documented, the reasonable expectation would be:
- Passing an empty value should mean "no include directories"
- This should be equivalent to not specifying the option at all

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not specify:
1. How empty strings should be handled
2. Whether empty paths in a list of paths should be preserved
3. The expected behavior when `--cython-include-dirs=''` is passed

### Semantic Interpretation
Given the lack of explicit documentation, we must consider the most reasonable semantic interpretation:
- An empty string for a "directories" option logically means "no directories"
- Including an empty path `''` in the include path list serves no useful purpose
- The current behavior creates an inconsistency: `None` → `[]` but `''` → `['']`

## Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly define the behavior for empty strings. However, the most reasonable and consistent behavior would be to treat an empty string as "no include directories" (i.e., an empty list), not as "one include directory that is an empty string".
