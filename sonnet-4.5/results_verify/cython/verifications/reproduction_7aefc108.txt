## Bug Reproduction Results

### Bug Confirmation
The bug report is TECHNICALLY CORRECT. The Template.substitute() method does indeed mutate the input dictionary.

### Test Results

1. **Basic Mutation Test**: CONFIRMED
   - Input dict {'x': 42} becomes {'x': 42, '__template_name__': 'test.tmpl'}
   - The '__template_name__' key is added to the original dictionary

2. **Multiple Substitutions**: CONFIRMED
   - The mutation happens on first call
   - Subsequent calls with same dict don't add duplicate keys (key already exists)

3. **Namespace Mutation**: CONFIRMED WORSE BEHAVIOR
   - Not only is '__template_name__' added, but also ALL namespace keys
   - Input dict {'z': 'test'} becomes {'z': 'test', '__template_name__': None, 'default': 'value'}
   - This means the entire namespace is merged into the user's dictionary

4. **Property-Based Test**: FAILS AS REPORTED
   - The hypothesis test fails immediately
   - Any dictionary passed to substitute() gets mutated

### Code Analysis
Looking at the implementation (lines 182-185):
```python
ns = kw  # Creates an alias, not a copy
ns['__template_name__'] = self.name  # Mutates the original
if self.namespace:
    ns.update(self.namespace)  # Further mutations
```

### Comparison with string.Template
Python's standard string.Template.substitute() does NOT mutate the input dictionary. The documentation says Tempita is "like string.Template" which creates an expectation of similar behavior.

### Technical Impact
The mutation happens because:
1. Line 182 creates an alias (ns = kw) rather than a copy
2. All subsequent operations on 'ns' modify the original dictionary
3. This affects both single-argument dict and **kwargs forms

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as reported.
