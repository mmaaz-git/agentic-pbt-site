## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Arguments For:**
- The code contains a clear Python anti-pattern: modifying a dictionary while iterating over it
- This causes a predictable RuntimeError: "dictionary changed size during iteration"
- The bug is easily reproducible with the provided test case
- The fix is straightforward and well-understood in Python
- The function fails to accomplish its documented intent (removing newly added keys)
- This affects test isolation, which could cause flaky tests or test interference

**Arguments Against:**
- This is an internal test utility, not public API
- The bug might never manifest in actual Cython test suite if tests don't add new attributes

#### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue this is internal code not meant for external use
- The function might work fine for Cython's actual test suite usage patterns

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is real and demonstrable
- The code contains an objective Python error pattern
- The function cannot work as intended when new attributes are added

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- This is an internal test utility with limited impact
- Might not affect actual Cython test suite if they don't add new Options attributes
- Low severity since it's test infrastructure, not production code

**Arguments Against:**
- The fix is trivial (adding `list()`)
- The bug prevents the function from working as designed
- Could cause hard-to-debug test issues

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could document that the function doesn't handle new attributes

**Arguments Against:**
- The code comment clearly states the intent to remove new attributes
- The bug is in the implementation, not the documentation
- This is internal code without public documentation

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could reframe as "add support for removing newly added attributes"

**Arguments Against:**
- The function already attempts to do this - it's just broken
- The comment shows this was the original intent
- This is a bug fix, not a new feature

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code contains a well-known Python anti-pattern that causes a RuntimeError when the function is used as intended. The function's purpose (evident from its comment and usage) is to restore Options to a previous state, including removing newly added attributes. The current implementation fails to achieve this goal due to a programming error.

The bug is:
1. Objectively wrong (violates Python's rule about not modifying dicts during iteration)
2. Prevents the function from working as designed
3. Easy to fix with a one-line change
4. Has a clear reproduction case

While this is internal test infrastructure, it's still a legitimate bug that should be fixed to ensure proper test isolation in the Cython test suite.
