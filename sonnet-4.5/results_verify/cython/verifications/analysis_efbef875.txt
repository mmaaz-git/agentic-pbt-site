## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if the Tempita template system was never intended to support keyword arguments in template function calls, or if this is somehow expected behavior based on some undocumented design decision. However, there's no indication in the code or documentation that keyword arguments shouldn't be supported.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code clearly attempts to handle keyword arguments - there's explicit logic for processing them in lines 464-471. The parse_signature function returns data structures specifically designed to handle keyword arguments, including defaults and var_kw parameters. The error is a clear Python TypeError about using a list as a dictionary key, not an intentional error message about unsupported functionality.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be WONTFIX if template functions with keyword arguments are rarely used in practice and the maintainers don't consider it worth fixing. Perhaps the Tempita templating system is deprecated or in maintenance-only mode within Cython, and only critical security fixes are being applied.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a fundamental feature that's partially implemented but completely broken. The code shows clear intent to support keyword arguments, with dedicated parsing logic and data structures. The fix is trivial (one line change) and the current behavior crashes with any keyword argument usage, making an entire documented feature unusable.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the documentation incorrectly states that keyword arguments are supported when they were never fully implemented, this could be a documentation issue. The documentation could be updated to state that only positional arguments are supported in template function calls.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code structure clearly shows that keyword arguments were intended to work. The parsing logic exists, the data structures are in place, and there's even correct handling for positional arguments on line 479 that shows the intended pattern. This is clearly a coding error, not a documentation misunderstanding.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that proper keyword argument support was never fully implemented and this is requesting a new feature to complete the implementation. The current code might be considered a partial, non-functional stub that needs to be properly developed.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not adding new functionality - the code already attempts to handle keyword arguments and has all the necessary infrastructure. The bug is a simple typo where `sig_args` (a list) is used instead of `name` (a string) as a dictionary key. This is clearly a bug in existing functionality, not a request for something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is an unambiguous programming error where a list is incorrectly used as a dictionary key, causing a Python TypeError. The code on line 469 uses `values[sig_args] = value` where `sig_args` is a list, while the correct pattern shown on line 479 uses `values[name] = value`. This makes keyword arguments completely unusable despite clear intent to support them. The fix is trivial and obvious.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There are virtually no reasons this wouldn't be a bug. The only possible argument would be if this code path was never meant to be reached or if keyword arguments were intentionally left unimplemented, but the code structure contradicts this.

## Overall Consideration
This is unquestionably a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. **Clear Programming Error**: Line 469 contains an obvious typo where `values[sig_args] = value` attempts to use a list as a dictionary key. This is a fundamental Python error that will always raise TypeError. The variable `name` (from line 464) should be used instead, matching the pattern at line 479 for positional arguments.

2. **Feature Intent**: The code demonstrates clear intent to support keyword arguments. The `parse_signature` function parses them, `_parse_signature` has dedicated logic for handling them (lines 464-471), and the data structures are designed to accommodate them. This is not missing functionality but broken functionality.

3. **Impact and Fix**: The bug makes keyword arguments completely unusable in template functions - any attempt to use them causes an immediate crash. The fix is trivial (changing `sig_args` to `name` on one line) and follows the established pattern used for positional arguments. This is a textbook example of a simple but critical bug that should be fixed.
