BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Analyzing the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID - Why it might be invalid:
   - The code is working as designed (converts pyrex_* to cython_*)
   - No explicit documentation promises both parameter types work together

   Why it's NOT invalid:
   - The behavior is clearly broken - user parameters are silently lost
   - Backward compatibility should not break when mixing old and new parameter names
   - Silent data loss is never acceptable behavior
   - The comment says "translate" not "replace and ignore other parameters"

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be wontfix:
   - pyrex_* parameters are legacy/deprecated
   - Users could work around by using only cython_* parameters
   - Mixing both parameter types might be considered bad practice

   Why it's NOT wontfix:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - it affects all cython-specific configuration
   - Silent data loss is a serious issue, not a minor inconvenience
   - The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing behavior
   - Real users will encounter this when migrating from pyrex_* to cython_*

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be documentation:
   - The code comment mentions backward compatibility
   - Documentation could warn against mixing parameter types

   Why it's NOT just documentation:
   - The code behavior is objectively wrong - parameters are lost
   - No reasonable interpretation of "backward compatibility" includes data loss
   - The fix requires code changes, not just documentation updates

4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be a feature request:
   - Supporting mixed parameter types could be seen as a new feature

   Why it's NOT a feature request:
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capabilities
   - The parameters are already accepted by the function signature
   - Users reasonably expect passed parameters to be honored

5. BUG - Why this IS a bug:
   - Silent data loss: User-provided configuration is ignored without warning
   - Violates backward compatibility principles: Using legacy names shouldn't break new names
   - The recursive call is missing parameter forwarding - a clear coding error
   - The comment says "translate" but the code does "replace and discard"
   - The fix is straightforward: forward the cython_* parameters in the recursive call
   - This affects real-world usage when migrating code or mixing old and new code

CONCLUSION:
This is a clear BUG. The implementation fails to properly handle backward compatibility by silently discarding user-provided parameters. The recursive call on lines 47-63 is missing the cython_* parameters that were explicitly passed to the function, causing them to be lost. This is not a documentation issue or feature request - it's a logic error in the code that results in incorrect behavior.
