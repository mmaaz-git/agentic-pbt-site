## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### Test Case 1: 5.960464477539063e-08
- **Input**: 5.960464477539063e-08 (scientific notation for a very small positive number)
- **Expected**: The normalized representation should parse back to the same float value
- **Actual Result**: The function returns "596046447.00000007539063"
- **Error**: When parsed as float, this gives 596046447.0000001, which is ~10 billion times larger than the original value

### Test Case 2: -3.0929648190816446e-178
- **Input**: -3.0929648190816446e-178 (negative number with very large negative exponent)
- **Expected**: The normalized representation should parse back to the same float value
- **Actual Result**: The function returns a malformed string with 177 leading zeros followed by a misplaced minus sign: ".00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000-30929648190816446"
- **Error**: This string cannot be parsed as a valid float (ValueError)

### Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis
Running the property-based test with Hypothesis immediately found similar failures. The test failed on the first negative float with a large negative exponent it tried: -3.588683812854411e-96, producing a similarly unparseable result with a minus sign in the middle of the number.

### Root Cause
Looking at the source code (lines 679-685 in Cython/Utils.py), the bug is in the logic that handles the exponent:
1. The code doesn't properly handle negative exponents (numbers < 1)
2. For negative numbers, the minus sign gets placed incorrectly when reconstructing the string
3. The calculation of where to place the decimal point is incorrect for negative exponents

The function clearly has a logic error in handling scientific notation with negative exponents, producing outputs that either represent completely different values or cannot be parsed as floats at all.
