## Documentation Analysis for build_hex_version

### Function Documentation
The function `build_hex_version` has a docstring that states:
"Parse and translate public version identifier like '4.3a1' into the readable hex representation '0x040300A1' (like PY_VERSION_HEX)."

The docstring references PEP 440 for public version identifiers with a link: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers

### PEP 440 Requirements
According to PEP 440, public version identifiers must follow this format:
- `[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]`
- Must contain non-negative integers separated by dots
- Must not have leading/trailing whitespace
- Invalid versions should be ignored by installation tools
- Tools MAY warn users about non-compliant versions

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify
1. The function's docstring does not specify what happens with invalid input
2. The docstring does not list which inputs are considered valid or invalid
3. The docstring does not specify what exceptions might be raised
4. The docstring does not state that the function validates input according to PEP 440
5. The docstring only provides one example ('4.3a1') and does not clarify the full scope of supported formats

### Key Observations
- The function is described as parsing "public version identifier like '4.3a1'" - the use of "like" suggests it's an example, not a complete specification
- The reference to PEP 440 is informational (via "SEE:") rather than stating the function strictly implements PEP 440
- There is no contract specified for error handling or input validation
- The function appears to be an internal utility (in Cython.Utils) rather than a public API
