REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs in the `source_to_lineno` dictionary creation in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/Tests/TestLibCython.py` at line 24.

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Created and ran test script that demonstrates the issue
2. Verified the behavior with the actual codefile used by Cython tests
3. Confirmed the fundamental Python dictionary behavior that causes this issue

FINDINGS:

1. The actual `codefile` contains "pass" on lines 26, 29, and 33
2. The dictionary comprehension `{line.strip(): i for i, line in enumerate(f, 1)}` creates a mapping from stripped line content to line number
3. When duplicate lines exist (like "pass"), only the last occurrence is preserved in the dictionary
4. Testing confirms: `source_to_lineno['pass']` returns 33, losing lines 26 and 29

2. The bug report's example code correctly demonstrates the issue:
   - Creates sample code with "pass" on lines 2, 5, and 9
   - Shows that `source_to_lineno['pass']` only maps to line 9
   - The assertion correctly validates this behavior

3. The property-based test passes because it correctly describes the Python dictionary behavior - duplicate keys map to the last value.

IMPACT:
This bug affects two methods in test_libcython_in_gdb.py:
- `lineno_equals()` (line 84): Used to verify the current line number matches a source line
- `break_and_run()` (line 89): Used to set breakpoints on specific source lines

When these methods are called with a duplicate line like 'pass', they will always use the last occurrence's line number. This makes it impossible to set breakpoints on or verify execution at earlier occurrences of duplicate lines.

EXAMPLE IMPACT:
- Calling `break_and_run('pass')` will always set a breakpoint on line 33
- It's impossible to set breakpoints on the 'pass' statements at lines 26 or 29 using this method
- Tests that rely on specific 'pass' statement locations may behave unexpectedly
