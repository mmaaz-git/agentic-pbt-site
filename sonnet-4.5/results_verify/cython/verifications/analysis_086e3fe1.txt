BUG CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
===========================

Evaluating each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Function signature explicitly allows context=None as default
   - Function is part of the public API (no underscore prefix)
   - Function works correctly for built-in types with context=None
   - The crash is unintended - an AttributeError on None is clearly not the intended behavior
   - The fix is trivial and maintains backward compatibility
   - The function should gracefully handle its default parameter value

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - None identified

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None identified

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The bug is reproducible exactly as described
   - The analysis in the bug report is correct
   - The proposed fix resolves the issue

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could argue it's an edge case since the function is primarily used internally with context

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - Function is in the public API
   - Default parameter should work for all input types
   - The fix is simple and doesn't affect performance
   - Users may reasonably want to use this function standalone

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could argue that using safe_type without context for custom classes was never intended

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The function signature explicitly allows context=None
   - It works for built-in types, creating an inconsistent API
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could document that context is required for custom classes

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The code is broken, not the documentation
   - The function signature itself serves as documentation with context=None default
   - Fixing documentation to say "context required for custom classes" would be awkward
   - The code fix is cleaner than a documentation workaround

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is clearly a BUG. The function has a public API with context=None as the default parameter, but crashes with an AttributeError when called with custom class instances and the default context value. The function works correctly for built-in types with context=None, establishing that None should be a valid value. The proposed fix is minimal, correct, and maintains backward compatibility while fixing the crash.
