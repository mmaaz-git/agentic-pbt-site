## Documentation Analysis

### Python Standard Library Documentation
The Python standard library documentation for dataclasses clearly states that:
1. The Field class has a `kw_only` attribute (with underscore)
2. The field() function accepts a `kw_only` parameter
3. The attribute is consistently referred to as `kw_only` throughout the documentation

### Standard Library Implementation
Testing Python's standard dataclasses.Field shows:
- The repr output uses `kw_only=True` (with underscore)
- The attribute is accessed as `field.kw_only`
- This is consistent with the documented behavior

### Cython Documentation
The Cython documentation states:
- "Cython supports extension types that behave like the dataclasses defined in the Python 3.7+ standard library"
- This implies Cython's implementation should match the standard library's behavior
- No specific documentation found that would justify using "kwonly" instead of "kw_only"

### Python Conventions
Python conventions dictate that:
1. The __repr__ method should produce a string that, when possible, looks like a valid Python expression that could recreate the object
2. The repr should accurately reflect the object's attributes
3. Attribute names in repr should match the actual attribute names

### Conclusion
The documentation and Python conventions clearly support that:
1. The attribute should be named `kw_only` (which it is in Cython's code)
2. The repr should display it as `kw_only=` (which it doesn't - it shows `kwonly=`)
3. This inconsistency violates both the standard library's behavior and Python conventions
4. There is no documentation that would justify this deviation from the standard
