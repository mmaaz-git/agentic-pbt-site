# Bug Reproduction Report

## Bug Verified
I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report.

## Actual Code Location
The code is located at:
`/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libcython.py:957`

The current implementation matches exactly what the bug report states.

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Hypothesis Test
Ran the provided hypothesis test which PASSES (meaning it expects the bug to exist):
```python
@given(st.text(min_size=1, alphabet=st.characters(whitelist_categories=('Lu', 'Ll'))))
def test_complete_with_empty_word(funcname):
    word = ""
    text = f"cy break {funcname} "
    all_names = [funcname, "other_func", "another_func"]

    result = complete_unqualified_logic(text, word, all_names)

    assert funcname in result  # This assertion passes, confirming the bug
```

With `funcname="spam"` and `word=""`, the test confirms that "spam" is in the result.

### 2. Direct Bug Reproduction
Executed the exact code from the bug report:
```python
text = "cy break spam "
word = ""

seen = set(text[:-len(word)].split())
```

Output confirmed:
- `text[:-0]` evaluates to `''` (empty string), not `'cy break spam '`
- `seen` becomes `set()` (empty set)
- Result is `['spam', 'eggs', 'ham']` - includes "spam" which should be filtered out

## Python Slicing Behavior
The core issue is Python's slicing behavior:
- `text[:-0]` returns an empty string `''`, not the full string
- This is a well-known Python quirk where negative zero in slicing has special meaning
- When `word` is empty (len=0), `text[:-len(word)]` becomes `text[:-0]` which is empty

## Effect of the Bug
In a GDB debugging session using Cython:
1. User types: `cy break spam ` (with trailing space)
2. User presses TAB for completion
3. Expected: New function names excluding "spam"
4. Actual: "spam" appears again in the completion list

This creates a poor user experience where already-typed function names are suggested again, causing redundant and confusing completions.

## Confirmation
The bug is real and reproducible. The code logic fails for the specific case when `word` is empty due to Python's slice notation behavior with `[:-0]`.
