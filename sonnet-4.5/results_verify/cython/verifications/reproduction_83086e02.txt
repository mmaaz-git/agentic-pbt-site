## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the bug report. Here are the key findings:

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test correctly identifies the issue with the failing input `alternatives=['a', 'a']`. When running the test, it fails with the assertion error showing duplicates in the results.

2. **Simple Reproduction**: The simple test case with pattern `{test,test}.txt` confirms the bug. The extended_iglob function returns the same file path twice when brace expansion patterns contain repeated alternatives.

3. **Consistency Test**: I confirmed the inconsistent behavior between different code paths:
   - Brace expansion path (`{a,a}.txt`): Returns duplicates - same file appears twice
   - Recursive glob path (`**/a.txt`): Does NOT return duplicates due to the `seen` set

### Code Analysis

Looking at the source code in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py`:

- Lines 42-49: The brace expansion code path simply yields all results without any duplicate checking
- Lines 53-68: The `**/` recursive glob code path explicitly uses a `seen` set to prevent duplicates

The bug report is accurate. The function has inconsistent behavior where one code path (recursive glob) prevents duplicates while another (brace expansion) does not.

### Impact

This bug can cause issues when:
1. Programmatically generated patterns contain duplicate alternatives
2. Users accidentally specify the same pattern multiple times in brace expansion
3. The results are used in contexts where duplicates cause problems (e.g., compiling the same file multiple times)

The bug is real and reproducible.
