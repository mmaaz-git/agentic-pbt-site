## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
1. The code clearly contains a typo: `name[:3]` instead of `name[3:]`
2. The feature is completely broken - all py: prefixed variables overwrite each other
3. The documentation explicitly states the intended behavior, which the code violates
4. The same module correctly handles the identical syntax in templates (line 753)
5. This is a high-impact issue that makes the feature unusable

**This is the most likely category.** The evidence overwhelmingly shows this is a legitimate bug.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
1. The bug is real and reproducible
2. The test cases correctly identify the problem
3. The documentation supports the bug report's interpretation

**Not INVALID** - The bug report is accurate and well-documented.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
1. The fill_command function might be rarely used
2. Users could work around by not using py: prefix

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
1. This is a documented feature that's completely broken
2. The fix is trivial (change `[:3]` to `[3:]`)
3. It's not an edge case - it affects all uses of the py: prefix in command-line

**Not WONTFIX** - The bug is significant and the fix is simple.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. The py: prefix handling is already a documented feature
2. It works correctly in templates, just not in command-line arguments
3. This is fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new features

**Not FEATURE_REQUEST** - This is fixing a bug, not requesting new functionality.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Could argue the documentation should warn that py: doesn't work in command-line

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation is correct - the code is wrong
2. The template parsing shows the intended behavior matches the documentation
3. Changing docs to match the broken code would be backwards

**Not DOCUMENTATION_FIX** - The documentation is correct; the code needs fixing.

### Final Assessment
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The code contains an obvious typo that completely breaks a documented feature. The fix is trivial and correct.
