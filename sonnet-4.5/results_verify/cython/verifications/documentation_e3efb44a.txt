## Documentation Analysis for is_valid_tag

### Function Documentation
The function has a clear docstring that explains its purpose:
```python
"""
Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments
to functions creating generator expressions,
however they are not identifiers.

See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5552
"""
```

### GitHub Issue #5552 Context
From the referenced GitHub issue, I found that:
1. The issue was about Cython's `--gdb` debug mode failing when generator expressions have arguments with names like '.0'
2. When trying to generate debug XML information, lxml raises a `ValueError` because '.0' is considered an "Invalid tag name"
3. This happens because Cython uses ".0", ".1" etc. as internal argument names in generator expressions (similar to Python's internal iterator locals)
4. The solution was to filter out these invalid tag names from debug output to prevent XML validation errors

### EncodedString Documentation
EncodedString is a subclass of str that:
- Keeps track of the original encoding (None for unicode strings)
- Is used throughout Cython's compiler infrastructure
- Should be functionally equivalent to a regular string for most purposes

### Usage Context
The `is_valid_tag` function is used in three places within CythonDebugWriter:
1. `start()` method - filters tag names before starting XML elements
2. `end()` method - filters tag names before ending XML elements
3. `add_entry()` method - filters tag names before adding entries

All three usages are to prevent invalid XML tag names from being written to the debug output.

### Key Finding
**The documentation and GitHub issue clearly establish that names like '.0' should be filtered out (return False) regardless of input type.** The function's purpose is to identify and reject these invalid tag names to prevent XML errors. The current implementation only does this for EncodedString inputs, which is inconsistent with the documented purpose.

The function should treat '.0' as invalid whether it comes as a str or EncodedString, since both represent the same logical name that would cause XML validation errors.
