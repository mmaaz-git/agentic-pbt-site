DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
The function `length_of_indexer` has minimal documentation:
- Docstring (line 291-297): "Return the expected length of target[indexer]"
- Return type: int
- No additional details about behavior with negative steps

SEMANTIC EXPECTATIONS:
1. The function name is "length_of_indexer" - the term "length" in programming universally means a non-negative count
2. The docstring states it returns "the expected length of target[indexer]"
3. In Python, len() is the standard length function and ALWAYS returns non-negative integers
4. The return type is specified as "int" (not "int that could be negative")

PYTHON/NUMPY BEHAVIOR:
- Python's len() function always returns >= 0
- For any valid slice s and array a, len(a[s]) is always >= 0
- Negative steps in slices are well-defined and produce non-negative lengths
- Example: len(range(10)[::âˆ’1]) = 10, not -10

DOCUMENTATION IMPLICATIONS:
1. The documentation does not explicitly state "returns non-negative values", but:
   - The word "length" has a clear, universal meaning in programming
   - No reasonable programmer would expect a length function to return negative values
   - The function claims to return "expected length of target[indexer]" which should match len(target[indexer])

2. There is no documentation suggesting:
   - That negative values are valid returns
   - That the function behaves differently for negative steps
   - Any special interpretation of "length" that allows negatives

CONCLUSION:
While the documentation is minimal, it clearly states the function returns a "length", which by standard programming semantics must be non-negative. The current behavior of returning negative values for negative-step slices violates this basic expectation.
