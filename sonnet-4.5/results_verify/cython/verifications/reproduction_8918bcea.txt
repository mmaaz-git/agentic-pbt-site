BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

1. TEST SETUP:
Created two test cases:
a) Test 1: .pyxbld file with ONLY make_setup_args() defined (no make_ext)
b) Test 2: .pyxbld file with BOTH make_ext() and make_setup_args() defined

2. REPRODUCTION CODE:
The bug report's code was tested exactly as provided:
- Created a .pyx file with simple content: 'def hello(): return "world"'
- Created a .pyxbld file with only: 'def make_setup_args():\n    return {"script_args": ["--verbose"]}'
- Called pyximport.handle_special_build('example', pyx_file)

3. ACTUAL RESULTS:

Test 1 (only make_setup_args):
- FAILED with AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'sources'
- Error occurs at line 132 in pyximport.py: "for source in ext.sources"
- The error matches exactly what the bug report claimed

Test 2 (both make_ext and make_setup_args):
- SUCCEEDED without errors
- Returned valid Extension object and setup_args dict

4. ERROR ANALYSIS:
The crash occurs at lines 131-132 of pyximport.py:
```python
ext.sources = [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(special_build), source)
               for source in ext.sources]
```

This code unconditionally accesses ext.sources even when ext is None.

5. EXECUTION FLOW:
When only make_setup_args is defined:
- Line 112: ext = None (initialized)
- Lines 120-123: make_ext doesn't exist, so ext remains None
- Lines 124-128: make_setup_args exists and is called, setup_args gets the dict
- Line 129-130: assertion passes because setup_args is truthy (ext=None, setup_args={...})
- Lines 131-132: CRASH - tries to access ext.sources when ext is None

6. BUG CONFIRMATION:
The bug is 100% reproducible and matches the bug report exactly:
- The code crashes with AttributeError when .pyxbld defines only make_setup_args()
- The crash occurs at the exact line indicated in the bug report
- The proposed fix (checking "if ext:" before accessing ext.sources) would resolve the issue

7. IMPACT:
This is a real bug that prevents users from using a documented feature where they can define only make_setup_args() in their .pyxbld files to set compiler flags without needing to define a custom Extension.
