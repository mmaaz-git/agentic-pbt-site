## Documentation Findings for Cython.Utility.Field

### Official Documentation

Based on my search, Cython's dataclasses support is designed to be compatible with Python's standard library dataclasses module (Python 3.7+). The `kw_only` parameter is part of this compatibility.

### Python Standard Library Reference

The Python standard library dataclasses documentation shows that:
1. The parameter is named `kw_only` (with underscore) in the field() function
2. Field objects have a `kw_only` attribute (with underscore)
3. The naming convention throughout Python's dataclasses uses `kw_only` with underscore

### Cython Implementation

The Cython.Utility.Dataclasses module is a fallback implementation when the stdlib module isn't available, as stated in the source code comments:
- "This is the fallback dataclass code if the stdlib module isn't available."
- "It defines enough of the support types to be used with cdef classes"

### Naming Convention

Examining the source code at /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Utility/Dataclasses.py:
- Line 22: _DataclassParams includes "kw_only" in its fields (with underscore)
- Line 33: Field.__slots__ includes 'kw_only' (with underscore)
- Line 38, 52, 102, 112: All use `kw_only` (with underscore)
- Line 66: __repr__ format string uses 'kwonly' (WITHOUT underscore)

### Expected Behavior

Based on Python's dataclasses module and Cython's goal of compatibility:
1. The attribute should be named `kw_only` (with underscore)
2. The repr should display the attribute name consistently as `kw_only`
3. This maintains consistency with Python's standard library

### Documentation Verdict

While there is no explicit Cython documentation stating how Field.__repr__ should format the `kw_only` attribute, the principle of least surprise and consistency with:
1. The rest of the Cython Field implementation
2. Python's standard library dataclasses
3. The actual attribute name used throughout the code

All suggest that the repr should use `kw_only` with underscore, not `kwonly` without underscore.
