## Documentation Analysis for _parse_pattern

### Documentation Findings:

1. **No public documentation found**: The function `_parse_pattern` is prefixed with an underscore, indicating it's intended as an internal/private function. No public API documentation was found for this function.

2. **No docstring**: The function itself has no docstring explaining its expected behavior, input format, or error handling.

3. **Usage context**: The function is used internally in `TreeAssertVisitor.create_c_file_validator()` to parse patterns for C code assertions in test files. It's called on both patterns and antipatterns to extract start/end markers and the actual pattern to match.

4. **Expected format from tests**: Based on the existing unit tests in `Cython/Tests/TestTestUtils.py`, the expected format is:
   - Plain pattern: `"pattern"` → `(None, None, 'pattern')`
   - With start marker: `"/start/:pattern"` → `('start', None, 'pattern')`
   - With end marker: `":/end/pattern"` → `(None, 'end', 'pattern')`
   - With both: `"/start/:/end/pattern"` → `('start', 'end', 'pattern')`

5. **No error handling specification**: There is no documentation specifying what should happen with malformed patterns. The existing tests only cover well-formed patterns.

### Key Observations:

- The function is internal (underscore prefix)
- No specification exists for how to handle malformed input
- The existing tests suggest the function expects properly formatted patterns with matching delimiters
- The format allows escaped forward slashes using backslash (`(?<!\\)/` regex)

### Conclusion:

Without explicit documentation on error handling for malformed patterns, the current behavior (crashing) could be considered undefined behavior. However, since this is used in a testing framework where robustness is important, graceful error handling would be more appropriate than crashing.
