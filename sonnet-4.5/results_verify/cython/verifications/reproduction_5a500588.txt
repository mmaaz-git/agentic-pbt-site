## Bug Reproduction Report

### Test Results
I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. Here are the findings:

1. **With maxlen=0**:
   - Writing "hello" stores the entire string "hello" (5 characters)
   - No StringTruncated exception is raised
   - The value is NOT limited to 0 characters as would be expected

2. **With maxlen=1** (for comparison):
   - Writing "hello" correctly truncates to "h" (1 character)
   - StringTruncated exception IS raised as expected
   - The value is correctly limited to 1 character

3. **With maxlen=None**:
   - Writing "hello" stores the entire string (unlimited)
   - This is expected behavior for None

### Root Cause Confirmed
The bug exists exactly as described:
- The code uses `if self.maxlen:` to check whether to enforce the limit
- In Python, `0` is falsy, so when `maxlen=0`, the condition evaluates to False
- This causes the length check to be skipped entirely
- As a result, unlimited data can be written despite explicitly setting `maxlen=0`

### Falsy Value Test
I confirmed that both `0` and `None` are treated as falsy in the conditional:
- `maxlen=0`: Falsy → No length enforcement
- `maxlen=None`: Falsy → No length enforcement (intended)
- `maxlen=1`: Truthy → Length enforcement works

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected when maxlen=0:**
- Either immediately raise StringTruncated when any non-empty data is written
- Or accept the write but store empty string (truncated to 0 length)

**Actual behavior:**
- Accepts unlimited data without raising any exception
- Stores all data written, violating the 0-length constraint

The bug report is technically correct about the implementation issue.
