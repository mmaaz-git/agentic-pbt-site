## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if the Plex module was never intended to support state changes from Python code, and the .pxd file represents the actual intended interface. Perhaps the Python source is just reference code and the actual implementation was always meant to be C-only.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly describes `begin()` and `produce()` as public Scanner methods. The Begin action is documented as a core feature. The Python source clearly implements these as public methods. The bug prevents documented, core functionality from working.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be WONTFIX if Cython.Plex is a legacy or deprecated module that's no longer actively maintained, or if state management is considered an advanced feature that few users need. The module might be intended only for simple, single-state scanners.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
State management is fundamental to lexical analysis - it's not a trivial edge case. The Begin action is prominently documented. The fix appears straightforward (change the .pxd declarations from `cdef inline` to `def`). This completely breaks a documented core feature.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the .pxd file represents the actual intended interface and these methods were never meant to be Python-callable, then the documentation should be updated to remove references to `scanner.begin()` and the Begin action. The Scanner class docstring incorrectly lists these as available methods.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The Python source code clearly implements these as public methods with `def`, not `cdef`. The mismatch is between the .pxd and .py files, not between documentation and intended behavior. The documentation accurately describes what the Python code implements.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that exposing `begin()` and `produce()` to Python is a new feature request, since the compiled module never had them accessible. Adding Python accessibility to C-only methods could be seen as an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not requesting new functionality - the methods already exist in the Python source with `def` declarations. The documentation already describes them as public methods. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is clearly a bug because: (1) The documentation explicitly lists `begin()` and `produce()` as public Scanner methods, (2) The Python source implements them as public methods with `def`, (3) The Begin action class relies on calling `scanner.begin()`, (4) The mismatch between .py and .pxd files is clearly unintentional, (5) Core documented functionality is completely broken, (6) There's no workaround for state management.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if the .pxd file was intentionally designed to hide these methods and the Python source/documentation were never updated to reflect this design decision.

## Overall Consideration

This is unquestionably a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming:

First, the Scanner class documentation explicitly lists both `begin(state_name)` and `produce(value [, text])` as public methods. The Lexicon documentation describes two ways to change states, including "Calling the begin(state_name) method of the Scanner." These are not mentioned as internal or deprecated - they're presented as core features.

Second, the Python source code (Scanners.py) implements both methods as regular Python methods using `def`, not as Cython-only `cdef` methods. The implementation is complete and functional. The only reason they're not accessible is the mismatch with the .pxd declaration file, which marks them as `cdef inline`. This is clearly a mistake in the .pxd file, not intentional design.

Third, the bug completely breaks a fundamental feature. State management is essential for lexical analysis - many real-world lexers require multiple states (e.g., for string literals, comments, different contexts). Without `begin()`, the entire state management system is unusable. The Begin action crashes immediately, making it impossible to build multi-state scanners. This is not an edge case or minor issue - it's a complete failure of core documented functionality with no possible workaround.
