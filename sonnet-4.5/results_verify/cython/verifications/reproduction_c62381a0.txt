REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

## Bug Verification

I successfully reproduced the reported bug in Cython.Utility.Dataclasses.Field.__repr__.

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The provided property-based test failed as expected:
   - When running with `kw_only_value=False`, the test fails
   - The assertion error shows: Expected 'kw_only=False' in repr, but got a repr containing 'kwonly=False' instead
   - The test correctly identifies that the repr uses 'kwonly' without underscore while the attribute is 'kw_only' with underscore

2. **Manual Reproduction**: The manual test case confirmed the issue:
   - Creating a field with `kw_only=True`
   - Accessing `f.kw_only` returns True (attribute exists with underscore)
   - But `repr(f)` shows 'kwonly=True' (without underscore)

### Code Analysis:

Examining the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Utility/Dataclasses.py`:

1. Line 33: `__slots__` defines 'kw_only' with underscore
2. Line 52: The attribute is set as `self.kw_only = kw_only`
3. Line 102: The field() function accepts 'kw_only' parameter with underscore
4. Line 66: The __repr__ method incorrectly formats it as 'kwonly={!r}' without underscore
5. Line 70: The formatting uses `self.kw_only` but labels it as 'kwonly'

## Impact:

This is a clear inconsistency between:
- The actual attribute name: `kw_only` (used everywhere in the code)
- The repr display name: `kwonly` (incorrectly shown without underscore)

This creates confusion when debugging as the repr suggests a different attribute name than what actually exists on the object. The repr should accurately reflect the object's actual attributes.
