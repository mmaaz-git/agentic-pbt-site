## Documentation Analysis

I examined the documentation for the `chars_to_ranges` function and related functions in Cython.Plex.Regexps:

### Function Documentation

1. **`chars_to_ranges(s)` docstring** (lines 29-33):
   ```
   Return a list of character codes consisting of pairs
   [code1a, code1b, code2a, code2b,...] which cover all
   the characters in |s|.
   ```
   This clearly states the function should return ranges that "cover all the characters in |s|" - meaning it should cover EXACTLY the characters present in the input string, no more, no less.

2. **`Any(s)` docstring** (lines 433-435):
   ```
   Any(s) is an RE which matches any character in the string |s|.
   ```
   This explicitly states it should match "any character IN the string |s|" - not any additional characters.

3. **`AnyBut(s)` docstring** (lines 442-445):
   ```
   AnyBut(s) is an RE which matches any character (including
   newline) which is not in the string |s|.
   ```
   This function also relies on `chars_to_ranges` and would be affected by the bug.

### Documentation Verdict

The documentation is clear and unambiguous:
- `chars_to_ranges` should return ranges covering exactly the characters in the input
- `Any()` should match only characters present in its input string
- The current behavior (including extra characters when duplicates are present) violates the documented contract

There is no ambiguity in the documentation that would suggest the current behavior is intentional or acceptable. The function is not behaving according to its specification.
