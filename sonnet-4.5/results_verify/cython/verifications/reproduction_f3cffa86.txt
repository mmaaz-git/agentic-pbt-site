BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=========================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported for Cython.Plex.Range() function.

MANUAL REPRODUCTION:
- Tested Range('abc') with odd-length string (length 3)
- Result: IndexError: string index out of range at line 475 in Regexps.py
- The error occurs exactly as described in the bug report
- Stack trace matches the reported behavior

HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
- Ran the provided property-based test
- Test failed on first odd-length input (s='0')
- The test expects ValueError with "even length" message but gets IndexError instead
- This confirms the bug: the function crashes with an unhelpful error rather than validating input

VERIFICATION OF NORMAL OPERATION:
- Tested Range('abcd') with even-length string (length 4)
- Function works correctly, returns an object with 'nullable' attribute
- Confirms the function works as intended for valid inputs

SOURCE CODE EXAMINATION:
- Located the actual function at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Plex/Regexps.py
- Line 474: for i in range(0, len(s1), 2): - iterates by 2
- Line 475: ranges.append(CodeRange(ord(s1[i]), ord(s1[i + 1]) + 1)) - accesses s1[i+1]
- When len(s1) is odd, the last iteration tries to access s1[i+1] which is out of bounds
- No input validation is performed before the loop

CONCLUSION:
The bug is confirmed. The function crashes with IndexError when given odd-length strings instead of providing a helpful error message about the even-length requirement documented in the docstring.
