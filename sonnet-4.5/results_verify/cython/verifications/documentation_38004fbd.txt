## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The function `is_valid_tag` has inline documentation (docstring) that states:
```
Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments
to functions creating generator expressions,
however they are not identifiers.

See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5552
```

### Purpose Based on GitHub Issue #5552
The GitHub issue reveals the function was created to address a specific bug where Cython would crash when compiling generator expressions with the `--gdb` debug flag when lxml was installed. The issue was that Cython uses internal names like '.0' for arguments to generator expressions, and these would be passed as XML tag names causing crashes.

### XML Specification Requirements
According to the W3C XML specification, valid element names must:
- Start with a letter (A-Z, a-z), underscore (_), or colon (:) - NOT digits or other characters
- Subsequent characters can include letters, digits, hyphens, periods, underscores, colons
- Cannot contain spaces
- Cannot be empty

### Current Function Behavior vs. Requirements
The function currently:
1. Only checks for one specific pattern: EncodedStrings starting with "." followed by decimals
2. Returns `True` for ALL other inputs (including empty strings, digits, spaces, etc.)

The function is used as a filter before passing tag names to XML TreeBuilder in three places:
- `start()` method - line 49-50
- `end()` method - line 53-54
- `add_entry()` method - line 57-59

### Implicit Contract
Given its name "is_valid_tag" and its usage as a validation filter before XML operations, the function has an implicit contract to validate whether a name is a valid XML tag. The current implementation fails this contract by only checking one specific invalid pattern while allowing many other invalid XML tag names through.
