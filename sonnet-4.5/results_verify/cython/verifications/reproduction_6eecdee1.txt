## Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report using both test approaches provided.

### Test 1: Simplified Hypothesis Test
- Created 3 files of 200 bytes each (total 600 bytes)
- Cache size was set to 500 bytes
- Files were created in order: file0.txt, file1.txt, file2.txt
- After cleanup with ratio=0.5, only file0.txt (the OLDEST file) remained
- The newest file (file2.txt) was deleted

Output:
```
Total size: 600 bytes, Cache size: 500 bytes
Files before cleanup: ['file0.txt', 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt']
Files after cleanup: ['file0.txt']
Oldest file: file0.txt
Newest file: file2.txt
Is newest file in remaining? False
Is oldest file in remaining? True
```

### Test 2: Bug Report's Reproduction Code
- Created 3 files in order: old.txt, new.txt, newest.txt (with 0.1s delays between)
- Each file was 200 bytes (total 600 bytes)
- Cache size was 500 bytes
- After cleanup, only old.txt remained while newest.txt was deleted

Output:
```
Files before cleanup: ['new.txt', 'newest.txt', 'old.txt']
Files after cleanup: ['old.txt']
BUG CONFIRMED: Oldest file kept, newest file removed (opposite of LRU)
```

### Conclusion
Both tests confirm the bug: The cache cleanup is removing the most recently accessed files instead of the least recently accessed files. This is the opposite of what an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache should do. The behavior is consistent and reproducible.
