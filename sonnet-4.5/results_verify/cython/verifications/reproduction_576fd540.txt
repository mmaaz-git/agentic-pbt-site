BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

TEST EXECUTION RESULTS:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION TEST:
   Input: ensure_python_int(float('inf'))
   Expected (per bug report): TypeError with message "Wrong type <class 'float'> for value inf"
   Actual: OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer

   CONFIRMED: The function does raise OverflowError instead of TypeError for infinity values.

2. NEGATIVE INFINITY TEST:
   Input: ensure_python_int(float('-inf'))
   Result: OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer

   CONFIRMED: Same behavior for negative infinity.

3. NAN TEST:
   Input: ensure_python_int(float('nan'))
   Result: TypeError: Wrong type <class 'float'> for value nan

   This correctly raises TypeError as documented, because NaN fails the assertion check (NaN != int(NaN)).

4. VALID FLOAT TEST:
   Input: ensure_python_int(5.0)
   Result: 5 (type: int)

   Works correctly for floats that exactly equal an integer value.

5. INVALID FLOAT TEST:
   Input: ensure_python_int(5.5)
   Result: TypeError: Wrong type <class 'float'> for value 5.5

   Correctly raises TypeError for floats that don't equal an integer.

6. PYTHON'S int() BEHAVIOR:
   Input: int(float('inf'))
   Result: OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer

   This confirms that Python's built-in int() function raises OverflowError for infinity values.

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
The hypothesis test confirmed that:
- For infinity values (both positive and negative), the function raises OverflowError instead of the expected TypeError
- For NaN values, the function correctly raises TypeError
- The test framework detected these as errors in the expected behavior

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
The bug occurs because:
1. The function calls int(value) on line 116
2. When value is float('inf'), Python's int() raises OverflowError
3. The except clause on line 118 only catches (TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError)
4. OverflowError is not caught, so it propagates up unchanged
5. This violates the docstring contract that states only TypeError should be raised

The bug report is technically accurate in its description of the problem.
