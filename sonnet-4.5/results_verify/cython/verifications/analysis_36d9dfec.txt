## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that empty local variable sets will be handled gracefully
- One could argue that calling `max()` on an empty sequence is expected Python behavior

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The crash occurs in a debugging tool that should handle all valid program states
- A function with no local variables is perfectly valid Cython code
- The sibling method `CyGlobals` handles the same situation correctly
- The error is not about invalid input but about a missing guard in the implementation

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The bug is marked as "Low" severity in the report
- Functions with no local variables might be considered rare
- The error message is clear about what went wrong

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - functions with no locals are legitimate
- The fix is trivial (2-3 lines of code)
- The inconsistency with `CyGlobals` suggests this is unintentional
- A debugging tool crashing reduces developer productivity

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue that handling empty locals is a new feature
- The original implementation might not have considered this case

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The command already exists and is supposed to "list locals"
- The expected behavior (handling empty sets) is standard for similar tools
- The sibling class already implements this "feature"

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to warn about this limitation
- The documentation doesn't specify the behavior for empty locals

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code is clearly buggy (crashes on valid input)
- The sibling method shows the correct implementation pattern
- Documenting a crash as expected behavior would be poor practice
- The fix belongs in the code, not the documentation

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Crashes on valid input**: A function with no local variables is valid Cython code
2. **Inconsistent implementation**: `CyGlobals.invoke` handles empty dictionaries correctly, but `CyLocals.invoke` does not
3. **Violates debugging tool expectations**: Debugging commands should handle all valid program states gracefully
4. **Clear fix available**: The bug report provides a simple, correct fix
5. **Unintended behavior**: The crash appears to be an oversight, not a design decision
6. **Real-world impact**: While marked as "Low" severity, it still causes the debugger to crash in legitimate scenarios

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The code crashes when encountering a valid program state (a function with no local variables), the fix is straightforward, and a sibling method demonstrates the correct implementation pattern. The inconsistency between `CyLocals` and `CyGlobals` strongly suggests this is an oversight rather than intentional behavior.
