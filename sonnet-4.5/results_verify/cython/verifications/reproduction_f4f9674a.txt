REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported for Cython.Tempita._tempita.TemplateDef._parse_signature.

Test Results:
-------------
1. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - Code: Template with {{def myfunc(x, y)}}{{x}},{{y}}{{enddef}}{{myfunc(x=1, y=2)}}
   - Result: CRASHED with "TypeError: unhashable type: 'list' at line 1 column 44"
   - Expected: Should output "1,2"

2. Property-Based Test:
   - The property test using Hypothesis crashed before even reaching the template execution
   - The crash occurs consistently for any keyword argument usage

3. Source Code Verification:
   - Located the bug at line 469 of /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Tempita/_tempita.py
   - The line reads: values[sig_args] = value
   - Debug analysis confirms sig_args is a list (e.g., ['x', 'y']) which cannot be used as a dictionary key

Debug Output:
------------
When processing keyword arguments:
- sig_args = ['x'] (type: list)
- Attempting to execute: values[sig_args] = value
- This fails because lists are unhashable and cannot be dictionary keys

The bug is a clear typo where the code uses 'sig_args' (the full list of signature arguments) instead of 'name' (the current argument being processed) as the dictionary key.

Effect:
-------
This bug completely breaks the ability to use keyword arguments when calling template-defined functions ({{def}} directive). Any attempt to use keyword syntax (e.g., func(x=1, y=2)) will crash with a TypeError. Only positional arguments would work, severely limiting the functionality of template functions.
