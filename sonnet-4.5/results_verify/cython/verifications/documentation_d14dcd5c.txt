## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Found

1. **Dataframe Interchange Protocol Specification**:
   - The `get_chunks` method is part of the official Python dataframe interchange protocol
   - Specification states: "Return an iterator yielding the chunks"
   - For DataFrame.get_chunks: "By default (None), yields the chunks that the data is stored as by the producer. If given, n_chunks must be a multiple of self.num_chunks(), meaning the producer must subdivide each chunk before yielding it."
   - Note: The specification says n_chunks "must be a multiple" but pandas implementation doesn't enforce this

2. **Method Docstrings**:
   - PandasDataFrameXchg.get_chunks: "Return an iterator yielding the chunks."
   - PandasColumn.get_chunks: "Return an iterator yielding the chunks. See DataFrame.get_chunks for details on n_chunks."
   - Both docstrings are minimal and don't specify expected behavior for edge cases

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The protocol specification doesn't explicitly state that chunks cannot be empty
   - However, the purpose of chunking is to divide data for processing, and empty chunks serve no practical purpose
   - PyArrow's implementation includes a check for empty batches, suggesting empty chunks are not expected

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify

1. **Empty Chunks**: The documentation does not explicitly forbid empty chunks, but:
   - The purpose of chunking is to divide data for parallel processing
   - Empty chunks provide no value and waste computational resources
   - The mathematical expectation when dividing N items into K chunks is that each chunk contains at least ⌊N/K⌋ items

2. **Chunk Size Distribution**: The documentation doesn't specify how uneven divisions should be handled, but:
   - Common practice is to distribute items as evenly as possible
   - Having all "extra" items in early chunks and empty later chunks is counter to the goal of balanced distribution

3. **Edge Cases**: The documentation doesn't address:
   - What happens when n_chunks > size (current implementation can produce many empty chunks)
   - Whether all chunks should contain data
   - How to handle remainder items when size is not evenly divisible by n_chunks

### Conclusion
While the documentation doesn't explicitly forbid empty chunks, the current behavior violates the implicit contract and purpose of the chunking functionality. The fact that empty chunks can be produced is a logical flaw that makes the function less useful and potentially error-prone for consumers of the API.
