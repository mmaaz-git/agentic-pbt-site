REPRODUCTION RESULTS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug exists in the read_setup_file function, which is actually imported from distutils.extension (specifically from setuptools._distutils.extension.py).

Key Findings:
-------------
1. The bug is located at line 224 of /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/setuptools/_distutils/extension.py
2. The problematic code is: value[equals + 2 :] which should be value[equals + 1 :]
3. This causes the first character of any macro value to be dropped when parsing -DMACRO=value syntax

Test Results:
-------------
1. Basic Reproduction Test:
   - Input: -DVERSION=1.2.3
   - Expected: VERSION=1.2.3
   - Actual: VERSION=.2.3
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED

2. Single Character Value Test:
   - Input: -DDEBUG=0
   - Expected: DEBUG=0
   - Actual: DEBUG='' (empty string)
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED - Single character values are completely lost

3. Property-Based Test:
   - Multiple test cases all failed with the first character being dropped
   - Examples:
     * -DMACRO=0 → '' (expected '0')
     * -DMACRO=abc → 'bc' (expected 'abc')
     * -DMACRO=TEST → 'EST' (expected 'TEST')

4. Hypothesis Test:
   - The hypothesis test from the bug report fails immediately
   - Confirms that the bug affects all macro values with the = syntax

Impact:
-------
This is a genuine parsing bug that affects any setup file using -D flags with values. The bug consistently drops the first character of the macro value due to an off-by-one error in string slicing. This would break any build configuration that relies on macro definitions with values in setup files.

The bug is real and consistently reproducible.
