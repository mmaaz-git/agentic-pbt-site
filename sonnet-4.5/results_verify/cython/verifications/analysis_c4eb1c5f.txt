## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is reproducible and real - __name does leak into the template namespace
- The code shows inconsistent handling between __name (using get) and delimeters (using pop)
- The documentation indicates __name is for template naming, not as a template variable
- Python convention uses __ prefix for special/internal attributes that shouldn't be directly accessed

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- None - the bug is clearly valid and reproducible

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- It's a low-severity issue that may not affect many users
- Users can work around it by not using {{__name}} in their templates
- The parameter name starts with __, which typically indicates internal use

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The fix is trivial (changing get to pop)
- It creates unexpected behavior that violates principle of least surprise
- The inconsistency with delimeters handling suggests this is unintentional
- Could cause subtle bugs if someone has a template variable named __name

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to say "__name is also available as a template variable"

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current behavior contradicts the documented purpose of __name
- Making __name available as a template variable serves no useful purpose
- The inconsistent handling with delimeters suggests this is a code bug, not a documentation issue
- Documenting this behavior would cement a design flaw

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be reframed as "Please prevent __name from leaking into template namespace"

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is clearly a bug - the code inconsistently handles special parameters
- The current behavior is unintended based on code structure
- It's not requesting new functionality but fixing incorrect behavior

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- Clear inconsistency in code: delimeters uses pop(), __name uses get()
- __name leaks into template namespace contrary to its documented purpose
- Violates principle of least surprise and Python conventions for __ prefixed names
- The fix is straightforward and aligns the code with apparent intent
- The bug report includes valid reproduction code and property-based test
- No documentation suggests __name should be accessible as a template variable

**Arguments against BUG:**
- None significant - this is clearly a bug

### Conclusion
This is a valid BUG. The code shows clear inconsistency in handling special parameters, with delimeters being properly removed from kwargs while __name is not. This causes __name to leak into the template namespace, which contradicts its documented purpose as a meta-parameter for template naming. The fix is trivial and would align the code with its apparent intent.
