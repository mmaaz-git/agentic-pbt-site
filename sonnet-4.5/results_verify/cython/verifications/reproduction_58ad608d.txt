REPRODUCTION REPORT FOR pyximport.handle_special_build BUG

## Bug Reproduction Status
SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED - The bug is real and occurs exactly as described in the report.

## Test Results

### Direct Reproduction Test
When creating a .pyxbld file with only make_setup_args() function (no make_ext):
- Result: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'sources'
- Location: pyximport.py line 132
- This matches exactly what the bug report claims

### Control Tests
1. With both make_ext and make_setup_args:
   - Result: SUCCESS - Both ext and setup_args are returned properly

2. With only make_ext (no make_setup_args):
   - Result: SUCCESS - ext is returned, setup_args is empty dict

3. With only make_setup_args (no make_ext):
   - Result: FAILURE - AttributeError on accessing ext.sources

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test from the bug report was run successfully:
- When include_make_ext=True: Test passes
- When include_make_ext=False: Test fails with AttributeError
- The failure occurs consistently on line 132 when trying to access ext.sources

## Technical Analysis
The crash occurs because:
1. When only make_setup_args is defined, make_ext is None, so ext remains None (line 112)
2. The code correctly validates this scenario with "assert ext or setup_args" (line 129)
3. However, immediately after, the code unconditionally accesses ext.sources (line 131-132)
4. Since ext is None, this causes AttributeError

## Verification of the Fix
The proposed fix in the bug report is:
```python
if ext:
    ext.sources = [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(special_build), source)
                   for source in ext.sources]
```

This fix is correct because:
- It only processes ext.sources when ext is not None
- It preserves the existing behavior when ext exists
- It allows the function to return (None, setup_args) when only make_setup_args is defined

The bug report's analysis and proposed fix are technically accurate.
