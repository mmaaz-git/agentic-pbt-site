Bug Triage Analysis
===================

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The code explicitly contains logic to handle non-string paths (lines 99-102)
2. The logic is fundamentally broken in Python 3 - it tries to encode() bytes and Path objects
3. The comment indicates intent to handle different types ("distutils is stupid in Py2...")
4. The function crashes with common Python 3 path types (bytes, pathlib.Path)
5. The fix is straightforward and makes the code work as originally intended

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function has no documentation stating it should accept non-string types
2. The comment mentions this is for Python 2 compatibility, not for general type handling

### INVALID (Not a Real Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function has no documentation promising support for bytes or Path objects
2. Most Python functions expect string paths unless explicitly documented otherwise
3. The user could easily convert their paths to strings before calling the function

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code explicitly tries to handle non-string types with the isinstance check
2. The function crashes rather than providing a helpful error message
3. Modern Python conventions support Path objects widely

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Users can easily work around this by converting to strings
2. This is legacy code with Python 2 compatibility cruft
3. pyximport is mostly used internally and rarely needs Path/bytes support

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code already has logic attempting to handle this case - it's just broken
2. The fix is simple and improves Python 3 compatibility
3. Path objects are increasingly common in modern Python code

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Supporting Path objects could be seen as a new feature for Python 3
2. No documentation promises this functionality
3. The original code was for Python 2 unicode handling, not Path support

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code already has an isinstance check attempting to handle non-strings
2. This isn't adding new functionality - it's fixing broken existing code
3. The function crashes instead of gracefully rejecting unsupported types

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function could document that it only accepts strings
2. The lack of type documentation led to this confusion

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code actually crashes - this isn't just a documentation mismatch
2. The code has explicit logic trying to handle non-strings
3. Documenting "strings only" would contradict the existing code logic

## Analysis Summary

The key factors are:
1. **Existing code intent**: The function has explicit code (lines 99-102) attempting to handle non-string types
2. **Python 2→3 migration issue**: The code is broken due to incomplete Python 2 to 3 migration
3. **Crash vs error**: The function crashes ungracefully rather than providing helpful errors
4. **Modern Python conventions**: Path objects are standard in Python 3
5. **Simple fix available**: The bug report provides a working fix

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** because:
1. The code explicitly attempts to handle non-string types with dedicated logic
2. That logic is fundamentally broken in Python 3 (the only supported Python version now)
3. The function crashes with AttributeError/TypeError instead of handling inputs gracefully
4. The issue is caused by incomplete Python 2→3 migration, not missing functionality
5. The fix aligns the implementation with the apparent original intent of the code
