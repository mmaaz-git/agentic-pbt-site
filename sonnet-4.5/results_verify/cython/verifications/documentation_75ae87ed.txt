## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `is_valid_tag` function has a docstring that states:
```
Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments
to functions creating generator expressions,
however they are not identifiers.

See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5552
```

### Key Findings

1. **Purpose from Documentation**:
   - The function was created specifically to handle issue #5552
   - Issue #5552 relates to debug mode compilation failures with generator expressions
   - The specific problem was that Cython internally generates argument names like '.0', '.1' for generator expressions
   - These names would cause lxml to crash with "invalid tag name" errors during debug info generation

2. **XML Specification Requirements**:
   According to W3C XML specification:
   - XML tag names CANNOT start with digits (0-9)
   - XML tag names CANNOT start with period (.) or hyphen (-)
   - XML tag names CANNOT contain control characters (characters below #x20)
   - First character must be: letter, underscore, colon, or specific Unicode ranges
   - Subsequent characters can include digits, periods, hyphens

3. **Function Implementation vs Intent**:
   - The function only checks for one specific pattern: EncodedString starting with "." followed by decimals
   - It returns `True` for all other inputs, implicitly assuming they are valid
   - There is NO documentation stating the function should validate general XML tag names
   - The docstring only mentions the specific case of '.0' style names

4. **Usage Context**:
   - The function is used as a guard before calling XML library functions
   - It silently skips invalid tags rather than raising errors
   - The design appears to be: skip known-invalid tags (like '.0') and pass everything else through

### Documentation Gap
The function name `is_valid_tag` strongly implies it validates XML tag names in general, but:
- The documentation only mentions one specific invalid pattern
- There's no specification that it should validate against full XML requirements
- The original issue #5552 was only about '.0' style names, not general XML validation

### Conclusion
There is a mismatch between:
1. What the function name suggests (general XML tag validation)
2. What the documentation says (filtering '.0' style names)
3. What the function actually does (only checks for '.0' pattern)
4. What would be needed to prevent crashes (full XML tag validation)
