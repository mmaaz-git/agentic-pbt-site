## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Status
1. **Cython Documentation:** The official Cython documentation does not mention the Plex module's internal implementation details or the specific error handling behavior of the RE class.

2. **Plex Module Purpose:** Based on external documentation and the source code itself:
   - Plex is a lexical analysis module integrated into Cython
   - Used for constructing scanners/lexers for parsing
   - Provides regular expression-based token matching

### Code Documentation
From examining the source code:

1. **Errors.py defines PlexTypeError:**
   - PlexTypeError is a properly defined exception class (line 12-13)
   - Inherits from both PlexError and TypeError
   - Clearly intended to be raised for type-related errors

2. **Regexps.py wrong_type method:**
   - No docstring or comments explaining the method's purpose
   - Implementation shows clear intent: construct a helpful error message when wrong type is passed
   - Should raise PlexTypeError with a message like: "Invalid type for argument X of Plex.ClassName (expected Y, got Z)"

### Expected Behavior
Based on the code structure and exception hierarchy:
1. When an invalid type is passed to an RE constructor, the wrong_type method should be called
2. The method should determine what type was actually passed
3. It should raise a PlexTypeError with a descriptive message
4. This is consistent with Python's standard practice of raising TypeError for type mismatches

### Documentation Verdict
While there's no explicit documentation stating "wrong_type must raise PlexTypeError", the code's intent is unambiguous:
- The method name is "wrong_type"
- It constructs an error message about type mismatch
- It raises PlexTypeError at the end
- The bug prevents this intended behavior from working in Python 3

The lack of formal documentation doesn't invalidate this bug - the code's purpose is clear from its implementation.
