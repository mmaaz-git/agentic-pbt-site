## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation:
The `normalise_float_repr` function has only minimal inline documentation - a docstring that states:
```
Generate a 'normalised', simple digits string representation of a float value
to allow string comparisons. Examples: '.123', '123.456', '123.'
```

### Key Findings:

1. **No External Documentation**: There is no external documentation for this function in the official Cython documentation. It appears to be an internal utility function.

2. **Purpose from Context**: Based on code analysis:
   - The function is used internally in the Cython compiler (ExprNodes.py) for handling float constants
   - It's used to normalize float representations for comparison purposes
   - The test suite shows it's expected to convert scientific notation to decimal notation

3. **Expected Behavior from Tests**: The test suite (TestCythonUtils.py) shows various test cases, all of which are POSITIVE numbers or zero. Notable absence: NO NEGATIVE NUMBER TEST CASES exist in the test suite.

4. **Implicit Contract from Tests**:
   - The function should produce a string that can be converted back to float: `self.assertEqual(float(float_str), float(result))`
   - The output should be mathematically equivalent to the input
   - Examples from tests show it handles:
     - Simple decimals: '.1' → '.1'
     - Trailing zeros removal: '1.0' → '1.'
     - Scientific notation: '1E5' → '100000.'
     - Negative exponents: '.1E-5' → '.000001'

5. **Missing Documentation Elements**:
   - No specification for negative number handling
   - No mention of edge cases or limitations
   - No formal specification of the output format

### Critical Observation:
The test suite contains ZERO negative number test cases. This is a significant oversight that allowed this bug to go undetected. The function's behavior with negative numbers is completely unspecified and untested.

### Conclusion:
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that the function must handle negative numbers, the fact that it accepts string representations of floats (which can be negative) and must produce valid float strings strongly implies it should handle negative numbers correctly. The function's failure to produce valid float strings for negative inputs with negative exponents is clearly a bug, not undocumented behavior.
