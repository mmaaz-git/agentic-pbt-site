# Documentation Analysis for restore_Options Function

## Documentation Status
The `restore_Options` and `backup_Options` functions in `Cython.Compiler.Tests.Utils` have minimal documentation:

1. **No formal documentation**: These functions are not documented in the official Cython documentation (checked docs.cython.org)
2. **No docstrings**: The functions lack docstrings explaining their purpose or behavior
3. **Only inline comment**: A single comment exists: "# strip Options from new keys that might have been added:"

## Inferred Purpose from Code and Usage

Based on analysis of the source code and test files using these functions:

1. **backup_Options()**: Creates a snapshot of all current Options module attributes, with special deep-copy handling for `_directive_defaults`

2. **restore_Options(backup)**: Intended to:
   - Restore all Options attributes to their values from the backup
   - Remove any new attributes added to Options after the backup was created
   - Ensure Options module returns to its exact state at backup time

## Usage Context

These functions are used in Cython's test suite:
- `TestCmdLine.py`: Uses them in setUp/tearDown to isolate test cases
- `TestCythonizeArgsParser.py`: Similarly uses them for test isolation

The functions serve as test utilities to ensure that modifications to global Options state in one test don't affect other tests.

## Expected Behavior

While not explicitly documented, the clear intention from the code structure and usage is:
1. The function should restore Options to its exact backup state
2. This includes removing attributes added after backup
3. The restoration should complete without errors

## Documentation Assessment

The lack of formal documentation doesn't make this bug report invalid because:
1. The function has a clear, observable intended behavior from its implementation
2. The inline comment explicitly states it should "strip Options from new keys"
3. The usage pattern in test files confirms this expected behavior
4. The RuntimeError prevents the function from achieving its obvious purpose

The bug violates the fundamental expectation that a restore function should successfully complete its restoration operation without crashing.
