## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
1. **Violates Logical Expectations**: When dividing N items into K chunks, users reasonably expect all chunks to contain at least some data. Empty chunks serve no practical purpose.

2. **Causes Real Problems**:
   - Empty chunks waste computational resources in parallel processing
   - Can cause errors in downstream code that assumes non-empty data
   - Makes load balancing ineffective

3. **Mathematical Incorrectness**: The current algorithm extends the iteration range beyond the actual data size (iterating to `step * n_chunks` instead of `size`), which is clearly a logical error.

4. **Inconsistent with Purpose**: The interchange protocol's purpose is data exchange and processing. Empty chunks don't contribute to this goal.

5. **Simple Fix Available**: The proposed fix is trivial and correct - changing `range(0, step * n_chunks, step)` to `range(0, size, step)`.

**Arguments Against:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly forbid empty chunks (weak argument)

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
1. Documentation doesn't explicitly state chunks cannot be empty
2. The function technically returns chunks as promised

**Arguments Against:**
1. Just because behavior isn't explicitly forbidden doesn't mean it's correct
2. The function's purpose and common sense dictate that chunks should contain data
3. The bug is in the implementation logic, not in misunderstanding the specification

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
1. Could be considered an edge case (but it's not that obscure)
2. Workaround exists (users can filter out empty chunks)

**Arguments Against:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - it happens whenever size % n_chunks != 0, which is common
2. The fix is trivial and improves the function's usefulness
3. Empty chunks can cause real issues in production code

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
1. Could argue that "no empty chunks" is a new feature not originally specified

**Arguments Against:**
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. The current behavior is clearly a bug in the implementation logic
3. Users reasonably expect chunks to contain data

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
1. Documentation could be clearer about chunk behavior

**Arguments Against:**
1. The code is wrong, not the documentation
2. The fix should be in the implementation, not just documenting the broken behavior
3. No reasonable documentation would specify that empty chunks are expected

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation contains a logical error where it iterates beyond the DataFrame's size, producing empty chunks. This violates:
1. The reasonable expectation that chunks contain data
2. The mathematical principle of dividing N items into K non-empty groups
3. The practical purpose of the chunking functionality

The bug is reproducible, impacts real use cases, and has a simple, correct fix. The fact that documentation doesn't explicitly forbid empty chunks is irrelevant - the current behavior is clearly incorrect and unintended.
