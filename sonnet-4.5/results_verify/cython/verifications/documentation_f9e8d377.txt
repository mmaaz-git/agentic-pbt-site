DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function: Cython.Distutils.extension.read_setup_file
(Actually distutils.extension.read_setup_file, imported by Cython)

Official Documentation:
-----------------------
The function has minimal official documentation:
- Docstring: "Reads a Setup file and returns Extension instances."
- No detailed specification of the expected format or parsing behavior

Setup File Format Background:
-----------------------------
The Setup file format is a legacy format from Python's makesetup build system, used before modern setuptools. The format supports:
1. Module definitions with source files
2. Preprocessor arguments (-I, -D, -U, -C)
3. Library specifications (-l, -L)

Expected -D Flag Behavior:
--------------------------
Based on C compiler conventions and distutils documentation:
1. -DMACRO should define MACRO without a value (like #define MACRO)
2. -DMACRO=value should define MACRO with the specified value (like #define MACRO value)

This is consistent with standard C compiler behavior where:
- gcc -DDEBUG=1 defines DEBUG as 1
- gcc -DVERSION=1.2.3 defines VERSION as 1.2.3

Documentation Evidence:
-----------------------
From distutils Extension class documentation:
- define_macros is a list of 2-tuples: (name, value)
- value can be a string or None
- This maps to -DMACRO=value or -DMACRO compiler flags

The read_setup_file function is supposed to parse Setup files and convert -D flags into these tuples for the Extension object.

Expected Behavior:
------------------
When parsing "-DVERSION=1.2.3", the function should:
1. Detect the -D prefix
2. Find the = sign at position 7 (after "VERSION")
3. Extract "VERSION" as the macro name
4. Extract "1.2.3" as the macro value
5. Create the tuple ("VERSION", "1.2.3")

Documentation Gaps:
-------------------
1. The function's docstring doesn't specify the exact parsing rules
2. No examples are provided in the documentation
3. The Setup file format itself is poorly documented
4. The handling of edge cases is not specified

However, given that:
1. This function imports compiler flags that follow standard C conventions
2. The -D flag behavior is well-established in C compilers
3. The distutils Extension class expects full values in define_macros tuples

The expected behavior is clear: -DMACRO=value should preserve the entire value, not drop the first character.

Conclusion:
-----------
While the documentation is sparse, the intended behavior can be inferred from:
1. Standard C compiler conventions
2. The distutils Extension class expectations
3. Common sense parsing of command-line flags

The bug (dropping the first character of macro values) clearly violates the expected behavior based on these standards, even if not explicitly documented.
