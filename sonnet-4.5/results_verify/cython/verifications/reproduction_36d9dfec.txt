## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug manifests exactly as described:

1. **Direct reproduction test**: When calling `max()` on an empty dictionary, Python raises a `ValueError` with the message "max() iterable argument is empty", which matches the expected behavior described in the bug report.

2. **Property-based test**: The Hypothesis test successfully runs and confirms that the logic fails with an empty dictionary but works with non-empty dictionaries.

3. **Actual code inspection**: I examined the actual Cython source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libcython.py` and confirmed:
   - Line 1262 in `CyLocals.invoke` contains the problematic code: `max_name_length = len(max(local_cython_vars, key=len))`
   - This line has no guard to check if `local_cython_vars` is empty before calling `max()`
   - When `local_cython_vars` is an empty dictionary, `max()` raises a ValueError

### Verification of the Inconsistency

The bug report correctly identifies an inconsistency between `CyLocals.invoke` and `CyGlobals.invoke`:
- `CyGlobals.invoke` (lines 1288-1291) properly guards the `max()` call with `if module_globals:` and `if global_python_dict:`
- `CyLocals.invoke` (line 1262) does not have any such guard

### Real-World Scenario

The bug report's claim about a "real scenario" is valid. A Cython function with no local variables is indeed possible and legitimate:
- A function that only contains a `pass` statement
- A function that only uses global variables
- A function that only manipulates its parameters without creating local variables

In such cases, the debugger's `cy locals` command would crash instead of gracefully handling the empty locals situation.

### Conclusion

The bug is real, reproducible, and occurs exactly as described in the report. The code crashes with a ValueError when encountering a Cython function with no local variables, which is a legitimate scenario that should be handled gracefully.
