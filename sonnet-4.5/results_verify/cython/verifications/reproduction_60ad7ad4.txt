## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Reproduction Results

1. **The bug is reproducible**: Running the exact code from the bug report produces the claimed RuntimeError:
   - Code: Adding a new attribute to Options after creating a backup, then calling restore_Options
   - Result: `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`
   - This confirms the technical accuracy of the bug report

2. **Root cause confirmed**: The error occurs at lines 22-24 of Utils.py:
   ```python
   for name in vars(Options).keys():
       if name not in backup:
           delattr(Options, name)
   ```
   This code iterates over dictionary keys while simultaneously deleting from the same dictionary, which is a well-known Python error pattern.

3. **The proposed fix works**: Changing `vars(Options).keys()` to `list(vars(Options).keys())` resolves the issue:
   - Creates a snapshot of the keys before iteration begins
   - Allows safe deletion during iteration
   - The function completes successfully and correctly removes the new attribute

4. **Expected behavior achieved**: After applying the fix:
   - The function no longer raises RuntimeError
   - New attributes added to Options are correctly removed
   - Original attributes are properly restored
   - The function fulfills its documented purpose (per the comment "strip Options from new keys that might have been added")

5. **Impact assessment**: This is a real bug that affects test utilities:
   - The function is part of test utilities meant to isolate test state
   - Without the fix, tests cannot properly clean up after adding new Options attributes
   - This could lead to test pollution and false test results

The bug report's technical details are accurate and the proposed fix is correct.
