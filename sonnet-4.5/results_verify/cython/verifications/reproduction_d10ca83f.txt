## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Environment
- Python version: 3.13.2
- Cython installed at: /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython

### Bug Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report. The bug manifests when trying to create a Seq with an invalid (non-RE) second argument.

### Test Results

1. **Direct Reproduction Test:**
   - Code: `Seq(Str('a'), "not an RE")`
   - Expected: PlexTypeError with a meaningful error message
   - Actual: AttributeError: module 'types' has no attribute 'InstanceType'
   - The bug occurs exactly as reported

2. **Root Cause Verification:**
   - Checked line 167 in /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Plex/Regexps.py
   - Confirmed the problematic code: `if type(value) == types.InstanceType:`
   - Verified that `types.InstanceType` does not exist in Python 3
   - This attribute was removed in Python 3.0 as it was specific to old-style classes in Python 2

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The bug occurs in the `wrong_type` method of the RE class
   - This method is called whenever type validation fails for RE constructor arguments
   - Instead of raising the intended PlexTypeError with a helpful message, users get a cryptic AttributeError
   - This affects all RE constructors that perform type validation (Seq, Alt, Rep1, etc.)

### Conclusion
The bug is real and significant. It completely breaks the error handling mechanism for invalid RE arguments in Python 3, replacing helpful error messages with confusing AttributeErrors about a missing types.InstanceType attribute.
