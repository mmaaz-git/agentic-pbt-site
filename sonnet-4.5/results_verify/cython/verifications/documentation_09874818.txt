DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR strip_common_indent

1. Function Location and Purpose:
The strip_common_indent function is located in Cython/Build/Inline.py and is used internally by the cython_inline function to process code strings before compilation.

2. Documentation Status:
- The function has NO docstring or inline documentation
- There are no comments explaining its intended behavior beyond brief inline comments like "# blank" and "# comment"
- No external documentation was found in Cython's documentation

3. Observed Usage Context:
The function is called in two contexts within the same file:
- Line 179: In cython_inline() to process user code
- Lines 326-327: In _get_build_extension() to process setup_code and code

4. Inferred Purpose from Implementation:
Based on the code structure, the function appears to:
- Find the minimum indentation level among non-blank, non-comment lines
- Strip that common indentation from all code lines
- The first loop explicitly skips comment lines (lines starting with '#') when calculating min_indent
- The intent appears to be normalizing indented code blocks while preserving relative indentation

5. Comment Handling Intent:
The code explicitly checks for comment lines in TWO places:
- First loop (line 416): Skips comments when calculating minimum indent
- Second loop (line 422): Attempts to skip comments when stripping indentation

This suggests comments should be treated specially and NOT have their indentation stripped in the same way as code lines. However, the exact intended behavior for comments is not documented.

6. Key Observation:
Without explicit documentation, the intended behavior for comment preservation is ambiguous. The code suggests comments should be handled differently from regular code lines, but it's unclear whether:
- Comments should preserve their original indentation
- Comments should be left untouched entirely
- Comments should follow some other rule

The lack of documentation makes it impossible to definitively say what the "correct" behavior should be.
