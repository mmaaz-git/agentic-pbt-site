REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

== Bug Verification ==

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The function `workaround_for_coding_style_checker` in the TestList class has the following issues:

1. **Missing Return Statement**: CONFIRMED
   - The function computes a `correct_result` variable through string manipulation
   - It processes each line from `correct_result_test_list_inside_func`
   - It adds spacing to lines shorter than 10 characters
   - It removes the trailing newline
   - However, it NEVER returns the computed result
   - Any call to this function returns None (Python's default for functions without explicit return)

2. **Unused Parameter**: CONFIRMED
   - The function accepts a parameter `correct_result_wrong_whitespace`
   - This parameter is never referenced or used anywhere in the function body
   - The function would behave identically regardless of what value is passed

== Reproduction Results ==

Source code examination (lines 384-391 of test_libcython_in_gdb.py):
- Line 384: Function definition with unused parameter
- Lines 385-390: Computation of correct_result variable
- Line 391: Empty line (no return statement)

Running the reproduction test confirms:
- Function always returns None regardless of input
- The parameter has no effect on the function's (non-existent) output
- The computed `correct_result` string is lost when the function exits

== Impact ==

The function is completely non-functional in its current state:
- It performs computation but provides no output
- It cannot be used for its apparent intended purpose (fixing whitespace in test results)
- The function name "workaround_for_coding_style_checker" suggests it should return a corrected string
- Without a return statement, the function has no observable effect besides consuming CPU cycles
