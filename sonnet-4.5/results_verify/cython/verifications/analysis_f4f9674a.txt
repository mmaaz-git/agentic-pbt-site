BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
===================================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
-----------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The crash is reproducible and consistent
- The code clearly shows a typo: using 'sig_args' (a list) instead of 'name' (a string) as dictionary key
- The implementation clearly intends to support keyword arguments (evident from code structure)
- The parse_signature function successfully parses keyword arguments
- The crash prevents a core feature from working entirely
- The fix is straightforward and obvious: change values[sig_args] to values[name]
- This is not an edge case - it affects ALL keyword argument usage in template functions

Arguments AGAINST:
- None found

INVALID (Incorrect Report)
---------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- None - the bug is real and reproducible

Arguments AGAINST:
- The bug exists exactly as described
- The root cause analysis is correct
- The proposed fix would resolve the issue

WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
--------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- None - this is a significant functionality break

Arguments AGAINST:
- This completely breaks keyword argument support in template functions
- Not an obscure edge case - affects normal usage
- The feature is clearly intended to work based on the code

FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Documentation doesn't explicitly show keyword argument examples

Arguments AGAINST:
- The code explicitly implements keyword argument handling
- The parse_signature function parses keyword arguments
- The _parse_signature method has branches specifically for keyword arguments
- This is clearly a bug (typo) not a missing feature

DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error)
----------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Documentation could be clearer about {{def}} functionality

Arguments AGAINST:
- The issue is in the code, not the documentation
- The code attempts to implement the feature but has a bug
- Even without documentation, the code structure shows clear intent

CONCLUSION
----------
This is unequivocally a BUG. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. Clear typo in the code: values[sig_args] should be values[name]
2. The feature is implemented but broken by this single character typo
3. The crash is consistent and affects all keyword argument usage
4. The code structure shows clear intent to support this functionality
5. The fix is trivial and obvious

This is a textbook example of a valid bug report - a simple typo causing a complete feature failure.
