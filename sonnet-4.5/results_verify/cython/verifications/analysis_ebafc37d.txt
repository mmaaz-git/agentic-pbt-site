Bug Report Triage Analysis
==========================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The docstring examples for parse_list don't include empty quoted strings, so one could argue this behavior was never intended to be supported. The function might have been designed only for non-empty values in distutils directives, as empty library names or source files don't make practical sense.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
Empty strings are valid Python string literals, and the function clearly aims to parse Python-like list syntax. The docstring shows support for various quoted string formats including spaces and commas, so empty strings should logically be supported. The function crashes with an unhandled KeyError rather than a deliberate validation error, indicating this is unintended behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Empty strings in distutils directives serve no practical purpose - you wouldn't have an empty library name or empty source file. The edge case of parsing [""] might be considered too obscure to fix, especially if no real-world use case exists for empty strings in these configuration values.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The function is a general-purpose list parser used beyond just distutils directives. Crashing with KeyError is poor user experience even for edge cases. The fix is straightforward and would make the parser more robust. Other parsers in Python handle empty strings without crashing.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to explicitly state that empty strings are not supported, making the current behavior expected. The docstring could add a note that all quoted values must be non-empty.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The issue is clearly a crash due to implementation oversight, not a documentation problem. The code attempts to parse the empty string but fails due to the bug, rather than intentionally rejecting it. Documenting a KeyError as expected behavior would be inappropriate.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting empty strings could be viewed as a new feature since the examples don't show this case. The current implementation might have intentionally excluded empty strings, and adding support would be an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already attempts to parse empty strings but crashes due to a bug. This isn't adding new functionality but fixing existing broken behavior. The parser accepts the input and processes it, just failing at the final lookup step.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with an unhandled KeyError when given valid Python string literal syntax. Empty strings are legitimate string literals in Python. The crash occurs due to clear implementation bugs: strip_string_literals doesn't handle empty strings, and there's a label format mismatch. The function should either parse empty strings correctly or reject them gracefully, not crash.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The docstring doesn't explicitly show empty string support, so this might be considered unsupported input. The practical use case for empty strings in distutils configuration is questionable.

## Overall Consideration

This is clearly a BUG. The parse_list function is designed to parse Python-like list syntax for configuration values, and empty strings are valid Python string literals. The function doesn't deliberately reject empty strings - it attempts to process them but crashes due to implementation oversights. The KeyError exceptions are unhandled errors, not intentional validation failures.

The root causes are well-identified: strip_string_literals fails to capture empty string literals in its mapping, and there's a format mismatch between how labels are created and accessed. These are straightforward implementation bugs, not design choices or documentation issues. The function should handle all valid quoted strings consistently, including empty ones.

While empty strings might not be common in distutils directives, the parser should be robust enough to handle valid syntax without crashing. The proposed fix is minimal and addresses the core issues. This warrants classification as a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
