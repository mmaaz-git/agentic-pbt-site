## Reproduction Analysis

### Environment
- Pandas version: 2.3.2
- NumPy version: 2.3.0
- Python version: 3.13.2

### Test Results

I ran the exact test cases provided in the bug report, including both the hypothesis test and the specific reproduction example.

#### Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis test provided in the bug report **PASSES** without any failures across 500 examples testing days from -10000 to +10000.

#### Specific Reproduction Test
Testing the exact code from the bug report with inputs `[-1, -5, -10]` days:
- **Expected output** (according to bug report): Dates in year 2555
- **Actual output**: Correct dates: `['1969-12-31', '1969-12-27', '1969-12-22']`

#### Detailed Analysis of the Code Path

The code in `parse_datetime_format_str()` does the following for date32 ("tdD") format:
```python
data = (data.astype(np.uint64) * (24 * 60 * 60)).astype("datetime64[s]")
```

For input `-1` (int32):
1. `data.astype(np.uint64)` converts -1 to 18446744073709551615 (2^64 - 1)
2. Multiplying by 86400 results in 18446744073709465216 (with overflow)
3. Converting to `datetime64[s]` correctly produces '1969-12-31T00:00:00'
4. The underlying int64 value is correctly -86400 seconds

### Key Finding
Despite the intermediate uint64 overflow, NumPy's `datetime64` conversion correctly interprets the overflowed uint64 value and produces the correct negative timestamp. The conversion appears to work correctly due to how NumPy handles the binary representation during the type conversion.

### Testing Extended Range
Tested with values from -1 to -36500 days (100 years before epoch):
- All conversions produced correct dates
- All underlying int64 values matched expected seconds since epoch

### Conclusion on Technical Accuracy
The bug report's claim that the code produces incorrect dates (year 2555 instead of 1969) **could not be reproduced** in the test environment. The code appears to work correctly despite the conceptually problematic uint64 conversion.

### Possible Explanations
1. **NumPy version difference**: The bug might only occur in specific NumPy versions
2. **Platform-specific behavior**: The overflow handling might differ on different platforms
3. **Incorrect bug report**: The reporter may have misidentified the issue or tested incorrectly

The technical implementation is admittedly confusing (converting signed to unsigned), but it appears to work correctly in practice due to NumPy's handling of the conversion.
