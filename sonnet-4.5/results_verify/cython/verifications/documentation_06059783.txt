## Documentation Analysis for old_build_ext Option Precedence

After examining the source code and available documentation:

### Source Code Documentation
The old_build_ext.py module has a docstring stating:
- "Note that this module is deprecated. Use cythonize() instead."
- The module implements a version of Distutils 'build_ext' command for building Cython extension modules

### Option Precedence in Comments
In the source code (lines 205-221 and 256-262), there are comments explicitly describing the precedence:

For compiler options (lines 205-221):
- "Setup create_list and cplus from the extension options if Cython.Distutils.extension.Extension is used, otherwise just use what was parsed from the command-line or the configuration file."

For include paths (lines 236-240):
- "Set up the include_path for the Cython compiler:
  1. Start with the command line option.
  2. Add in any (unique) paths from the extension cython_include_dirs"

For compiler directives (lines 256-262):
- "Set up Cython compiler directives:
  1. Start with the command line option.
  2. Add in any (unique) entries from the extension cython_directives"

### General Cython Documentation
The official Cython documentation confirms that command-line options should have the highest precedence:
- "Directives passed on the command line will override directives set in header comments."
- The hierarchy is: command-line options > per-file directives > cythonize() directives > defaults

### Expected Behavior
Based on both the inline comments and Cython's general documentation, command-line options should take precedence over extension attributes. The pattern should be:
1. Use command-line value if set
2. Otherwise, fall back to extension attribute
3. Otherwise, use default

The documentation clearly indicates that command-line options are meant to override extension-level settings, not be overridden by them.
