BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

Test Execution Summary:
-----------------------

1. Basic Bug Reproduction Test:
   - Created a .pyxbld file with ONLY make_setup_args() function
   - Result: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'sources'
   - This confirms the bug report's claim

2. Hypothesis Test Results:
   All four possible combinations were tested:

   a) No pyxbld file: SUCCESS (ext=None, setup_args={})
   b) Only make_ext: SUCCESS (ext=Extension object, setup_args={})
   c) Both make_ext and make_setup_args: SUCCESS (both set correctly)
   d) Only make_setup_args: FAILURE with AttributeError

3. Detailed Combination Tests:
   Confirmed the same pattern - the function crashes ONLY when:
   - A .pyxbld file exists
   - The file defines make_setup_args()
   - The file does NOT define make_ext()

Technical Analysis of the Crash:
--------------------------------

The crash occurs at line 131-132 in handle_special_build():
    ext.sources = [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(special_build), source)
                   for source in ext.sources]

At this point:
- ext is None (because make_ext was not defined)
- The code tries to access ext.sources
- Python raises AttributeError on NoneType

The Bug Report's Claims:
------------------------
1. CORRECT: The function crashes with AttributeError when only make_setup_args is defined
2. CORRECT: The crash happens because ext is None when make_ext is not defined
3. CORRECT: Line 129's assertion allows ext to be None (assert ext or setup_args)
4. CORRECT: Line 131 unconditionally accesses ext.sources causing the crash
5. CORRECT: The proposed fix (adding if ext: before line 131) would prevent the crash

Code Logic Analysis:
-------------------
The assertion at line 129 explicitly allows for the case where ext is None:
    assert ext or setup_args, ("neither make_ext nor make_setup_args %s" % special_build)

This assertion passes when:
- ext is truthy (make_ext was defined and returned an Extension)
- setup_args is truthy (make_setup_args was defined and returned a non-empty dict)
- Both are truthy

The assertion clearly indicates the developers intended to support having only make_setup_args without make_ext. However, the code immediately after (line 131) assumes ext is not None, creating an inconsistency in the implementation.

Reproduction Confirmed:
----------------------
The bug is 100% reproducible using the provided test case. The behavior matches exactly what the bug report describes.
