## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code has a clear typo: `'kwonly='` in repr vs actual attribute `kw_only`
- This violates Python's __repr__ convention that output should reflect actual attributes
- The inconsistency creates confusion when debugging (repr shows "kwonly" but you access via "kw_only")
- Cython claims compatibility with standard library dataclasses, which use `kw_only=` in repr
- The bug is easily reproducible and the fix is straightforward
- This is not just a cosmetic issue - it affects the contract between repr output and object attributes

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is a clear bug.

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug report is correct and well-documented.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code clearly has the typo (line 66 uses 'kwonly=' while attribute is 'kw_only')
- The test correctly demonstrates the issue
- The expected behavior matches Python standard library conventions

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue it's a minor cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality
- The attribute still works correctly when accessed as `kw_only`
- Users might not frequently use repr() on Field objects

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This violates Python conventions and standard library compatibility
- Makes debugging harder when repr doesn't match actual attributes
- The fix is trivial (changing 'kwonly=' to 'kw_only=' on one line)
- Not an obscure edge case - anyone using repr() on Field objects will see this

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The code is wrong, not the documentation.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation (implicitly via standard library compatibility) says kw_only should be used
- The actual attribute IS named kw_only correctly
- Only the repr output is wrong

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The repr method already exists and should work correctly
- This is a bug fix, not a new feature

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The repr output uses the wrong attribute name ('kwonly' instead of 'kw_only'), violating Python conventions where repr should accurately represent the object's attributes. This is not a documentation issue, feature request, or trivial enough for WONTFIX - it's a straightforward typo that breaks the contract between an object's repr and its actual attributes.
