## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Environment
- Python 3.13 with Cython installed
- Linux platform where sysconfig.get_config_var('EXE') normally returns '' (empty string)

### Reproduction Method
The bug report provides code that mocks sysconfig.get_config_var to return None for the 'EXE' variable, simulating platforms or configurations where this variable is not defined.

### Test Results

1. **Normal behavior on this Linux system:**
   - sysconfig.get_config_var('EXE') returns '' (empty string)
   - String concatenation works fine: "basename" + "" = "basename"

2. **When mocked to return None:**
   - EXE_EXT becomes None
   - String concatenation fails with TypeError: "can only concatenate str (not 'NoneType') to str"

3. **Impact on module functions:**
   - build() function fails at line 139: `exe_file = basename + EXE_EXT`
   - clink() function would fail at line 110: `basename + EXE_EXT`
   - Both produce the exact TypeError described in the bug report

### Verification of Bug Report Claims
The bug report is technically accurate:
- sysconfig.get_config_var('EXE') CAN return None (documented Python behavior)
- When it returns None, EXE_EXT becomes None
- String concatenation with None does raise TypeError
- The error occurs exactly where the bug report indicates (lines 110 and 139)

### Real-World Scenario
While the test uses mocking, this is a legitimate scenario that could occur:
- On platforms where the EXE configuration variable is not defined
- In minimal Python installations or embedded systems
- When Python's sysconfig is incomplete or misconfigured

The bug represents a real crash that would prevent the module from functioning on affected systems.
