DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR chars_to_ranges

Function Location: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Plex/Regexps.py

Function Docstring:
"""
Return a list of character codes consisting of pairs
[code1a, code1b, code2a, code2b,...] which cover all
the characters in |s|.
"""

Key Documentation Points:
1. The function's docstring explicitly states it should return ranges that "cover all the characters in |s|"
2. The function is used by Any(s) and AnyBut(s) functions which are documented as:
   - Any(s): "Any(s) is an RE which matches any character in the string |s|."
   - AnyBut(s): "AnyBut(s) is an RE which matches any character (including newline) which is not in the string |s|."
3. The function is part of the Cython.Plex.Regexps module used for building regular expressions in lexical analyzers

External Documentation Search:
- Could not find specific external documentation for the chars_to_ranges function beyond the source code
- Cython Plex is a lexical analysis system, but detailed documentation for this specific utility function is not publicly available
- The function appears to be an internal utility function

Function Purpose and Expected Behavior:
Based on the docstring and usage context:
- The function should take a string of characters
- It should return a list of character code ranges [start, end) format
- These ranges should cover EXACTLY the characters present in the input string
- No additional characters should be included in the ranges

The documentation is clear that the ranges should cover "all the characters in |s|" - this implies:
1. All characters in the input should be covered (completeness)
2. Only characters in the input should be covered (no extras)

The bug report's claim that the function covers extra characters not present in the input would violate the documented contract of covering exactly "the characters in |s|".
