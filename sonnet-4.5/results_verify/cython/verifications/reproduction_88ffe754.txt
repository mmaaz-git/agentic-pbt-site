## Bug Reproduction Report

### Hypothesis Test Results
The Hypothesis property-based test confirmed the bug. When run with any dictionary input (including an empty dict or {'x': 0}), the test failed with:
- AssertionError: substitute() mutated input dict: added {'__template_name__'}

This confirms that the substitute() method adds '__template_name__' to the input dictionary.

### Simple Reproduction
The simple example provided in the bug report was reproduced successfully:
- Input dict before: {'x': 42}
- Input dict after: {'x': 42, '__template_name__': 'test.txt'}

The dictionary gained the '__template_name__' key after calling substitute().

### Additional Testing - Template Code Mutation
I discovered that template code can also mutate the input dictionary:
- Template: "{{py:x=100}}Modified: {{x}}"
- Input dict before: {'x': 42}
- Input dict after: {'x': 100, '__template_name__': 'test.txt'}

The template code changed the value of 'x' from 42 to 100 in the original dictionary.

### Root Cause Analysis
Looking at the source code (lines 182-183 in _tempita.py):
```python
ns = kw  # This creates an alias, not a copy
ns['__template_name__'] = self.name  # This mutates the original dict
```

The code uses `ns = kw` which creates an alias to the input dictionary, not a copy. Any modifications to `ns` directly modify the caller's dictionary. This is clearly a bug that causes unexpected side effects.
