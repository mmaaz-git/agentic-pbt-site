## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior is not documented, and there's no specification stating that command-level options must override extension-level options for boolean flags. The use of `or` operators for boolean flags might be intentional design to enable features from either source. The pattern has existed in both old and new implementations consistently, suggesting this is expected behavior rather than a bug. Without documentation explicitly stating the precedence rules, the current implementation defines the behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code comments in the module suggest that command-line options should be processed first and take precedence. Standard Python distutils convention is that command-line options override other sources. The bug report accurately describes a real limitation where command-level=0 cannot override extension-level=1, which could be considered incorrect based on typical precedence expectations.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The module is explicitly deprecated (line 6: "Note that this module is deprecated"). The same pattern exists in the modern build_ext.py, suggesting this might be intentional legacy behavior that won't be changed. The use case of setting command-level=0 to override extension-level=1 for boolean flags is likely extremely rare in practice. Fixing this would require changing long-standing behavior in deprecated code that users are advised not to use.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even deprecated modules should maintain correct behavior while they exist. The modern build_ext has the same issue, so fixing it there would be valuable. The bug represents a genuine logical inconsistency that prevents proper option precedence, which could affect users still using this module.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify how boolean option precedence works with the `or` operator pattern. The current behavior (any True wins) might be intentional but undocumented. Adding documentation to clarify that boolean options use "any True wins" semantics rather than strict precedence would resolve the confusion without changing code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The module is deprecated and users are directed to use cythonize() instead, so documenting deprecated behavior might not be worthwhile. The code comments suggest command-line should take precedence, so the documentation would be documenting incorrect behavior rather than clarifying intended behavior.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current code doesn't support the ability to explicitly set command-level=0 to override extension-level=1, which could be seen as a missing feature. Implementing proper precedence handling would be a new capability rather than fixing broken functionality. The request is essentially asking for a different precedence model than what currently exists.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report frames this as incorrect existing behavior rather than requesting new functionality. Standard distutils precedence conventions suggest this should already work, making it a bug rather than a feature request. The code comments imply this precedence should already exist.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code comments explicitly state "Start with the command line option" suggesting command-line should have precedence, but the implementation violates this with the `or` operator. Standard Python packaging tools follow the precedence: command-line > config > defaults, which this violates. The bug report accurately identifies a real technical issue where command-level values cannot override extension-level values when the command value is falsy.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The module is deprecated and this behavior has existed unchanged for years in both old and new implementations. The "any True wins" semantics might be intentional for boolean flags to allow enabling features from multiple sources. Without explicit documentation stating the expected behavior, the current implementation defines the behavior. The severity is marked as "Low" even by the reporter, and affects an edge case in deprecated code.

## Overall Consideration

The bug report accurately identifies a technical limitation where command-level 0/False values cannot override extension-level 1/True values due to the use of `or` operators. This pattern exists in both the deprecated old_build_ext and the current build_ext modules, suggesting it might be long-standing intended behavior rather than a bug. The module is explicitly deprecated with users directed to use cythonize() instead.

The key issue is the lack of documentation about the intended precedence model for boolean options. While standard distutils convention suggests command-line options should override all others, the consistent use of `or` operators across both old and new implementations suggests "any True wins" might be the intended semantics for these boolean flags. This makes sense for boolean enable/disable flags where you might want to enable a feature from either the command line or extension configuration.

Given that the module is deprecated, the use case is extremely narrow (explicitly setting command-level=0 to override extension-level=1), and the same pattern exists in the modern implementation suggesting it might be intentional, this should be closed as WONTFIX. Even if this were considered incorrect behavior, fixing it in deprecated code that users are explicitly told not to use would provide minimal value while potentially breaking existing code that relies on the current "any True wins" semantics.
