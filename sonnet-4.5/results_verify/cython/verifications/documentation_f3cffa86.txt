DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION SEARCH:
- No specific documentation found on cython.readthedocs.io for Cython.Plex.Range()
- Plex appears to be an internal/utility module for lexical analysis
- General Plex documentation at pythonhosted.org mentions it's for building lexical analyzers but doesn't document Range()
- This appears to be an internal utility function without extensive public documentation

SOURCE CODE DOCSTRING:
From the function definition in Cython/Plex/Regexps.py:
"""
Range(c1, c2) is an RE which matches any single character in the range
|c1| to |c2| inclusive.
Range(s) where |s| is a string of even length is an RE which matches
any single character in the ranges |s[0]| to |s[1]|, |s[2]| to |s[3]|,...
"""

KEY DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:

1. EXPLICIT REQUIREMENT:
   - The docstring explicitly states "where |s| is a string of even length"
   - This is a clear precondition for the single-argument form of Range()

2. NO ERROR HANDLING SPECIFIED:
   - The documentation doesn't specify what should happen with odd-length strings
   - No mention of expected exceptions or error messages
   - The behavior for invalid input is undefined in the documentation

3. INTERNAL MODULE STATUS:
   - Cython.Plex appears to be primarily an internal module for Cython's own lexical analysis
   - Limited public-facing documentation suggests it's not primarily intended as a public API
   - However, it is importable and used by external code

4. CONTRACT IMPLICATIONS:
   - The docstring establishes a clear contract: even-length strings only
   - When a precondition is violated, good practice is to fail fast with a clear error
   - Current behavior (IndexError) doesn't communicate the contract violation clearly

CONCLUSION:
The documentation clearly states the even-length requirement but doesn't specify error handling behavior. The current IndexError is technically not wrong (undefined behavior), but providing a clear ValueError would be more helpful and align with Python conventions for input validation.
