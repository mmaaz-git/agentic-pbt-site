## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. The function's docstring explicitly states its purpose is to filter out names like ".0"
2. The function fails to filter these names when passed as regular strings
3. The behavior is inconsistent - the same logical value (".0") produces different results based on type
4. The GitHub issue #5552 confirms these names cause crashes and must be filtered
5. The fix is straightforward and matches the documented intent

**Likelihood: VERY HIGH**

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. Could argue the function only needs to handle `EncodedString` types since that's what the compiler uses internally
2. However, this is weak because the docstring doesn't specify type restrictions

**Likelihood: VERY LOW**

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. If the function is only ever called with `EncodedString` in practice, the bug might never manifest
2. However, the inconsistency is still a correctness issue and the fix is trivial

**Likelihood: LOW**

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation could be updated to say "only works with EncodedString inputs"
2. However, this would be counter to the clear intent expressed in the docstring
3. The docstring explicitly describes what names should be filtered, not what types

**Likelihood: LOW**

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could argue that supporting regular strings is a new feature
2. However, the function already accepts regular strings - it just doesn't validate them correctly
3. This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new capability

**Likelihood: VERY LOW**

### Final Assessment:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has a documented purpose (filter names like ".0") that it fails to fulfill for regular string inputs. The inconsistent behavior between `str` and `EncodedString` types violates the principle of least surprise and the documented intent. The proposed fix correctly implements the documented behavior for all string types.
