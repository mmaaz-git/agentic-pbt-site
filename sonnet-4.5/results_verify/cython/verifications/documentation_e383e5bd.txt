## Documentation Analysis

### Cython.Tempita.bunch Documentation

The `bunch` class has NO documentation. Neither the class nor its methods have docstrings. The source code shows:
- Line 392: `class bunch(dict):` - no docstring
- No inline comments explaining the intended behavior
- Listed in `__all__` (line 41) as a public API, but without documentation

### Python's dir() Documentation

According to Python's official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir):

1. **Purpose**: "Return a list of valid attributes for an object"

2. **Behavior with custom __dir__**:
   - "If the object has a method named `__dir__()`, this method will be called"
   - The method "must return the list of attributes"

3. **Default behavior without __dir__**:
   - "The function tries its best to gather information from the object's `__dict__` attribute (if defined), and from its type object"
   - For dict subclasses, this means dict methods but NOT dictionary keys

4. **Expected contract**:
   - The documentation states dir() returns "valid attributes"
   - Attributes accessible via `getattr()` should be considered valid

### Introspection Protocol Analysis

Python's introspection protocol consists of:
- `hasattr(obj, name)` - checks if an attribute exists
- `getattr(obj, name)` - retrieves an attribute
- `dir(obj)` - lists available attributes

The expectation is consistency: if `hasattr(obj, 'x')` is True and `getattr(obj, 'x')` works, then 'x' should appear in `dir(obj)`.

### Similar Classes in Python

Standard library classes that mix dictionary and attribute access (like `argparse.Namespace`) DO include their attributes in `dir()`:

```python
from argparse import Namespace
ns = Namespace(x=1, y=2)
assert 'x' in dir(ns)  # This passes
```

### Conclusion on Documentation

1. **No specification exists** for how `bunch` should handle `dir()`
2. **Python's dir() documentation** indicates it should return "valid attributes"
3. **Common practice** in Python is that accessible attributes appear in `dir()`
4. The bug report's assumption that attributes should appear in `dir()` is **reasonable** based on:
   - Python's documentation saying dir() returns "valid attributes"
   - Standard library precedent
   - General Python introspection protocol expectations

The lack of explicit documentation about `bunch`'s introspection behavior means we must rely on Python's general conventions and the principle of least surprise.
