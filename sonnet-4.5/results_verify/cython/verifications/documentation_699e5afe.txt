## Documentation Analysis for is_valid_tag

### Function Documentation
The function has a clear docstring that states:
```
Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments
to functions creating generator expressions,
however they are not identifiers.

See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5552
```

### GitHub Issue #5552 Context
The referenced GitHub issue reveals important context:
1. **Problem Origin**: When using Cython with `--gdb` debug flag, generator expressions create internal arguments with names like '.0', '.1', etc.
2. **Technical Issue**: The lxml library considers these invalid XML tag names, causing crashes
3. **Design Decision**: These '.0' style names are intentionally used by Cython as internal argument names for generator expressions, mimicking Python's behavior
4. **Solution Intent**: The is_valid_tag function was created to filter out these invalid names from debug output

### Documentation Interpretation
1. The docstring explicitly states that names like '.0' "are not identifiers" - meaning they should be considered invalid tags
2. The function's purpose is to prevent these internal names from being used as XML tags in debug output
3. The documentation does NOT specify that the behavior should differ based on string type (regular vs EncodedString)

### Expected Behavior Based on Documentation
According to the documentation, the function should:
- Return False for any name matching the pattern '.<decimal>' (like '.0', '.123')
- This should be consistent regardless of the input string type
- The purpose is to filter out these names before they reach the XML builder

### Conclusion
The documentation supports the bug report's claim. The function's docstring clearly indicates that '.0' style names should be rejected as invalid, but the current implementation only does this for EncodedString instances, not regular strings. This inconsistency is not documented or intended based on the available documentation and issue history.
