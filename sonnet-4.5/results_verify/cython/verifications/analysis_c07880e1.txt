BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Triage Category Considerations

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The function has clear implementation errors: it uses the wrong variable (global instead of parameter) and is missing a return statement
- The function signature suggests it should process and return the input, but it doesn't
- The bugs are objective and verifiable - the function literally doesn't use its parameter and doesn't return anything

**Arguments Against:**
- The function is never actually called anywhere in the codebase (dead code)
- It doesn't affect any actual functionality since it's unused
- It might have been intentionally left incomplete

### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- The function is dead code that's never called, so fixing it has no practical impact
- It's in a test file and doesn't affect production code
- The effort to fix unused code may not be worthwhile
- It appears to be an abandoned helper method that was never completed

**Arguments Against:**
- The bugs are still genuine coding errors
- Dead code with bugs can be confusing to maintainers
- Someone might try to use this function in the future and encounter the bugs

### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- Since there's no documentation specifying what the function should do, we can't definitively say it's "wrong"
- The function might have been intentionally left as a stub or placeholder
- Without documentation, the expected behavior is undefined

**Arguments Against:**
- The function name and parameter name strongly suggest intended behavior
- The implementation clearly attempts to do something but fails due to obvious bugs
- Using a parameter name but then ignoring it is clearly a mistake

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue the issue is lack of documentation about this being dead/incomplete code

**Arguments Against:**
- The primary issue is the buggy implementation, not documentation
- Adding documentation for broken, unused code doesn't make sense

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be reframed as "implement a working whitespace correction function"

**Arguments Against:**
- The function already exists with an implementation, it's just buggy
- This is clearly a bug fix, not a new feature

## Key Factors
1. **Dead Code**: The function is never called anywhere in the codebase
2. **Test Code**: This is in a test file, not production code
3. **Clear Bugs**: Parameter ignored, missing return statement
4. **No Documentation**: No specification of expected behavior
5. **Obvious Intent**: The function name and structure make the intended purpose clear

## Recommendation
This should be categorized as **WONTFIX**. While the bugs are real and the code is clearly incorrect, the function is dead code that's never called anywhere. It's in a test file and has no impact on any functionality. The bugs are in an abandoned, incomplete helper method that appears to have been left unfinished. Fixing dead code provides no value to users or developers.

If someone needs this functionality in the future, they would likely write a new, working implementation rather than trying to use this broken, undocumented method.
