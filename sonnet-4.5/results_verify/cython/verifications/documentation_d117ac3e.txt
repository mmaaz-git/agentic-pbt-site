## Documentation Analysis

### Source Code Review

The `bunch` class is implemented in `/Cython/Tempita/_tempita.py` and is a subclass of `dict`. The complete implementation shows:

```python
class bunch(dict):
    def __init__(self, **kw):
        for name, value in kw.items():
            setattr(self, name, value)

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        self[name] = value

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        try:
            return self[name]
        except KeyError:
            raise AttributeError(name)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if 'default' in self:
            try:
                return dict.__getitem__(self, key)
            except KeyError:
                return dict.__getitem__(self, 'default')
        else:
            return dict.__getitem__(self, key)

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<%s %s>' % (
            self.__class__.__name__,
            ' '.join(['%s=%r' % (k, v) for k, v in sorted(self.items())]))
```

**Key observation**: The class does NOT implement `__delattr__`.

### Documentation Review

1. **Tempita Documentation**: The official Tempita documentation describes `bunch` as "a dictionary that also lets you use attributes." The documentation shows examples of setting and getting attributes but makes no mention of deleting attributes.

2. **Python's help() output**: Shows that `bunch` inherits from `dict` and lists the methods it defines:
   - `__getattr__`
   - `__setattr__`
   - `__getitem__`
   - `__init__`
   - `__repr__`

   Notably absent: `__delattr__`

3. **No explicit documentation about deletion**: Neither the Tempita documentation nor any comments in the source code mention whether attribute deletion is supported or intentionally unsupported.

### Python's Attribute Protocol

According to Python's standard attribute protocol:
- Objects that support `__setattr__` typically should also support `__delattr__`
- The default `__delattr__` from `object` would attempt to delete from the instance's `__dict__`
- Since `bunch` stores attributes in the dictionary (self[name]) rather than the instance `__dict__`, the default `__delattr__` doesn't work correctly

### Conclusion

The documentation does not specify whether `delattr` should or should not work with `bunch` objects. There is no explicit statement that:
1. Attribute deletion is intentionally unsupported
2. Attribute deletion should work
3. The class is meant to be immutable after creation (which it clearly isn't since `setattr` works)

The lack of `__delattr__` implementation appears to be an oversight rather than a documented design decision. The class provides an incomplete implementation of Python's attribute protocol - it supports creating, reading, and modifying attributes but not deleting them.
