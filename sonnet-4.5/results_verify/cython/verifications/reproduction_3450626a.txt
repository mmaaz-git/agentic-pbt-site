REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

TEST RESULTS:
1. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - Created two Python modules: first.py and second.py
   - When using pyximport.install(pyimport=True)
   - Result: first.py was compiled to a .so file (Cython-compiled)
   - Result: second.py remained as a .py file (NOT compiled)
   - This confirms the bug: only the first module gets compiled

2. Hypothesis Property-Based Test:
   - Tested with 2-5 modules
   - Consistently only the first module (mod0) was compiled
   - All subsequent modules (mod1, mod2, etc.) remained uncompiled
   - The test correctly failed with assertion errors

BUG MECHANISM:
The bug is caused by the self.found flag in PyImportMetaFinder class:
- Line 267: self.found is initialized as False
- Lines 270-271: If self.found is True, find_spec returns None immediately
- Line 296: self.found is set to True when first module is found
- The flag is NEVER reset back to False

This means after the first .py module is processed, all subsequent calls to find_spec()
immediately return None, preventing any further .py modules from being compiled.

IMPACT:
The pyimport=True feature is effectively broken for any use case involving
multiple .py modules. Only the very first .py module imported gets compiled,
defeating the documented purpose of "automatically run Cython on every .pyx
and .py module that Python imports".
