## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function is an internal utility without documented input specifications. There's no documentation stating that empty strings should be supported. Users typically don't call resolve_depend directly - they provide depends lists to Extension objects. Empty strings in dependency lists don't make semantic sense, as they don't represent valid file paths or dependencies. The function could reasonably expect non-empty strings as a precondition.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The crash is real and reproducible. The function is called from resolve_depends which iterates over user-provided dependency lists without validation. If users can provide these lists (even indirectly), the function should handle all possible string values gracefully rather than crashing with an obscure error.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Empty dependency strings are nonsensical and would never occur in legitimate use cases. No reasonable user would intentionally put empty strings in their dependency lists. The effort to fix this edge case might not be worth it given its extremely low likelihood of occurring in practice. The function is internal and not part of the public API.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial (adding a simple check) and would prevent crashes. Even if rare, crashes are worse than graceful handling. The error message "string index out of range" gives no useful information to users who might encounter this accidentally. Build systems should be robust against malformed input.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function has no documentation specifying its input requirements. If the expectation is that callers ensure non-empty strings, this should be documented. Adding documentation about valid input formats would clarify the contract and prevent misuse.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is an internal function not meant for direct user consumption. The crash is a code bug, not a documentation issue. Simply documenting "don't pass empty strings" doesn't fix the underlying robustness problem. The code should validate its inputs rather than relying on documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Currently the function doesn't validate inputs, and adding validation could be seen as a new feature. Input validation for dependency strings (checking for empty, malformed, or invalid paths) would be an enhancement to the existing functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is clearly a bug - the code crashes on certain inputs. Not crashing isn't a feature, it's expected behavior. The fix doesn't add new functionality, it just prevents an error condition. Basic input validation to prevent crashes is a bug fix, not a feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with IndexError on empty string input, which is poor error handling. The code makes an unsafe assumption (string is non-empty) without validation. The error could occur through programmatic generation of dependency lists or user error. The fix is simple and makes the code more robust. Crashes in build tools can waste developer time with unclear error messages.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Empty strings as dependencies are meaningless and should never occur. This is an internal function not documented for public use. The real bug might be in whatever code is passing empty strings, not in this function. The scenario is extremely unlikely in real-world usage.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report represents a classic edge case in input validation. The resolve_depend function makes an unchecked assumption that input strings are non-empty, leading to an IndexError when this assumption is violated. While empty dependency strings are semantically meaningless and unlikely in practice, the question is whether internal utility functions should validate their inputs.

The key factors to consider are: (1) The function is internal but can receive user-provided data indirectly through the build system, (2) The fix is trivial and would make the code more robust, (3) The current error message is unhelpful for debugging, and (4) Empty strings could arise from programmatic list generation or parsing errors even if not intentionally provided.

Given that this is an internal utility function that users don't directly call, and empty dependency strings make no semantic sense in any build context, this falls into the category of "technically a bug but practically irrelevant." The most appropriate classification would be WONTFIX - while the crash is real, it represents such an unlikely edge case in an internal function that fixing it provides minimal value. Build system users should never have empty strings in their dependency lists, and if they do, the problem lies with their build configuration, not with Cython's handling of it.
