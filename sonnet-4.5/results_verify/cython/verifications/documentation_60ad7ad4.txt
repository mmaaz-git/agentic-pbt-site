## Documentation Analysis for restore_Options function

The `restore_Options` function in Cython.Compiler.Tests.Utils has minimal documentation. The only documentation found is:

1. **Code comment at line 21**: "# strip Options from new keys that might have been added:"
   This comment indicates the intent of the problematic code section - to remove any new attributes that were added to the Options object after the backup was taken.

2. **Function signature and implementation**: The function has no docstring, but from the code it's clear that:
   - It takes a backup dictionary (created by `backup_Options()`)
   - It restores all the original values from the backup
   - It removes any new keys that were added to Options since the backup

3. **Related function `check_global_options`**: Has a docstring stating "returns error message of "" if check Ok", suggesting these utilities are designed for testing purposes to ensure Options state is properly managed.

4. **Purpose inference**: Based on the module location (Cython/Compiler/Tests/Utils.py), these are test utility functions meant to backup and restore the global Options state during testing, ensuring tests don't interfere with each other.

5. **No external documentation found**: There is no README, API documentation, or other documentation that specifies:
   - How the function should handle dictionary iteration
   - What exceptions it should or shouldn't raise
   - Any specific behavior requirements for edge cases

The lack of detailed documentation means the expected behavior must be inferred from:
- The function name (restore_Options should restore the state)
- The code comment (should remove new keys)
- Common Python programming practices (avoiding RuntimeError from dictionary mutation during iteration)
