## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The test runs correctly and confirms that `delattr()` raises an `AttributeError` with the message "'bunch' object has no attribute 'a'" when attempting to delete an existing attribute.

2. **Simple Reproduction**: The simple example code confirms the behavior:
   - Creating a bunch with attributes works: `tempita.bunch(x=1, y=2)`
   - Reading attributes works: `b.x` returns the value
   - Modifying attributes works: `b.x = 10` successfully updates the value
   - Setting new attributes works: `setattr(b, 'z', 100)` successfully adds a new attribute
   - Getting attributes works: `getattr(b, 'y')` returns the value
   - **Deleting attributes FAILS**: Both `delattr(b, 'x')` and `del b.x` raise `AttributeError: 'bunch' object has no attribute 'x'`

### Bug Confirmation

The bug is real and reproducible. The `bunch` class has an inconsistent implementation of Python's attribute protocol:

1. It supports `__setattr__` (allows `b.x = value` and `setattr(b, 'x', value)`)
2. It supports `__getattr__` (allows `b.x` and `getattr(b, 'x')`)
3. It does NOT properly support `__delattr__` (fails on `del b.x` and `delattr(b, 'x')`)

The error message "'bunch' object has no attribute 'x'" is misleading because the attribute clearly exists (we can read and modify it). The real issue is that `__delattr__` is not implemented or is improperly implemented.

This creates an asymmetric API where attributes can be created and modified but not removed, which violates Python's standard object model expectations.
