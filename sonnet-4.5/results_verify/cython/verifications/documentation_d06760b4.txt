Documentation Analysis for pyximport.get_distutils_extension
============================================================

## Function Documentation

The function `get_distutils_extension(modname, pyxfilename, language_level=None)` has minimal documentation:
- No docstring is provided for this function
- The function signature shows three parameters: modname, pyxfilename, and language_level
- No parameter type annotations are provided

## Implied Behavior from Code

From examining the source code (pyximport.py lines 90-107), the function:
1. Takes a module name (modname) and a pyxfilename as required parameters
2. Has optional language_level parameter
3. Returns a tuple of (extension_mod, setup_args)

## Type Handling in the Code

The code contains explicit logic at lines 99-102 that attempts to handle non-string types:
```python
if not isinstance(pyxfilename, str):
    # distutils is stupid in Py2 and requires exactly 'str'
    # => encode accidentally coerced unicode strings back to str
    pyxfilename = pyxfilename.encode(sys.getfilesystemencoding())
```

This comment and code suggest the function was intended to handle non-string types, specifically unicode strings in Python 2.

## distutils.extension.Extension Requirements

According to Python documentation, distutils.extension.Extension expects:
- sources parameter to be a list of strings (file paths)
- Paths should be strings in Unix format (slash-separated)
- Modern setuptools accepts `Iterable[str | os.PathLike[str]]`

## Documentation Findings

1. **No explicit documentation** states what types pyxfilename should accept
2. **The code itself** suggests non-string types were considered (with the isinstance check)
3. **The comment** indicates this was for Python 2 unicode/str handling
4. **No documentation** explicitly forbids bytes or Path objects
5. **No documentation** explicitly supports bytes or Path objects

## Conclusion

The function lacks proper documentation about accepted input types. The presence of type-handling code suggests the function was intended to be flexible with input types, but the implementation is broken for Python 3. This is neither clearly documented behavior nor clearly forbidden behavior - it's an implementation detail that has become broken due to Python 2 to 3 migration.
