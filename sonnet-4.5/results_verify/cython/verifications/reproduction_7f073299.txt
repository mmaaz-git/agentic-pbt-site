REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is confirmed to exist.

## Reproduction Method

1. Tested the exact code provided in the bug report
2. Ran property-based tests with Hypothesis
3. Created additional test cases to verify the issue

## Key Findings

The `is_valid_tag` function in Cython.Debugger.DebugWriter has the following behavior:

1. **For tags starting with digits (e.g., "0tag", "1variable", "9name")**:
   - `is_valid_tag()` returns `True` (indicating they are valid)
   - But XML's TreeBuilder.start() method rejects them with `ValueError: Invalid tag name`

2. **For the documented case of generator arguments (e.g., ".0", ".1")**:
   - `is_valid_tag()` correctly returns `False` when using EncodedString
   - This is the only case the function currently handles

3. **Inconsistency Issue**:
   - The function's docstring states it filters out invalid identifiers
   - It only checks for one specific pattern (".0", ".1", etc.)
   - It fails to check XML naming rules (tags cannot start with digits)
   - This causes a mismatch where `is_valid_tag` says a name is valid, but XML rejects it

## Impact

When `is_valid_tag("0tag")` returns `True`, code using this function assumes the tag name is safe to use with XML. However, when `writer.start("0tag")` is called, it throws a `ValueError`, breaking the expected contract of the validation function.

The bug is real and reproducible - the function does not properly validate XML tag names according to XML specifications.
