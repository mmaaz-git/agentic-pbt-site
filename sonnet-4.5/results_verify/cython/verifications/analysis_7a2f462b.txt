## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### 1. INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The docstring doesn't explicitly promise the output will be a valid float
- The docstring only shows positive number examples
- One could argue the function only promises "string comparisons" not float parsing

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The test suite explicitly checks `float(float_str) == float(result)`
- This establishes a clear contract that the output must be parseable
- The function is used in production code that expects valid float representations
- The bug produces objectively malformed output (minus sign in wrong position)

**Verdict: NOT INVALID**

#### 2. WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Negative scientific notation with negative exponents is a rare edge case
- The function might not be intended for public use (internal utility)
- Existing code might only use it with positive numbers

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The bug produces completely invalid output that crashes with ValueError
- It's not an obscure precision issue but a fundamental parsing failure
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality
- The function accepts negative numbers in other formats that work correctly

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX**

#### 3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The docstring doesn't mention negative number support
- Examples only show positive numbers
- One could document "only works with positive numbers"

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The function already handles some negative numbers correctly (e.g., -1.0, -123.456)
- The test suite implies all valid floats should work
- The bug is in the implementation logic, not a documentation mismatch
- Restricting to positive numbers would be a regression from current partial support

**Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX**

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting negative scientific notation could be seen as a new feature
- The original implementation might have only targeted positive numbers

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The function already accepts negative numbers (just handles some incorrectly)
- Python's float() accepts negative scientific notation as standard
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The test contract already implies this should work

**Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST**

#### 5. BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
- The function produces invalid, unparseable output for valid input
- It violates the contract established by its own test suite
- The output has the minus sign in an objectively wrong position
- Some negative numbers work while others fail inconsistently
- The fix corrects a clear logic error in sign handling
- The function is used in production code that expects valid output

**Verdict: THIS IS A BUG**

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function:
1. Accepts valid float strings as input
2. Produces invalid, unparseable strings as output
3. Violates its test suite's explicit contract
4. Has inconsistent behavior (works for some negative numbers, fails for others)
5. Contains an obvious logic error in handling the negative sign

The bug is not a matter of interpretation or missing features - it's a straightforward implementation error that produces objectively incorrect output.
