## Documentation Analysis for normalise_float_repr

### Function Documentation
The function has a docstring that states:
```
Generate a 'normalised', simple digits string representation of a float value
to allow string comparisons. Examples: '.123', '123.456', '123.'
```

This indicates the function's purpose is to create a normalized string representation of floats that can be used for string comparisons.

### Test Suite Documentation
The existing test suite in TestCythonUtils.py (lines 194-202) explicitly verifies that:
1. `float(float_str) == float(result)` - The normalized result must parse back to the same float value as the original input
2. The test includes various test cases with scientific notation, including:
   - Positive exponents (e.g., '1E5' -> '100000.')
   - Small negative exponents (e.g., '.1E-5' -> '.000001', '123.456E-2' -> '1.23456')
   - Large positive exponents (e.g., '2.1E80')

### Usage Context
The function is used in Cython/Compiler/ExprNodes.py for processing float values in DEF statements, where precision matters for compile-time constants.

### External Documentation
- No external documentation was found in the official Cython documentation
- The function does not appear in the public Cython GitHub repository search
- This appears to be an internal utility function

### Expected Behavior Based on Tests
Based on the existing test cases and the assertion `float(float_str) == float(result)`, the function must maintain the following invariant:
- **The normalized string representation must be parseable as a float and equal to the original float value**

This is a fundamental requirement verified by line 198 in the test suite: `self.assertEqual(float(float_str), float(result))`

### Conclusion
The documentation (via docstring and tests) clearly establishes that:
1. The function should normalize float representations for string comparison
2. The normalized output must be parseable as a float
3. The parsed value must equal the original float value

The bug violates this documented contract by producing outputs that either cannot be parsed as floats or parse to completely different values.
