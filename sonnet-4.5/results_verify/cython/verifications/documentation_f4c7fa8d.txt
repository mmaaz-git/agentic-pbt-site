DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Status:
- The restore_Options and backup_Options functions are internal test utility functions in Cython.Compiler.Tests.Utils
- No public documentation exists for these functions
- No docstrings are present in the code

Function Intent (from code analysis):
1. backup_Options(): Creates a backup dictionary of all attributes in the Options module
   - Special handling for '_directive_defaults' which is deep-copied
   - Returns a dictionary with all Options attributes

2. restore_Options(backup): Restores Options module to a previous state
   - Restores all attributes to their backed-up values
   - Has explicit comment on line 21: "# strip Options from new keys that might have been added:"
   - This comment clearly indicates the function's intent to remove newly-added attributes

Usage Context:
- Used in test setUp/tearDown methods in TestCmdLine.py and TestCythonizeArgsParser.py
- Pattern: backup in setUp(), restore in tearDown() to ensure test isolation
- Prevents test contamination by ensuring Options module is reset between tests

Contract Analysis:
The code and its usage pattern establish an implicit contract:
1. backup_Options() captures the complete state of Options
2. restore_Options() must restore Options to exactly that state, including:
   - Restoring modified values
   - Removing any newly-added attributes

The comment "strip Options from new keys that might have been added" explicitly states this behavior is intended, not accidental. Therefore, the current implementation failing to fulfill this contract (by crashing with RuntimeError) is a genuine bug.
