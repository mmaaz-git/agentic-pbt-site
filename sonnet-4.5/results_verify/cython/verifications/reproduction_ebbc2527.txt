## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The function `is_valid_tag` in Cython.Debugger.DebugWriter exhibits inconsistent behavior depending on the input type.

### Test Results:

1. **Manual reproduction confirmed:**
   - `is_valid_tag('.0')` with regular str: Returns `True` (incorrect)
   - `is_valid_tag('.123')` with regular str: Returns `True` (incorrect)
   - `is_valid_tag(EncodedString('.0'))`: Returns `False` (correct)
   - `is_valid_tag(EncodedString('.123'))`: Returns `False` (correct)

2. **Hypothesis test confirmed:**
   - The property-based test fails immediately on the first example `.0`
   - The test expects `False` but gets `True` when passing a regular string

### The Effect:

The function's behavior is inconsistent based on the type of the input:
- When passed a regular Python `str` that starts with "." followed by decimal digits (e.g., ".0", ".123"), the function returns `True`, indicating these are valid tags
- When passed the same values as `EncodedString` objects, the function correctly returns `False`

This means that names like ".0" which are explicitly mentioned in the docstring as internal generator expression arguments that should be filtered out, are only filtered when wrapped in EncodedString, not when they are regular strings.

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
