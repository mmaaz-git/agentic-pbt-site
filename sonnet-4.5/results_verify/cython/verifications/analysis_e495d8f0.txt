# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Considering BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments For:**
1. The code clearly intends to filter already-typed function names (variable named `seen`)
2. The Python slice behavior `text[:-0]` returning empty string is a known quirk
3. The bug causes duplicate completions which is poor UX
4. The fix is simple and correct
5. The logic failure is clear and reproducible
6. The implementation doesn't match the apparent intent

**Arguments Against:**
- None significant

## Considering INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that the documentation doesn't explicitly promise no duplicates

**Arguments Against:**
1. The code clearly tries to filter duplicates (the `seen` set and `n not in seen` check)
2. Variable naming and logic indicate clear intent
3. No reasonable user would expect duplicate completions
4. The bug is due to a Python language quirk, not intentional design

## Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
1. Bug severity is marked as "Low" in the report
2. Only occurs when `word` is empty (specific edge case)
3. Users can work around by typing more characters

**Arguments Against:**
1. This happens at a common completion point (after typing a complete function name)
2. The fix is trivial (3 lines of code)
3. It's a legitimate logic error, not an obscure corner case
4. Affects user experience in normal usage

## Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could argue filtering duplicates is a new feature

**Arguments Against:**
1. The code already attempts to filter duplicates
2. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capability
3. The `seen` set and filtering logic already exist

## Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- Could document that duplicates may appear in completions

**Arguments Against:**
1. The code intent is clearly to filter duplicates
2. This would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it
3. The issue is in the implementation, not the documentation

## Conclusion
This is a **BUG**:

1. **Clear Logic Error**: The code uses `text[:-len(word)]` which fails when `len(word)==0` due to Python's `[:-0]` returning empty string
2. **Intent vs Implementation Mismatch**: The code clearly intends to track "seen" names and filter them
3. **Real User Impact**: Users get duplicate suggestions when completing at word boundaries
4. **Simple Fix Available**: The proposed fix correctly handles the edge case
5. **Not a Feature Request**: The filtering functionality already exists but is broken
6. **Not Documentation Issue**: The code's intent is clear from variable names and logic

The bug represents a failure of the existing implementation to handle a specific but common case (empty word parameter) due to a Python language quirk. This is exactly what bug reports are for - identifying where implementation doesn't match intent.
