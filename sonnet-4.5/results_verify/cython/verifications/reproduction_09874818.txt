REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR strip_common_indent BUG

1. Bug Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED
The bug described in the report is technically accurate and reproducible.

2. Test Case Results:

Test 1 - Basic Example:
Input: '        code1\n#comment\n        code2'
Expected output lines: ['code1', '#comment', 'code2']
Actual output lines: ['code1', '', 'code2']
Result: The comment '#comment' is completely lost and becomes an empty string

Test 2 - Property Test:
With indent=8 and comment_text='comment'
Input: '        code1\n#comment\n        code2'
Expected: Comment line should be '#comment'
Actual: Comment line is ''
Result: Fails - comment is lost

3. Root Cause Analysis (Verified):
The bug report's technical analysis is CORRECT:

a) In the first loop (lines 411-419):
   - The variable 'indent' gets set to match.start() for each non-comment line
   - After processing all lines, 'indent' retains the value from the LAST non-comment line processed
   - In our test case, indent=8 (from the last line '        code2')

b) In the second loop (lines 420-424):
   - Line 422 checks: line[indent:indent+1] == '#'
   - For the comment line '#comment', this checks line[8:9]
   - Since '#comment' has length 8, line[8:9] is out of bounds and returns ''
   - The check fails, so the comment is NOT skipped
   - Line 424 executes: lines[ix] = line[min_indent:]
   - This becomes: '#comment'[8:] = '' (empty string)

4. Fix Validation:
The proposed fix was tested and works correctly:
- Original: line[indent:indent+1] == '#'
- Fixed: (match and line[match.start()] == '#')

This correctly identifies comment lines by checking the first non-space character of the CURRENT line, not using a stale variable.

5. Bug Impact:
- Comments at the beginning of lines (no indentation) get truncated or deleted when code has indentation >= comment length
- This data loss is silent - no error is raised
- The function fails to preserve the structure of the input code
