## Reproduction of Bug

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. When calling `parse_list('["]')`, the function raises a `KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'` exactly as reported.

### Steps taken to reproduce:

1. Ran the exact code provided in the bug report:
   ```python
   from Cython.Build.Dependencies import parse_list
   result = parse_list('["]')
   ```

2. Confirmed the exact error and stack trace:
   - Error type: KeyError
   - Error message: '__Pyx_L1'
   - Location: Dependencies.py line 132 in the unquote function

### Root cause analysis:

Through debugging, I identified the exact mechanism of the bug:

1. When `parse_list('["]')` is called, the brackets are stripped leaving just `"`
2. `strip_string_literals('"')` treats this as an unclosed string literal
3. It creates a placeholder `"__Pyx_L1_` and maps `__Pyx_L1_` (with underscore) to an empty string
4. The `unquote` function receives `"__Pyx_L1_` and tries to lookup `literal[1:-1]` which is `__Pyx_L1` (without trailing underscore)
5. Since `__Pyx_L1` doesn't exist in the literals dict (only `__Pyx_L1_` exists), a KeyError is raised

### Additional findings:

I discovered that the bug also occurs with other inputs:
- `[""]` (empty string in quotes) raises `KeyError: ''`
- `[a, ""]` (mixed content with empty string) also raises `KeyError: ''`

The bug is consistently reproducible and represents a real issue in the parse_list function's handling of certain quoted strings.
