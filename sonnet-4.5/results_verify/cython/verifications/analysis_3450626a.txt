BUG CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
===========================

Evaluating this bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID
   Arguments against:
   - The bug is real and reproducible
   - The code behavior contradicts documentation
   - The test cases correctly demonstrate the issue
   Arguments for:
   - None - this is clearly a valid bug

2. WONTFIX
   Arguments against:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - it affects ALL uses with multiple modules
   - The bug completely breaks the feature for its intended use case
   - The fix is simple and straightforward (remove 4 lines of code)
   Arguments for:
   - The feature is marked as "experimental"
   - However, experimental doesn't mean "fundamentally broken"

3. FEATURE_REQUEST
   Arguments against:
   - The user isn't asking for new functionality
   - The documentation already promises this behavior
   - This is fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new features
   Arguments for:
   - None - the functionality is already documented

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   Arguments against:
   - The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
   - The code is wrong, not the documentation
   - Changing docs to say "only compiles first module" would make feature useless
   Arguments for:
   - None - the documentation is correct

5. BUG
   Arguments for:
   - Clear deviation from documented behavior
   - Feature fails to work as intended for any multi-module use case
   - Reproducible with simple test cases
   - The root cause is clearly identified (incorrect use of self.found flag)
   - The fix is straightforward and correct
   - This affects core functionality of the pyimport=True feature
   Arguments against:
   - Feature is marked experimental (but this doesn't excuse fundamental breakage)

CONCLUSION:
This is clearly a BUG. The self.found flag logic is incorrect and prevents
the pyimport=True feature from working as documented. The bug makes the feature
essentially useless for any real-world scenario involving multiple Python modules.
