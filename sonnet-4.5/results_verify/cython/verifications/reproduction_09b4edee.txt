## Bug Reproduction Results

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction

I successfully ran the provided hypothesis test and confirmed the bug. The test failed with the exact input mentioned in the bug report:
- Input: `start=None, stop=-1, step=None, n=0`
- Expected length: 0 (the length of an empty array slice)
- Actual returned value: -1

The test correctly identifies that `length_of_indexer(slice(None, -1, None), np.arange(0))` returns -1 instead of 0.

### Manual Test Case Reproduction

I ran all the manual test cases provided in the bug report and confirmed the incorrect behavior:

```
slice(None, -1, None): expected 0, got -1
slice(None, -2, None): expected 0, got -2
slice(-1, None, None): expected 0, got 1
slice(0, -1, None): expected 0, got -1
```

I also verified the actual slicing behavior on empty arrays to confirm the expected values:
- `arr[slice(None, -1, None)]` returns an empty array with length 0
- `arr[slice(None, -2, None)]` returns an empty array with length 0
- `arr[slice(-1, None, None)]` returns an empty array with length 0
- `arr[slice(0, -1, None)]` returns an empty array with length 0

### Effect and Impact

The bug is confirmed: `length_of_indexer` returns incorrect values (negative or positive non-zero) when computing the expected length of slice indexing on empty arrays. The function violates its fundamental contract stated in its docstring: "Return the expected length of target[indexer]".

This bug affects any code that relies on `length_of_indexer` to:
1. Pre-allocate arrays before indexing operations
2. Validate operations before performing actual indexing on empty arrays
3. Check expected lengths for array operations

The bug occurs because the function doesn't properly handle negative slice indices when the target array has length 0. When `target_len = 0` and slice indices are negative, the current implementation doesn't ensure that the adjusted indices remain within valid bounds [0, target_len].
