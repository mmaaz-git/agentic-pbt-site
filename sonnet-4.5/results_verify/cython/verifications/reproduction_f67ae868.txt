# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The `_have_importers()` function in pyximport.py fails to correctly detect `PyImportMetaFinder` instances in `sys.meta_path`.

## Reproduction Results

### Source Code Analysis
I examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pyximport/pyximport.py`:

1. Line 222: `class PyxImportMetaFinder(MetaPathFinder):`
2. Line 256: `class PyImportMetaFinder(MetaPathFinder):`

Both classes inherit directly from `MetaPathFinder`, making them sibling classes, not a parent-child relationship.

The buggy `_have_importers()` function (lines 355-365):
```python
def _have_importers():
    has_py_importer = False
    has_pyx_importer = False
    for importer in sys.meta_path:
        if isinstance(importer, PyxImportMetaFinder):
            if isinstance(importer, PyImportMetaFinder):
                has_py_importer = True
            else:
                has_pyx_importer = True
    return has_py_importer, has_pyx_importer
```

The bug is clear: The nested `isinstance` checks assume `PyImportMetaFinder` is a subclass of `PyxImportMetaFinder`, but they are actually sibling classes.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test failed exactly as described in the bug report:
- Failing input: `add_pyx=False, add_py=True`
- Error message: "Expected has_py=True, got False. meta_path types: ['PyImportMetaFinder']"

This confirms that when only a `PyImportMetaFinder` is present, it is not detected.

### Simple Reproduction Results
Running the simple reproduction code confirmed the bug:
```
meta_path contains: PyImportMetaFinder
_have_importers() returned: has_py=False, has_pyx=False
Expected: has_py=True, has_pyx=False
Bug: has_py=False (should be True)
```

### Fix Verification
I tested the proposed fix, which correctly handles all four cases:
1. No importers: has_py=False, has_pyx=False ✓
2. Only PyxImportMetaFinder: has_py=False, has_pyx=True ✓
3. Only PyImportMetaFinder: has_py=True, has_pyx=False ✓ (This was failing before)
4. Both importers: has_py=True, has_pyx=True ✓

## Impact
The bug causes `_have_importers()` to incorrectly report that no `PyImportMetaFinder` is installed when one is present. This would lead to:
1. Duplicate importers being installed when `install(pyimport=True)` is called multiple times
2. Violation of the expected idempotence of the `install()` function
3. Potential performance degradation and unexpected behavior from multiple import hooks

The bug is real, reproducible, and has a clear fix.
