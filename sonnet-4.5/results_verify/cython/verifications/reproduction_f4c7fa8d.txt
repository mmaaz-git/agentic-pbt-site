REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in Cython.Compiler.Tests.Utils.restore_Options.

Test Results:
1. Simple Reproduction Case:
   - Created a backup of Options module
   - Added a new attribute Options.A = "test_value"
   - Called restore_Options(backup)
   - Result: RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
   - The error occurs exactly as described in the bug report

2. Hypothesis Property-Based Test:
   - The property-based test with the specific input (new_attr_name='A', new_value=0) fails with the same RuntimeError
   - The test would fail for any new attribute added to Options after backup

3. Verification of Fix:
   - Created a fixed version using list(vars(Options).keys()) instead of vars(Options).keys()
   - The fixed version successfully removes newly-added attributes without errors
   - This confirms the proposed fix in the bug report is correct

Technical Analysis:
The bug occurs on line 22 of Utils.py where the code iterates over vars(Options).keys() while simultaneously calling delattr() to remove attributes. In Python 3, this raises a RuntimeError because the dictionary is being modified during iteration. This is a well-known Python behavior and the standard fix is to convert the keys to a list before iteration.

The bug is 100% reproducible and affects the core functionality of restore_Options, which is to restore the Options module to its backed-up state by removing any attributes added after the backup was created.
