DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation for parse_list():
--------------------------------
The function has inline doctest documentation showing its intended behavior:
1. It should parse empty strings to empty lists
2. It should parse space-separated values: "a b c" → ['a', 'b', 'c']
3. It should parse comma-separated values in brackets: "[a, b, c]" → ['a', 'b', 'c']
4. It should handle quoted strings with spaces: 'a " " b' → ['a', ' ', 'b']
5. It should handle quoted commas: '[a, ",a", "a,", ",", ]' → ['a', ',a', 'a,', ',']

Usage Context:
--------------
The parse_list function is used in Dependencies.py to parse configuration values from cythonize directives. It's called when processing lines that start with "distutils:" or "cython:" and the configuration value is expected to be a list. The function processes user input from build configuration.

Key Observations:
-----------------
1. The doctest examples only show well-formed input with properly closed quotes
2. There is no documentation about how the function should behave with malformed input
3. There is no documentation stating the function should raise specific exceptions for invalid input
4. The function is meant to parse user-provided configuration strings

The documentation does NOT specify:
- What should happen with unclosed quotes
- What exceptions should be raised for malformed input
- Whether the function should be robust against invalid syntax
- Whether KeyError is an expected exception type

Given that this function processes user input (configuration values), it should reasonably be expected to handle malformed input gracefully rather than crashing with an internal KeyError about implementation details like '__Pyx_L1'.
