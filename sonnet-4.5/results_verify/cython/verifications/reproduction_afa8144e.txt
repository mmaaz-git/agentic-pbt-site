BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

## Summary
I successfully reproduced the bug reported in Cython.Build.Inline.strip_common_indent. The function contains a clear programming error where an undefined variable 'indent' is used in the second loop.

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Property-Based Test**: Ran the hypothesis test with comments-only and blank-lines-only inputs. The test executes without raising a NameError, indicating that the bug doesn't manifest for these specific inputs (the variable 'indent' is never accessed when all lines are blank or comments).

2. **Specific Test Case**: Tested the exact failing input from the bug report:
   ```python
   code = """  x = 1
       y = 2
    #comment
     z = 3"""
   ```

## Results

The function incorrectly processes the comment line:
- Input comment line: ' #comment' (with leading space at position 0)
- Expected output: ' #comment' (preserve the leading space)
- Actual output: 'comment' (incorrectly strips '#' and leading space)

## Root Cause Analysis

The bug occurs in line 422 of Inline.py:
```python
if not match or not line or line[indent:indent+1] == '#':
```

The variable 'indent' is used here but:
1. It's only defined in the FIRST loop (line 415) within the loop scope
2. In the SECOND loop, 'indent' retains the value from the last iteration of the first loop
3. This stale value (2 in our test case) causes incorrect comment detection

For the comment line ' #comment':
- The code checks position 2 (line[2:3]) which is 'c'
- Since 'c' != '#', the line is not recognized as a comment
- The line gets processed and incorrectly trimmed from position min_indent=2
- Result: ' #comment'[2:] = 'comment'

## Bug Verification

Through step-by-step debugging, I confirmed:
1. After first loop: indent=2 (from last processed line 'z = 3')
2. In second loop for ' #comment': checks line[2:3]='c' instead of line[1:2]='#'
3. Comment is not detected, gets incorrectly processed
4. The '#' character and leading space are inadvertently removed

## Conclusion

This is a valid bug. The code uses an undefined/stale variable 'indent' which leads to incorrect behavior when processing comments at different indentation levels than the last non-comment line processed in the first loop.
