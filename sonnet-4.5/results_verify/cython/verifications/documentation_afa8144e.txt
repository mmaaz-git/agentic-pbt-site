DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Documentation Findings

### Official Documentation
1. **No docstring**: The strip_common_indent function in Cython/Build/Inline.py has NO docstring or documentation comments.

2. **No API documentation**: Searches through Cython's official documentation did not reveal any API documentation for this function. It appears to be an internal utility function.

3. **Similar function exists**: A similar strip_common_indent function exists in Cython/Compiler/TreeFragment.py with a docstring:
   ```
   "Strips empty lines and common indentation from the list of strings given in lines"
   ```

### Inferred Purpose from Code Context

Based on code analysis and usage patterns:
- The function is used internally by cython_inline() and cython_compile()
- It's called after strip_string_literals() to normalize code indentation
- Purpose: Remove common leading whitespace from multi-line code strings

### Expected Behavior (Based on Implementation Intent)

From analyzing the code structure, the function appears intended to:
1. Find the minimum indentation of non-blank, non-comment lines
2. Strip that common indentation from ALL lines
3. Preserve relative indentation between lines
4. Skip blank lines and comment lines when calculating minimum indent
5. Still process comment lines in the output (removing common indent if applicable)

### Comment Handling

The code shows clear intent regarding comments:
- First loop: Skip comment lines (those starting with '#' after whitespace) when calculating minimum indent
- Second loop: Should preserve comments but strip common indentation

The bug violates this intent by incorrectly identifying which lines are comments in the second loop.

### Comparison with Similar Functions

Python's textwrap.dedent() provides similar functionality but:
- dedent() processes ALL lines equally
- strip_common_indent() has special handling for comments
- The TreeFragment version filters out empty lines entirely

## Documentation Conclusion

The function lacks formal documentation, but its implementation clearly shows it's meant to:
1. Calculate minimum indentation from code lines (excluding comments/blanks)
2. Apply that indentation removal to all lines
3. Preserve comments while removing their common indentation

The bug causes the function to fail at correctly identifying and preserving comments, violating its apparent design intent.
