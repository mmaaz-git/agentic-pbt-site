## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if the intention was never to support make_setup_args without make_ext. Perhaps the assertion on line 129 was meant to ensure at least one exists for error reporting, but the code path was always intended to require make_ext when processing .pyxbld files.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code explicitly has an assertion "assert ext or setup_args" which clearly indicates that either one should be sufficient. The logical OR operator explicitly allows for ext to be None as long as setup_args exists. This is a clear statement of intended behavior that the subsequent code violates.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be WONTFIX if having make_setup_args without make_ext is an extremely rare use case that no one actually uses in practice. The crash provides a clear error message, and users can easily work around it by providing a minimal make_ext function. The fix might introduce unnecessary complexity for an edge case.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug causes a crash with an unhelpful error message rather than a clear validation error. The fix is trivial (adding an if statement) and doesn't add complexity. The assertion already indicates this was intended to work, so fixing it aligns the code with its own documented intent.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue that the documentation should clarify that make_ext is always required, and the assertion should be updated to match. The current state might be a documentation issue where the code's assertion is wrong, not the subsequent logic.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There's no external documentation stating make_ext is required. The code's assertion is the documentation of intent, and it clearly states either is acceptable. The bug is in the implementation not matching the assertion, not in unclear documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting make_setup_args without make_ext could be viewed as a new feature that was never fully implemented. The assertion might have been aspirational, and completing the implementation would be adding new functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The assertion indicates this was already intended to work - it's not a new feature but a bug in existing code. The code explicitly checks for this case but then fails to handle it properly. This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code contains an explicit assertion that allows ext to be None when setup_args is provided, but then immediately violates this contract by unconditionally accessing ext.sources. This is a clear logic error where the code doesn't handle a case it explicitly claims to support. The fix is simple and correct.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if the assertion was incorrectly written and the actual intent was to always require make_ext. However, there's no evidence for this interpretation, and the assertion's use of OR is unambiguous.

## Overall consideration

This is clearly a BUG. The code has an explicit assertion at line 129 that uses the logical OR operator to state that either `ext` or `setup_args` is sufficient. This is not ambiguous - it's a clear statement that the function should work when only `setup_args` is provided. The very next lines of code then violate this contract by unconditionally accessing `ext.sources`, causing a crash when `ext` is None.

The bug report provides a minimal, reproducible test case that demonstrates the issue. The proposed fix is correct and minimal - it simply adds a conditional check before accessing `ext.sources`, which aligns the implementation with the assertion's documented intent. This is not a documentation issue because the assertion IS the documentation of intended behavior within the code.

While one might argue this is an edge case (using make_setup_args without make_ext), the code explicitly supports it via the assertion, and the fix is trivial. This is a textbook example of a logic bug where code doesn't handle a case it claims to support. The error message ('NoneType' object has no attribute 'sources') is also unhelpful compared to what the assertion would provide if the code required both functions.
