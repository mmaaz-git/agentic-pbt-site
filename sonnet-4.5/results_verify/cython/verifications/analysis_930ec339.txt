# Bug Triage Analysis

## Category Considerations

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence For:**
1. The code behavior contradicts the documented "default namespace" terminology
2. The implementation reverses standard precedence (defaults override runtime values)
3. The documentation references string.Template which has opposite precedence
4. The bug affects core functionality with high severity
5. The fix is straightforward and corrects an obvious logic error
6. Property-based testing confirms systematic failure across all inputs

**Evidence Against:**
- None identified

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Evidence For:**
- None - the bug is reproducible and contradicts expected behavior

**Evidence Against:**
- Bug is consistently reproducible
- Documentation supports the expected behavior
- Standard programming conventions support the expected behavior

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Evidence For:**
- None - this is a significant functionality issue

**Evidence Against:**
- Core functionality affected (template variable substitution)
- High severity - affects all users of namespace feature
- Not an edge case - happens with all namespace/substitute conflicts
- Simple, clear fix available

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Evidence For:**
- None - the expected behavior follows from existing documentation

**Evidence Against:**
- Documentation already describes namespace as "default"
- Reference to string.Template establishes expected behavior
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error)
**Evidence For:**
- Documentation could be more explicit about precedence

**Evidence Against:**
- The documentation correctly describes namespace as "default"
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- "Default" has clear semantic meaning in programming
- Reference to string.Template provides behavioral expectations

## Analysis Summary

The evidence overwhelmingly supports categorizing this as a **BUG**:

1. **Clear Semantic Violation**: "Default namespace" should provide defaults, not overrides
2. **Precedent Violation**: string.Template (referenced model) has opposite precedence
3. **Logic Error**: The code has an obvious implementation mistake (update order)
4. **High Impact**: Affects core functionality for all namespace users
5. **Straightforward Fix**: Simple correction to update order resolves the issue
6. **Systematic Failure**: Not an edge case - fails for all conflicting values

The bug report is well-documented, includes reproducible test cases, identifies the exact problematic code, and provides a correct fix. This is a textbook example of a valid bug report that should be addressed.
