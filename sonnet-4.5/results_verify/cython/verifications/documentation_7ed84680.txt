## Documentation Analysis for strip_py2_long_suffix

### Function Documentation

The function `strip_py2_long_suffix` has minimal documentation - only a docstring:

```python
def strip_py2_long_suffix(value_str):
    """
    Python 2 likes to append 'L' to stringified numbers
    which in then can't process when converting them to numbers.
    """
```

### Key Findings

1. **No formal documentation**: The function is not documented in Cython's public documentation (checked Cython's readthedocs).

2. **No explicit specification for edge cases**: The docstring does not specify:
   - What happens with empty strings
   - What the expected input format is
   - What constitutes valid vs invalid input
   - Whether the function should handle all string inputs gracefully

3. **No unit tests found**: No unit tests were found specifically testing this function.

4. **Not in __all__**: The function is not explicitly exported via __all__, but it is a public function (not prefixed with underscore).

5. **Current usage context**: The function is only called once internally, from `str_to_number()` at line 447, where it processes hex notation strings like "0x1AFL". In this context, the string is guaranteed to be at least 3 characters long.

6. **Purpose from context**: The function's purpose is to strip the 'L' or 'l' suffix that Python 2 used to append to long integer literals (e.g., "123L" -> "123").

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not specify:
- Whether the function is intended for internal use only or public API
- The expected behavior for empty strings
- The expected behavior for strings containing only 'L' or 'l'
- Whether it should validate input or assume valid input

### Conclusion

There is insufficient documentation to definitively say whether handling empty strings is a required behavior or not. The function appears to be a utility function that strips Python 2 long suffixes, and a reasonable expectation would be that it handles all string inputs without crashing, returning the input unchanged if there's nothing to strip.
