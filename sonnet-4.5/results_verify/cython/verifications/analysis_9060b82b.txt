## Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function `_have_importers()` fails to correctly detect PyImportMetaFinder in sys.meta_path
2. The return value structure `(has_py_importer, has_pyx_importer)` clearly indicates independent detection is expected
3. The bug causes `install()` to incorrectly re-install an already-installed PyImportMetaFinder
4. The fix is straightforward and logical - using `elif` instead of nested `if`
5. The classes are siblings (both inherit from MetaPathFinder), not parent-child
6. The current nested isinstance logic is nonsensical given the class hierarchy

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a logic error.

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The bug reproduces exactly as described
2. The analysis of the root cause is correct
3. The proposed fix works correctly

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is internal (prefixed with underscore)
- It might be rarely encountered in practice

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This affects core functionality of pyximport
2. It causes incorrect behavior in the public `install()` function
3. The bug could lead to duplicate importers being installed
4. It's not an obscure edge case - it happens whenever PyImportMetaFinder is installed alone

### FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The function is supposed to detect importers, it just does it incorrectly.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function already exists and has clear intent
2. This is not asking for new functionality
3. The return value structure shows this detection is expected to work

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- There's no documentation specifying the expected behavior
- The function is internal and undocumented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code structure and return values make the intent obvious
2. The function name "_have_importers" (plural) indicates it should detect multiple types
3. The usage in `install()` treats them as independent
4. This is a code bug, not a documentation issue

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The logic error is obvious when examining the class hierarchy and the nested isinstance checks. The function fails to perform its intended purpose of detecting PyImportMetaFinder when it's installed alone, which affects the public `install()` API. The fix is correct and straightforward.
