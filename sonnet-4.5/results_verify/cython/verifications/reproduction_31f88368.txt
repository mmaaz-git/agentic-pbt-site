# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
The bug reported in Cython.Build.Dependencies.parse_list has been successfully reproduced. The function crashes with a KeyError when given a string containing a single unclosed quote character.

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Hypothesis Test
Ran the property-based test provided in the bug report:
- The test immediately found the failing input: a single double-quote character ('"')
- The error matches exactly: KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
- The test failed after only a few examples, confirming the issue is easily triggered

### 2. Minimal Example Test
Directly tested parse_list('"'):
- Result: KeyError: '__Pyx_L1' (exactly as reported)

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
Traced through the code to understand the failure mechanism:

1. When parse_list('"') is called, it calls strip_string_literals('"')
2. strip_string_literals returns: ('"__Pyx_L1_', {'__Pyx_L1_': ''})
   - The stripped string is '"__Pyx_L1_' (note the underscore at the end)
   - The literals dictionary has key '__Pyx_L1_' (with underscore)

3. The unquote function (lines 129-134) then processes '"__Pyx_L1_':
   - It checks if literal[0] is a quote (it is: '"')
   - It tries to lookup literal[1:-1] which is '__Pyx_L1' (no underscore!)
   - The dictionary has '__Pyx_L1_' (with underscore) but not '__Pyx_L1'
   - This causes a KeyError

## Verification
The bug is 100% reproducible and occurs exactly as described in the report. The analysis of the root cause in the bug report is accurate - there's a mismatch between the key generated by strip_string_literals (with trailing underscore) and the key that unquote tries to look up (without trailing underscore).

## Impact
Any input string containing unclosed quotes will crash the function with an unhelpful KeyError, rather than either:
1. Handling the malformed input gracefully
2. Raising a more informative error about malformed quotes
