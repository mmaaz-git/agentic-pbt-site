Bug Reproduction Results for Cython.Build.Cache.load_from_cache
================================================================

1. Bug Report Test Case - REPRODUCED:
   The provided reproduction code demonstrates the issue:
   - Created a zip with 'output.c'
   - Called cache.load_from_cache(c_file, zip_path)
   - Expected file at: /tmp/.../build/output.c
   - Actually created: /tmp/.../build/output.c/output.c
   - The file is incorrectly nested in a subdirectory

2. Hypothesis Test - INITIALLY PASSED (FALSE POSITIVE):
   - The original test used os.path.exists() which returns True for directories
   - At the expected location, a DIRECTORY was created, not a FILE
   - When corrected to use os.path.isfile(), the test FAILS as expected
   - This confirms the bug: files are not extracted to the correct location

3. Root Cause Analysis:
   The current code does:
   ```python
   dirname = os.path.dirname(c_file)
   for artifact in z.namelist():
       z.extract(artifact, join_path(dirname, artifact))
   ```

   With artifact='output.c' and dirname='/tmp/build', this becomes:
   z.extract('output.c', '/tmp/build/output.c')

   Python's zipfile.extract() behavior:
   - extract(member, path) extracts to: path/member
   - So extract('output.c', '/tmp/build/output.c') creates: /tmp/build/output.c/output.c

4. Multi-file Scenario Testing:
   Tested caching multiple files (foo.c, foo.h, foo_api.h):
   - All files end up in wrong locations:
     * Expected: /tmp/build/foo.c
     * Actual: /tmp/build/foo.c/foo.c
     * Expected: /tmp/build/foo.h
     * Actual: /tmp/build/foo.h/foo.h
     * Expected: /tmp/build/foo_api.h
     * Actual: /tmp/build/foo_api.h/foo_api.h

5. Impact on Cython Compilation:
   - After loading from cache, compilation will fail because files are not where expected
   - The cache becomes effectively useless for multi-file outputs
   - This breaks the caching optimization for complex Cython modules

6. Test Suite Verification:
   Cython's own test TestCyCache._test_multi_file_output expects files at:
   - a.c, a.h, a_api.h in the source directory
   - Not in subdirectories
   - This test would fail with the current implementation

The bug is real and reproducible. The fix suggested in the report is correct:
Change z.extract(artifact, join_path(dirname, artifact)) to z.extract(artifact, dirname)
