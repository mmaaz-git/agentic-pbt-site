BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in Cython version 3.1.4.

## Hypothesis Test Reproduction

The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report was executed with the specific failing input (n=0, producing tag name '.0'):
- Result: ValueError: Invalid tag name '.0'
- This confirms the crash described in the report

## Manual Test Cases Reproduction

All three test cases from the bug report were executed and confirmed:

### Case 1: '.0' as regular string
- `is_valid_tag('.0')` returns `True` (should be False)
- `writer.start('.0')` crashes with: "Invalid tag name '.0'"
- Confirms bug: The validation function incorrectly allows '.0' through

### Case 2: Digit-starting tag '0'
- `is_valid_tag('0')` returns `True` (should be False per XML spec)
- `writer.start('0')` crashes with: "Invalid tag name '0'"
- Confirms bug: The validation function incorrectly allows digit-starting tags

### Case 3: Control character '\x1f'
- `is_valid_tag('\x1f')` returns `True` (should be False per XML spec)
- `writer.start('\x1f')` crashes with: "All strings must be XML compatible: Unicode or ASCII, no NULL bytes or control characters"
- Confirms bug: The validation function incorrectly allows control characters

## Code Examination

I examined the actual implementation in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/DebugWriter.py`:

The current `is_valid_tag()` function (lines 16-27):
```python
def is_valid_tag(name):
    """
    Names like '.0' are used internally for arguments
    to functions creating generator expressions,
    however they are not identifiers.

    See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5552
    """
    if isinstance(name, EncodedString):
        if name.startswith(".") and name[1:].isdecimal():
            return False
    return True
```

Key observations:
1. The function only checks for '.N' pattern when `name` is an `EncodedString` instance
2. Regular Python strings with '.N' pattern are not caught
3. No validation for XML tag name rules (no digits at start, no control characters)
4. The function is called in `start()`, `end()`, and `add_entry()` methods as a guard

## Impact

The bug causes crashes in the CythonDebugWriter when invalid XML tag names are used. These invalid names pass through the `is_valid_tag()` validation but then fail when lxml's TreeBuilder attempts to create XML elements with them. This affects Cython's debug info generation functionality.

## Conclusion

The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The `is_valid_tag()` function does not properly validate XML tag names according to XML specifications, leading to crashes in downstream lxml operations.
