## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for Each Category:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function produces invalid output for negative scientific notation that cannot be parsed back to float
- The function produces incorrect numerical values for some inputs (e.g., 1.67660926681519e-08 becomes 16766092.000000067)
- Simple negative numbers like "-123.456" work correctly, suggesting negative support was intended
- The function is used in compiler code (ExprNodes.py) where it would need to handle all valid float values
- The test suite explicitly requires round-trip parseability (float(result) == float(original))
- The function's purpose (normalizing floats for comparison) logically requires handling all float values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state negative numbers should be supported
- All test cases only use positive numbers, possibly intentionally

#### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation never explicitly states negative numbers are supported
- All provided examples are positive numbers
- Test suite only tests positive numbers, suggesting design intent

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Simple negative numbers DO work ("-123.456" â†’ "-123.456")
- Function is used in compiler code that would encounter negative floats
- A float normalization function that doesn't handle negative numbers would be fundamentally broken
- The bug causes actual crashes (ValueError) and wrong values, not just edge cases

#### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be considered an obscure edge case (negative scientific notation)
- Internal utility function not part of public API

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Not obscure - negative numbers and scientific notation are common
- Produces completely wrong values or unparseable output
- Used in compiler code where correctness matters
- Simple fix is available

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that negative number support is a new feature since tests don't cover it

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Basic negative numbers already work
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- Function purpose (float normalization) inherently requires all float support

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation could be updated to explicitly state "positive numbers only"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is clearly broken, not just the documentation
- Produces invalid/unparseable output and wrong numerical values
- Simple negative numbers work, showing intent to support them

### Analysis Summary:

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Functionality is broken**: The function produces output that either cannot be parsed as a float or represents a completely different numerical value

2. **Partial negative support exists**: Simple negative numbers like "-123.456" work correctly, demonstrating that negative support was intended but incompletely implemented

3. **Context requires full float support**: The function is used in compiler code (ExprNodes.py) for handling float constants, which would naturally include negative values

4. **Test contract violation**: The existing tests verify that float(result) == float(original), which this bug violates

5. **Not an edge case**: Negative numbers and scientific notation are common in numerical computing, not obscure edge cases

6. **Clear logic error**: The code has an obvious bug where it doesn't separate the minus sign before processing, causing it to end up in the wrong position

The fact that the test suite doesn't include negative numbers appears to be a testing oversight rather than intentional design limitation.
