## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering Each Category:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments for:**
- The function crashes with ValueError on malformed input instead of handling it gracefully
- This is a testing utility that should be robust to various inputs
- The crash happens on reasonable user inputs (typos, incomplete patterns)
- The proposed fix is reasonable and maintains backward compatibility
- Other parts of Cython's testing framework handle errors more gracefully

**Arguments against:**
- The function is internal (underscore prefix) and not part of public API
- No documentation promises specific error handling
- The existing tests only cover valid patterns

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- The function is private/internal (underscore prefix)
- No documentation exists specifying how malformed patterns should be handled
- Users shouldn't be calling internal functions directly
- The patterns `/start` without closing `/` are malformed and invalid

**Arguments against:**
- Even internal functions shouldn't crash on predictable inputs
- The function is imported and used in tests
- A ValueError with unhelpful message is poor UX even for internal functions

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- This is an internal function not meant for public use
- The error only occurs with malformed patterns that shouldn't exist
- Existing code presumably uses correct patterns
- The cost of fixing may not be worth it for an internal function

**Arguments against:**
- The fix is trivial and improves robustness
- Testing utilities should be particularly robust
- The error message is confusing and doesn't indicate what's wrong

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Adding graceful error handling could be seen as a new feature
- The function currently works as coded for valid inputs
- Error handling for malformed patterns wasn't originally specified

**Arguments against:**
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The function already has a clear purpose that it fails to fulfill robustly

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- Could document that patterns must have matching delimiters
- Could add examples of invalid patterns to avoid

**Arguments against:**
- The issue is the code crashing, not unclear documentation
- Internal functions often lack documentation
- Documentation won't prevent the crash

### Final Assessment:

This is most appropriately categorized as **WONTFIX** or **BUG**.

The key factors:
1. It's an internal function (underscore prefix)
2. It crashes on malformed input that shouldn't occur in practice
3. The fix is trivial but the function is internal
4. No public API contract is violated

Given that this is an internal testing utility that crashes on malformed patterns (which shouldn't exist in proper test code), and considering the underscore prefix indicating it's private, this would typically be categorized as **WONTFIX** - an obscure edge case in internal code that wouldn't affect normal usage.

However, since testing utilities should be robust and the fix is trivial, there's also a case for **BUG**.
