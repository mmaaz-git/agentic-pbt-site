TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be BUG:**
✓ The implementation clearly contradicts the documented behavior
✓ The documentation explicitly states "Use py:arg=value to set a Python value"
✓ The current code uses name[:3] (keeping "py:") instead of name[3:] (removing "py:")
✓ This is an obvious array slicing error - a classic off-by-one type mistake
✓ The feature is completely broken - all py: variables overwrite each other
✓ The fix is trivial and obvious (change [:3] to [3:])
✓ This breaks a documented feature that users would reasonably expect to work

**Verdict: STRONG CASE FOR BUG**

## INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Why it might be INVALID:**
✗ The code does exactly what the report says (confirmed by testing)
✗ The documentation clearly supports the report's interpretation
✗ No evidence of misunderstanding or incorrect assumptions

**Verdict: NOT INVALID**

## WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
✗ This is not an obscure edge case - it's the primary use case for py: prefix
✗ The bug completely breaks a documented feature
✗ Users would reasonably encounter this in normal usage
✗ The fix is not complex or risky

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX**

## FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
✗ The functionality is already documented and intended to exist
✗ This isn't asking for new behavior, but fixing broken existing behavior
✗ The documentation explicitly describes how this should work

**Verdict: NOT A FEATURE REQUEST**

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Doc Error)
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
✗ The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
✗ The code is wrong, not the documentation
✗ The docstring at lines 1032-1033 clearly states the correct usage
✗ Changing docs to match broken code would make the feature useless

**Verdict: NOT A DOCUMENTATION FIX**

## FINAL ASSESSMENT
This is unquestionably a **BUG**. The implementation contains a clear logic error (using [:3] instead of [3:]) that completely breaks the documented py: prefix feature. The bug makes it impossible to use Python-evaluated variables from the command line as intended. The fix is trivial and correct.
