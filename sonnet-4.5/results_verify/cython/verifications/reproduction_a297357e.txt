## Bug Reproduction Report

### Environment Setup
The bug was reproduced using Python 3.13 with Cython installed via miniconda.

### Direct Reproduction
I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report:

1. **With double quote:**
   ```python
   from Cython.Build.Dependencies import parse_list
   parse_list('"')
   ```
   Result: `KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'`

2. **With single quote:**
   ```python
   from Cython.Build.Dependencies import parse_list
   parse_list("'")
   ```
   Result: `KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'`

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The provided Hypothesis test was run and failed as expected:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings
from Cython.Build.Dependencies import parse_list

@given(st.text())
@settings(max_examples=1000)
def test_parse_list_returns_list(s):
    result = parse_list(s)
    assert isinstance(result, list)
```

The test quickly found a failing example with `s="'"` and raised the same `KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'`.

### Root Cause Analysis
Through code inspection, I confirmed the root cause described in the bug report:

1. `strip_string_literals()` creates placeholder labels with trailing underscores (e.g., `__Pyx_L1_`)
2. When encountering an unclosed quote, it returns something like `'__Pyx_L1_` (the quote followed by the label)
3. The `unquote()` function in `parse_list()` tries to extract the label using `literal[1:-1]`
4. This strips both the closing quote (which doesn't exist) AND the trailing underscore
5. It then tries to look up `__Pyx_L1` instead of `__Pyx_L1_`, causing the KeyError

The bug is reproducible and the root cause analysis in the report is accurate.
