## Documentation Analysis for FastMachine.chars_to_ranges

### Source Code Location
The function is located at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Plex/Machines.py`, lines 212-228.

### Documentation Found
**No formal documentation was found for this method.** The method has:
- No docstring
- No comments explaining its purpose
- No specification of expected behavior with duplicate characters

### Inferred Purpose from Code Context
Based on the code analysis:

1. **Usage Context**: The method is called by `dump_transitions` (line 201) as part of the debugging output functionality for state machines.

2. **Input**: Takes a list of characters (char_list)

3. **Process**:
   - Sorts the character list
   - Groups consecutive characters into ranges
   - Each range is represented as a tuple (start_char, end_char)

4. **Output**: Returns a tuple of range pairs

5. **Example Usage**: Used to create compact string representations of character transitions for debugging output, e.g., converting ['a', 'b', 'c'] to [('a', 'c')] which displays as 'a'..'c'

### Key Observations
1. **No specification for duplicates**: The documentation does not specify how duplicate characters should be handled.

2. **Debugging purpose**: The function appears to be primarily used for creating human-readable debugging output, not for core functionality.

3. **Internal utility**: This is an internal utility method of the FastMachine class, not part of the public API.

4. **Implicit expectations**: The code seems to assume a sorted list of unique characters based on its algorithm, but this is not explicitly stated or enforced.

### Conclusion
Without explicit documentation, the behavior with duplicate characters is **undefined**. The function's name suggests it should convert characters to ranges, but there's no specification about:
- Whether input should be unique
- How duplicates should be handled
- What the "correct" output should be for duplicate inputs

This lack of specification is critical for determining whether the reported behavior is a bug or simply undefined behavior.
