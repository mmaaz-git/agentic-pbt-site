## Documentation Analysis for cap_length Function

### Documentation Search Results
After extensive searching, I found:

1. **No public API documentation**: The `cap_length` function is not documented in the official Cython documentation. It does not appear in any public API references or user guides.

2. **No docstring**: The function implementation has no docstring or inline comments explaining its purpose or contract.

3. **Internal utility function**: The function appears to be an internal utility within Cython.Compiler.PyrexTypes, used only internally within the Cython compiler.

### Function Context and Usage
By examining the source code, I found that `cap_length` is used in several places within PyrexTypes.py:

1. Line 3521: `arg_names = cap_length("_".join(arg_names))`
2. Line 5655: `return cap_length('__and_'.join(type_identifier(type) for type in types))`
3. Line 5700: `safe = cap_length(re.sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9_]', lambda x: '__%X' % ord(x.group(0)), safe))`

All usage appears to be for creating type identifiers and mangled names that need to be limited in length, likely for C compiler compatibility (the default max_len=63 suggests adherence to C identifier length limits).

### Implicit Contract
Based on the function name and parameter:
- **Function name**: `cap_length` strongly implies it should cap/limit the length of strings
- **Parameter name**: `max_len` explicitly indicates a maximum length constraint
- **Default value**: 63 is a common limit for C identifiers in many compilers

### Documentation Verdict
The function has no formal documentation specifying its behavior. However:
1. The function name and parameter names form an implicit contract that the result should not exceed `max_len`
2. The function is used internally where length constraints are important for C compiler compatibility
3. The bug violates the obvious semantic meaning of both the function name and parameter name

### Conclusion
While there is no formal documentation, the function's name `cap_length` with parameter `max_len` creates a clear implicit contract that the function should ensure the returned string does not exceed `max_len` characters. The current behavior for `max_len < 17` violates this obvious semantic contract.
