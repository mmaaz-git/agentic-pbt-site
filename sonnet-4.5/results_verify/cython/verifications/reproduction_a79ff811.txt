## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is confirmed to exist.

### Test Results:

1. **Simple Example Reproduction:**
   - Input: `['test.txt', '/tmp/tmpaw4tu5jm/test.txt']`
   - Output: `['/tmp/tmpaw4tu5jm/test.txt', '/tmp/tmpaw4tu5jm/test.txt']`
   - The function returns duplicate paths when given a relative path and the corresponding absolute path

2. **Property-Based Test:**
   - The test failed with input `filename='0'`
   - The function returned `['/tmp/tmp3fh_m0u1/0', '/tmp/tmp3fh_m0u1/0']` from `['0', '/tmp/tmp3fh_m0u1/0']`
   - This confirms the duplicate path issue

### Code Analysis:

The function `normalize_existing` (line 409-410) calls `normalize_existing0` after applying `set(rel_paths)` to remove exact string duplicates.

The `normalize_existing0` function (lines 414-438) processes each path:
- For absolute paths, it keeps them as-is (line 430)
- For relative paths, it joins them with the base directory and normalizes them (lines 432-434)

The issue occurs because:
1. `set(rel_paths)` only removes exact string duplicates
2. When processing `['test.txt', '/tmp/xxx/test.txt']`:
   - 'test.txt' (relative) gets converted to '/tmp/xxx/test.txt'
   - '/tmp/xxx/test.txt' (absolute) stays as '/tmp/xxx/test.txt'
3. Both end up as the same normalized path in the output

The bug is real and causes the function to return duplicate normalized paths when given different representations of the same file.
