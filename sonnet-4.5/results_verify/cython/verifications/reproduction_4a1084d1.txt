REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The function `pandas.core.indexers.length_of_indexer` indeed returns negative values for slices with negative steps, which is incorrect.

TEST RESULTS:

1. Hypothesis Test:
   - The provided property-based test immediately found a failure case
   - Failed on: n=1, slice(None, -2, None) where length_of_indexer returned -1 but actual length was 0

2. Manual Test Cases (all from the bug report):
   - Array [0], slice(None, None, -1):
     * length_of_indexer returned: -1
     * Actual length: 1
     * MISMATCH (negative value returned)

   - Array [0,1,2,3,4], slice(None, None, -1):
     * length_of_indexer returned: -5
     * Actual length: 5
     * MISMATCH (negative value returned)

   - Array [0..9], slice(None, None, -2):
     * length_of_indexer returned: -5
     * Actual length: 5
     * MISMATCH (negative value returned)

   - Array [0..9], slice(5, None, -1):
     * length_of_indexer returned: -5
     * Actual length: 6
     * MISMATCH (wrong negative value returned)

SEMANTIC VERIFICATION:

I verified that in Python and NumPy:
- The len() function ALWAYS returns non-negative integers
- For slices with negative steps, len() correctly returns positive values
- Example: len(np.arange(5)[::âˆ’1]) = 5 (not -5)

EFFECT:

The bug causes `length_of_indexer` to return negative values when given slices with negative steps, which violates the fundamental semantic expectation that lengths are non-negative. This makes the function unusable for its intended purpose when dealing with negative-step slices.
