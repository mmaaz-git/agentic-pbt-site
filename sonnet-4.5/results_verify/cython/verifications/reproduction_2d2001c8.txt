REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported for Cython.Utility.pylong_join and Cython.Utility._pylong_join.

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Imported both functions from Cython.Utility module
2. Called both functions with count=0
3. Compared the results

CONFIRMED BEHAVIOR:
- pylong_join(0) returns an empty string: ''
- _pylong_join(0) returns empty parentheses: '()'
- These values are NOT equal, confirming the inconsistency

HYPOTHESIS TEST:
The provided Hypothesis test fails immediately on count=0, confirming that the two implementations produce different outputs for this edge case.

EXTENDED TESTING:
I tested additional values (count=1,2,3,4) and found that ALL values produce different outputs between the two functions. However, this is expected as they use different algorithms:
- pylong_join uses nested shifts: (((d[2] << n) | d[1]) << n) | d[0]
- _pylong_join uses independent shifts: (d[2] << 2*n) | (d[1] << 1*n) | d[0]

The key issue is that both functions are code generators that produce C code expressions. For count=0:
- An empty string '' would be INVALID C code (an empty expression)
- The string '()' is valid C code (an empty parenthesized expression)

IMPACT:
If pylong_join(0) is used to generate C code, it would produce invalid/empty C code that could cause compilation errors. The _pylong_join(0) produces valid (albeit unusual) C code.

The bug report accurately describes the issue and provides correct reproduction code.
