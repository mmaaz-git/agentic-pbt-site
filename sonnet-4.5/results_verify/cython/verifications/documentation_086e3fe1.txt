DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Function Signature:
   The function is defined as: def safe_type(arg, context=None)
   - The context parameter explicitly defaults to None
   - This indicates that calling safe_type without a context should be a valid use case

2. Public API Status:
   - safe_type is exposed in the public API of Cython.Build.Inline module
   - It appears in dir(Cython.Build.Inline) output
   - There is no underscore prefix suggesting it's internal
   - The function can be imported directly: from Cython.Build.Inline import safe_type

3. Documentation Found:
   - No docstring exists for the function (confirmed by checking safe_type.__doc__)
   - No specific documentation found in the official Cython documentation
   - The help() function only shows the signature with context=None as default

4. Usage Context:
   - The function is used internally by cython_inline() through unsafe_type()
   - In cython_inline, a Context object is always created or a default one is used
   - However, being a public function with context=None as default, it should handle None gracefully

5. Expected Behavior (inferred from code):
   The function's purpose is to determine a safe Cython type for Python objects:
   - For built-in types, it returns specific Cython type strings
   - For custom types, it should either:
     a) Find the type in a Cython module (when context is provided)
     b) Fall back to 'object' (when no match is found or context is None)

6. Documentation Implications:
   - The function signature explicitly allows context=None
   - There's no documentation stating that context is required
   - The default parameter suggests the function should work without a context
   - Other built-in types work correctly with context=None, establishing precedent

Conclusion: The documentation (via the function signature) clearly indicates that context=None should be supported. The function fails to honor its own API contract when dealing with custom classes.
