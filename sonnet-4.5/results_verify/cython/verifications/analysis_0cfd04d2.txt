## Triage Analysis for normalise_float_repr Bug Report

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function produces invalid float strings that cannot be parsed (e.g., `.00000000-1`)
- The function corrupts numeric values by orders of magnitude (10^16 times off)
- The existing test suite explicitly checks `float(result) == float(input)`
- The function is used in a compiler context where correctness is critical
- The bug is easily reproducible with simple test cases
- The fix is straightforward and addresses a clear logic error

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None - this is clearly a bug

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly mention negative number support

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- A function that "normalises" floats should handle all valid floats
- The test suite shows the expectation of value preservation
- Producing invalid float strings is clearly incorrect behavior
- Python floats include negative numbers as a fundamental type

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Negative scientific notation might be considered an edge case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - negative numbers are common
- The function produces completely invalid output (unparseable strings)
- Scientific notation is explicitly tested in the test suite
- The corruption can be extreme (10^16 times value change)

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be clearer about negative number handling

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is clearly broken, not just poorly documented
- Invalid float strings are not a documentation issue
- The test suite shows the intended behavior (value preservation)

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Negative number support could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Floats inherently include negative numbers
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function name implies it should handle all float representations

### Critical Observations

1. **Severity**: This produces completely invalid output that causes exceptions
2. **Impact**: Used in Cython compiler for float value processing
3. **Root Cause**: Clear logic error in handling the minus sign
4. **Test Gap**: No negative number tests in the existing test suite
5. **Fix Availability**: The bug report provides a working fix

### Decision Rationale

This is unequivocally a **BUG** because:

1. **Invalid Output**: The function produces strings that cannot be parsed as floats, causing ValueError exceptions. This is objectively incorrect behavior.

2. **Value Corruption**: Even when parseable, values can be corrupted by factors of 10^16, which is catastrophic for a normalization function.

3. **Test Contract Violation**: The existing test suite explicitly verifies `float(result) == float(input)`, establishing the contract that values must be preserved.

4. **Fundamental Type Support**: Negative numbers are not an edge case or special feature - they are a fundamental part of the float type.

5. **Compiler Context**: This function is used in the Cython compiler where correctness is paramount.

6. **Clear Logic Error**: The bug stems from treating the minus sign as part of the digit string when calculating positions, which is an obvious implementation error.

The fact that the existing test suite lacks negative number tests explains why this bug went undetected, but doesn't diminish that it's a bug. A normalization function that fails on negative numbers is fundamentally broken.
