## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Strong Arguments For:**
1. **Core Functionality Broken**: The parse_signature function fails to parse any function signature correctly by dropping the last argument. This breaks a documented feature.
2. **Clear Expected Behavior**: Function signatures should parse all arguments, not drop the last one. This is basic functionality.
3. **Impact is Significant**: Makes template functions with arguments unusable unless all have defaults.
4. **Reproducible**: 100% reproducible with simple test cases.
5. **Root Cause Identified**: The tokenizer handling misses NEWLINE tokens, a clear implementation error.
6. **Documentation Supports**: The {{def}} syntax with arguments is explicitly documented as a supported feature.
7. **Not Edge Case**: This affects ALL function signatures, not some obscure corner case.
8. **Fix is Clear**: Adding tokenize.NEWLINE to the condition is a straightforward fix.

**Arguments Against:**
- None. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- None. The bug is real, reproducible, and breaks documented functionality.

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is verified and reproduces consistently.
- The documentation explicitly shows this feature should work.
- The code clearly has a logic error in tokenizer handling.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- None. This is not an obscure edge case.

**Arguments Against:**
- This breaks core functionality, not some trivial edge case.
- The feature (template functions with arguments) is explicitly documented.
- The impact is severe - makes an entire feature unusable.
- The fix is simple and clear.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- None. The feature already exists and is documented.

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not asking for new functionality.
- The {{def}} syntax with arguments is already documented and should work.
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding something new.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- None. The documentation is correct; the implementation is wrong.

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation accurately describes how the feature should work.
- The code fails to implement what the documentation promises.
- Changing documentation to say "functions can't have arguments" would remove a core feature.

## Final Analysis

This is unquestionably a **BUG**. The evidence is overwhelming:

1. **Severity**: High - breaks core template functionality
2. **Scope**: Affects all function signatures universally
3. **Documentation**: Feature is explicitly documented to work
4. **Implementation Error**: Clear tokenizer handling bug
5. **User Impact**: Makes template functions unusable
6. **Fix Availability**: Simple, clear fix identified

The parse_signature function has a clear implementation error where it fails to handle NEWLINE tokens that appear before ENDMARKER in Python's tokenizer output. This causes it to drop the last argument of every function signature, breaking the documented {{def}} functionality in Tempita templates.

This is a textbook example of a valid bug report that should be fixed.
