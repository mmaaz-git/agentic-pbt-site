DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After thorough research of available documentation, I found the following:

1. NO EXPLICIT DOCUMENTATION FOR get_extension_attr
--------------------------------------------------
- The `get_extension_attr` method itself has no documentation, comments, or docstrings
- There's no official documentation explaining how this method should behave
- The implementation is a single line with no explanatory comments

2. IMPLICIT BEHAVIOR FROM CODE STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------
From the code context (lines 86-129 in build_ext.py), the method is used to retrieve options that can come from either:
- Command-line options (stored as attributes on the build_ext instance)
- Extension-specific options (stored as attributes on Extension objects)

The usage pattern shows it's called like:
- `self.get_extension_attr(ext, 'cython_cplus')`
- `self.get_extension_attr(ext, 'cython_compile_time_env', default=None)`

3. ESTABLISHED PRECEDENCE PRINCIPLES IN PYTHON BUILD SYSTEMS
------------------------------------------------------------
From distutils/setuptools documentation:
- Command-line options traditionally override configuration file settings
- Later options override earlier options (e.g., in gcc compiler flags)
- The general principle is that more specific/local settings override more general ones

From Cython documentation on directives:
- Local directives take precedence over file-level directives
- Command-line `-X` options override header comments
- More specific settings override less specific ones

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR BASED ON STANDARD PRACTICES
------------------------------------------------
Based on established patterns in Python build tools:
- Command-line options (self attributes) SHOULD take precedence over extension attributes
- This is consistent with how other build systems work (Make, CMake, etc.)
- Users expect command-line flags to override defaults/configuration

5. THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION'S PROBLEM
----------------------------------------
The use of `or` operator is problematic because:
- It conflates "not set" with "set to a falsy value"
- This violates the expected precedence order
- A user explicitly setting `cython_cplus=0` expects it to override an extension's `cython_cplus=1`

6. DOCUMENTATION VERDICT
------------------------
While there's no explicit documentation stating how `get_extension_attr` should handle falsy values, the behavior violates:
1. Common conventions in build systems where command-line overrides configuration
2. The principle of least surprise - users expect explicit settings to be honored
3. The pattern established elsewhere in Python build tools

The lack of explicit documentation about this specific behavior does NOT invalidate the bug because:
- The current behavior is counterintuitive and breaks expected precedence rules
- Users have reasonable expectations based on how other similar tools work
- The inability to set falsy values via command-line is a functional limitation
