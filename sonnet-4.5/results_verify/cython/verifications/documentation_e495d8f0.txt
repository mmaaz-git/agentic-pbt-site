# Documentation Analysis

## CyBreak Class Documentation
The CyBreak class has docstring documentation that describes its purpose:
```
Set a breakpoint for Cython code using Cython qualified name notation, e.g.:

    cy break cython_modulename.ClassName.method_name...

or normal notation:

    cy break function_or_method_name...

or for a line number:

    cy break cython_module:lineno...
```

## Complete Method Documentation
There is NO specific documentation for the `complete` method itself. The method relies on:
1. A comment with a link to GDB source code
2. Inline comments explaining some logic ("complete unqualified", "complete qualified name")

## GDB Python API Documentation
From the official GDB documentation:
- The `complete(text, word)` method is called for TAB completion
- `text`: Contains the complete command line up to the cursor's location
- `word`: Contains the last word of the command line (using word-breaking heuristic)
- The method should return a sequence of completion strings

## Expected Behavior (Inferred)
The intent of the code at line 957 is clear from the variable name and logic:
- `seen`: Should contain function names already typed in the command line
- Purpose: Avoid suggesting names that are already present in the command
- The code attempts to remove `word` from the end of `text` to get what was typed before

## Documentation Gap
The documentation does NOT specify:
1. How the complete method should handle empty `word` parameters
2. What should happen when completing at word boundaries
3. The exact filtering behavior for already-typed function names

## Conclusion
The bug report's assumption is reasonable:
- The variable name `seen` clearly indicates intention to track already-seen names
- The logic `n not in seen` clearly intends to filter out duplicates
- A completion system that suggests already-typed names is counterintuitive
- No documentation suggests that duplicate suggestions are intended behavior

The behavior described in the bug report (filtering out already-typed names) aligns with:
1. The apparent intent of the code (based on variable names and logic)
2. Standard UX expectations for command completion systems
3. The general principle that completions should suggest new options, not repeat existing ones
