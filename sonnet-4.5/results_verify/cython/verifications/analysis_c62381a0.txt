TRIAGE ANALYSIS

## Consideration for Each Category:

### BUG - Arguments FOR:
- Clear inconsistency between attribute name ('kw_only') and repr display ('kwonly')
- The attribute is consistently named 'kw_only' everywhere else in the code
- This is a fallback implementation meant to match Python's standard dataclasses
- Python's standard dataclasses.Field uses 'kw_only' (with underscore)
- The repr's purpose is to aid debugging by showing the actual object state
- The inconsistency could cause confusion when debugging
- The fix is trivial and correct (change 'kwonly' to 'kw_only' in line 66)

### INVALID - Arguments AGAINST:
- The code still functions correctly despite the repr inconsistency
- Users can still access the attribute via f.kw_only
- This is only a display issue, not a functional bug
- However, repr accuracy is generally expected in Python

### WONTFIX - Arguments FOR:
- This is a minor cosmetic issue in the repr output
- It doesn't affect functionality at all
- The fallback implementation is only used when stdlib isn't available
- Could be considered too trivial to fix

### WONTFIX - Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects all Field objects
- The fix is trivial and improves consistency
- Repr accuracy is important for debugging

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments FOR:
- Could document that the repr uses 'kwonly' for historical reasons

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments AGAINST:
- This is clearly a typo/mistake, not intended behavior
- No documentation suggests this inconsistency is intentional
- Documenting a typo rather than fixing it would be odd

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments FOR:
- Could frame as "improve repr consistency"

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments AGAINST:
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The repr should already show correct attribute names

## Conclusion:

This is a **BUG**. The reasons are compelling:

1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The repr claims to show the object's state but uses the wrong attribute name
2. **Consistency Issue**: Every other part of the code uses 'kw_only' with underscore
3. **Compatibility Issue**: This fallback should match Python's standard dataclasses which uses 'kw_only'
4. **Debugging Impact**: Incorrect repr can mislead developers during debugging
5. **Simple Fix**: The fix is trivial and clearly correct
6. **Not Edge Case**: Affects all Field objects with kw_only attribute

While the severity is low (it's just a repr display issue), it's still a legitimate bug that should be fixed for consistency and correctness.
