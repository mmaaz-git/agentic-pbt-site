DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Function Documentation

The function chars_to_ranges has the following documentation in the source code (lines 29-33):
```python
"""
Return a list of character codes consisting of pairs
[code1a, code1b, code2a, code2b,...] which cover all
the characters in |s|.
"""
```

The Any() function documentation (lines 433-435):
```python
"""
Any(s) is an RE which matches any character in the string |s|.
"""
```

## Documentation Interpretation

1. **chars_to_ranges**: The documentation clearly states it should return ranges that "cover all the characters in |s|". This means:
   - Input 'aa' has only one unique character: 'a'
   - The output should cover only 'a', not 'a' and 'b'
   - The current behavior violates this documented contract

2. **Any()**: The documentation states it matches "any character in the string |s|". This means:
   - Any('aa') should match only the character 'a' (which appears in the string)
   - It should NOT match 'b' which does not appear in the string
   - Due to the bug in chars_to_ranges, Any('aa') incorrectly matches 'b'

## External Documentation

Attempts to find external documentation:
- Checked GitHub repository: No specific Plex documentation found
- Checked official Cython docs: No detailed Plex module documentation found
- The Plex module appears to be an internal lexical analysis tool

## Conclusion

The documentation clearly establishes that:
1. chars_to_ranges should return ranges covering exactly the characters present in the input
2. Any(s) should match only characters that appear in string s
3. The current behavior violates both documented behaviors
4. This is a legitimate bug, not undefined or undocumented behavior
