## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong evidence:**
- The function violates its documented contract by returning ranges that include characters not present in the input
- The bug is reproducible with a simple test case ('00')
- It affects public APIs (`Any()` and `AnyBut()`) that users depend on
- The root cause is clearly identified (incorrect comparison operator)
- The fix is simple and correct
- This could cause real issues in lexical analyzers where precise character matching is critical

**Why it IS a bug:**
- Clear violation of documented behavior
- Affects correctness of pattern matching
- Not an edge case - duplicates in character sets are common (e.g., regex patterns like "[aaa]" should match only 'a')

### Consideration for INVALID
**Possible arguments:**
- None. The documentation is clear and the behavior is incorrect.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Possible arguments:**
- Could argue that users shouldn't pass duplicate characters to these functions
- Might claim it's been this way for a long time and changing it could break existing code

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The bug causes incorrect behavior that violates the specification
- Duplicate characters in input strings are valid and should be handled correctly
- The current behavior is objectively wrong and could cause security/correctness issues

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Possible arguments:**
- Could claim that handling duplicates is a new feature

**Why it's NOT a feature request:**
- The documentation already specifies what should happen
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capabilities

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Possible arguments:**
- Could update documentation to say duplicates aren't supported
- Could document the current buggy behavior as intentional

**Why it's NOT a documentation fix:**
- The current documentation makes sense and is correct
- The code should be fixed to match the documentation, not vice versa
- Changing docs to match buggy behavior would make the API worse

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function fails to meet its documented specification when given valid input (a string with duplicate characters). The bug has a clear root cause, affects public APIs, and has a straightforward fix. There's no reasonable interpretation where this behavior is correct or acceptable.
