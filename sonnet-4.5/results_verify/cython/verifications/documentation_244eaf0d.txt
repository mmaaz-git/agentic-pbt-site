## Documentation Analysis for not_nulls Function

### Function Location and Definition
The `not_nulls` function is defined at line 915 in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/llm_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py`:

```python
def not_nulls(data) -> dict:
    return {key: value for key, value in data if value is not None}
```

### Function Usage
The function is called exactly once in the codebase, at line 658 within the `build_kwargs` method:
```python
kwargs = dict(not_nulls(prompt.options))
```

### Documentation Findings
1. **No explicit documentation**: There is no docstring or comment for the `not_nulls` function itself.

2. **No external documentation**: Searching the LLM project's GitHub repository and documentation did not yield any specific documentation about this function.

3. **No test coverage found**: No unit tests or integration tests were found specifically testing the `not_nulls` function.

4. **Type annotation**: The function has a return type annotation of `-> dict`, indicating it should return a dictionary.

5. **Context of usage**: The function is used to process `prompt.options`, which based on the context appears to be a dictionary-like object containing configuration options for OpenAI API calls. The processed result is then passed to `dict()` constructor.

### Implicit Expected Behavior
Based on the function name and its usage context:
- The function appears intended to filter out None values from a data structure
- It's expected to return a dictionary with all key-value pairs where the value is not None
- The input (`prompt.options`) is expected to be some form of iterable that yields key-value pairs

### Documentation Gap
There is no explicit documentation specifying:
- What type of input the function expects (dictionary, list of tuples, or other iterable)
- What happens with invalid input types
- Whether the function should handle nested structures
- Error handling expectations

The lack of documentation makes it unclear whether the current implementation is correct as-is (expecting an iterable of (key, value) tuples) or incorrect (expecting a dictionary and missing `.items()` call).
