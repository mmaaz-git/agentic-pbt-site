=== Documentation Analysis ===

## Function Purpose
The `split_string_literal` function in Cython.Compiler.StringEncoding is designed to work around MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) compiler limitations on string literal length.

## MSVC String Literal Constraints
Based on web searches and Microsoft documentation:
1. **Individual String Literal Limit**: MSVC has a limit of approximately 2048 bytes for a single string literal
2. **Concatenated String Limit**: Multiple string literals can be concatenated to reach up to 65535 bytes total
3. **Compiler Error**: When exceeding limits, MSVC reports "error C2026: string too big, trailing characters truncated"

## Function Implementation
The function:
- Takes a string `s` and a `limit` parameter (default 2000)
- If the string length is less than the limit, returns it unchanged
- Otherwise, splits the string into chunks of size `limit`
- Joins chunks with `""` to create concatenated string literals that MSVC can handle

## Special Handling for Backslashes
The function includes special logic (lines 312-319) to avoid splitting within escape sequences:
- Checks if there's a backslash in the last 4 characters before a split point
- Adjusts the split point to avoid breaking escape sequences
- Handles long sequences of backslashes with a fallback calculation

## Documentation Findings

### Explicit Documentation
- The function has minimal inline documentation: only "# MSVC can't handle long string literals."
- No external documentation found in Cython's official docs about this specific function
- No documentation specifying valid ranges for the `limit` parameter
- No documentation about expected behavior with very small limits

### Implicit Expectations
- Default limit of 2000 is clearly chosen to stay under MSVC's ~2048 byte limit
- The function is clearly internal utility code for C code generation
- The backslash handling suggests it's meant to work with C string literals containing escape sequences

### Unspecified Behavior
The documentation does NOT specify:
1. What happens with `limit` values less than 6
2. Whether negative or zero `limit` values are valid
3. The exact algorithm for handling consecutive backslashes
4. Whether the function should handle edge cases like `limit=1` or `limit=2`
5. The expected behavior when the fallback calculation `start + limit - (limit % 2) - 4` results in non-positive values

## Conclusion
The function is an internal utility for MSVC compatibility with a default limit that makes sense (2000 < 2048). However, there is NO documentation specifying that the function must work correctly for arbitrarily small `limit` values. The bug occurs with `limit < 6`, which is far below any reasonable use case for MSVC string literal splitting (MSVC's actual limit is ~2048 bytes).
