DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
The Cython documentation (https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html) specifies that distutils directives can be included in source files using special comments:

- Format: # distutils: key = value
- Examples given:
  # distutils: libraries = spam eggs
  # distutils: include_dirs = /opt/food/include
  # distutils: sources = [helper.c, another_helper.c]

The documentation does NOT explicitly state:
- How inline comments after directives should be handled
- Whether inline comments are allowed or disallowed
- What the expected behavior is when # appears within directive values

2. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
The parse_list function has docstring tests showing expected behavior:
- parse_list("") → []
- parse_list("a b c") → ['a', 'b', 'c']
- parse_list("[a, b, c]") → ['a', 'b', 'c']
- parse_list('a " " b') → ['a', ' ', 'b']

The docstring does NOT show:
- Any test cases with # characters
- Any test cases with inline comments
- Expected behavior when # appears in input

3. PYTHON COMMENT CONVENTIONS:
Standard Python convention is that # starts a comment that extends to end of line. This is universally expected behavior in Python code, and users would reasonably expect this to apply to distutils directive lines as well.

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
The strip_string_literals function is designed to normalize string literals in code. It explicitly treats # as a comment marker and replaces comment text with placeholder labels like __Pyx_L1_. This function was designed for processing Cython/Python source code, not for parsing configuration values.

5. LACK OF SPECIFICATION:
The documentation does not specify:
- Whether parse_list is intended to handle comments at all
- Whether strip_string_literals should be used for parsing directive values
- The intended scope of strip_string_literals (code parsing vs config parsing)

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is incomplete regarding comment handling in distutils directives. While the implementation treats # as starting a comment (consistent with Python), it incorrectly includes placeholder labels in the parsed results rather than stripping the comments entirely.
