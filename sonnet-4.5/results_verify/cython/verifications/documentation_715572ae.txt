## Documentation Analysis

### Function Purpose
The `restore_Options` function is an internal test utility function in the Cython compiler's test suite. Based on code analysis:

1. **Location**: `Cython.Compiler.Tests.Utils`
2. **Purpose**: To restore the Options module to a previously backed-up state after tests have modified it
3. **Used in**: Test setup/teardown (e.g., in `TestCmdLine.py` where it's used in `tearDown()` methods)

### Documentation Status
- **No public documentation found**: The function is not documented in the public Cython documentation
- **Internal utility**: This is an internal test utility, not part of the public API
- **Self-documenting code**: The function has a clear comment explaining its intent: "strip Options from new keys that might have been added"

### Expected Behavior
Based on the implementation and usage patterns:
1. The function should restore all modified attributes to their original values
2. The function should remove any attributes that were added after the backup was created
3. This enables test isolation by ensuring one test's modifications to Options don't affect other tests

### Documentation Assessment
Since this is an internal test utility:
- The lack of formal documentation is acceptable
- The function's intent is clear from its usage context and inline comments
- The bug occurs in implementing the documented intent ("strip Options from new keys")

The bug is not a documentation issue but a genuine implementation bug where the code fails to correctly implement the intended behavior described in the comment.
