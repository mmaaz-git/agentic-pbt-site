## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug as reported. The issue is confirmed:

### Test Results:

1. **Basic Dictionary Mutation (Test 1):**
   - Input: `{'x': 'value', 'y': 42}`
   - After substitute(): `{'x': 'value', 'y': 42, '__template_name__': None, 'z': 100}`
   - The method added `__template_name__` and namespace values ('z': 100) to the input dict

2. **Template with No Namespace (Test 2):**
   - Input: `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`
   - After substitute(): `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, '__template_name__': None}`
   - Even without a namespace, `__template_name__` is added

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - All test dictionaries were mutated
   - In every case, at minimum `__template_name__` was added
   - When template has a namespace, those keys are also added to the input dict

### Code Analysis:

The bug is in lines 182-185 of _tempita.py:
```python
ns = kw  # Line 182: Creates alias, not a copy!
ns['__template_name__'] = self.name  # Line 183: Mutates the original dict
if self.namespace:
    ns.update(self.namespace)  # Line 185: Also mutates the original dict
```

Line 182 assigns `ns = kw`, which makes `ns` an alias to the same dictionary object, not a copy. All subsequent modifications to `ns` directly affect the caller's dictionary.

### Comparison with string.Template:

Python's standard `string.Template.substitute()` does NOT mutate the input dictionary:
- Input: `{'name': 'World'}`
- After substitute(): `{'name': 'World'}` (unchanged)
- This confirms the expected behavior for template substitution methods

### Verification:

The bug report is accurate:
1. The substitute() method does mutate the input dictionary
2. It adds internal keys like `__template_name__`
3. It adds namespace values to the input dict
4. This behavior violates the principle of least surprise
5. The behavior differs from string.Template, which the documentation references
