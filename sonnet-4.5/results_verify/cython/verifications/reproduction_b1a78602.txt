## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Code Examination
I examined the RawCodeRange class in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Plex/Regexps.py`:

- Lines 208-211: The `__init__` method correctly stores the code range as `self.range = (code1, code2)`
- Line 224: The `calc_str` method incorrectly tries to access `self.code1` and `self.code2`

### Bug Reproduction
Both the Hypothesis test and the direct reproduction code confirmed the bug:

1. When running `str(RawCodeRange(50, 60))`, an AttributeError is raised: "'RawCodeRange' object has no attribute 'code1'"

2. The attributes check confirmed:
   - `rcr.range` exists: True (contains tuple (50, 60))
   - `rcr.code1` exists: False
   - `rcr.code2` exists: False

### Impact
This bug causes a crash (AttributeError) whenever the string representation of a RawCodeRange object is needed. This would affect:
- Debugging (when printing the object)
- Logging
- Error messages that include the object's string representation
- Any code that explicitly calls `str()` on a RawCodeRange object

### Fix Verification
The suggested fix is correct. Changing line 224 from:
```python
return "CodeRange(%d,%d)" % (self.code1, self.code2)
```
to:
```python
return "CodeRange(%d,%d)" % self.range
```
would resolve the issue, as `self.range` contains the tuple (code1, code2) and is the correct attribute to use.

The bug report is accurate and the reproduction steps work exactly as described.
