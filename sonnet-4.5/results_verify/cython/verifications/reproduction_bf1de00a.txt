## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Setup
I attempted to reproduce the reported bug using the provided test cases that demonstrate the infinite loop in `cymeit` when using float timers that return values less than 0.2.

### Reproduction Attempts

#### Test 1: Direct cymeit call with zero-returning float timer
- **Result**: The test timed out after 5-10 seconds, indicating the function entered an infinite loop
- **Observation**: The function began compiling the Cython code but never completed
- **Conclusion**: This confirms the infinite loop behavior

#### Test 2: Simulation of autorange() logic
I created a direct simulation of the `autorange()` function to better understand the issue:

**Float timer returning 0.0**:
- The loop ran indefinitely (stopped at 100 iterations for safety)
- Each iteration increased the `number` variable exponentially (1, 10, 100, 1000...)
- The timer value (0.0) never exceeded min_runtime (0.2)
- No sanity check was triggered because `timer_returns_nanoseconds` was False
- **Result**: CONFIRMED INFINITE LOOP

**Integer timer returning 0**:
- The sanity check at line 377-379 triggered after iteration 2
- When number=10 and time_taken=0, the condition `(time_taken < 10 and number >= 10)` was met
- Raised RuntimeError: "Timer seems to return non-ns timings"
- **Result**: Properly caught and terminated

**Float timer returning 0.1**:
- Similar to the 0.0 case, ran indefinitely
- Value of 0.1 is still less than min_runtime (0.2)
- **Result**: CONFIRMED INFINITE LOOP

### Technical Analysis
The bug occurs because:
1. Line 366 sets `min_runtime = one_second / 5 = 0.2` for float timers
2. Line 375 checks `if time_taken >= min_runtime` to exit the loop
3. If a float timer consistently returns < 0.2, this condition is never met
4. The sanity check at lines 377-379 only applies when `timer_returns_nanoseconds` is True
5. There is no maximum iteration limit or timeout for float timers

### Bug Confirmation
**The bug is CONFIRMED**. The `autorange()` function in `cymeit` will enter an infinite loop when:
- A float timer is used (not integer/nanosecond)
- The timer consistently returns values less than 0.2 seconds
- This includes broken timers, mocked timers in tests, or timer implementation bugs

The issue is a missing termination condition for float timers that consistently return small values.
