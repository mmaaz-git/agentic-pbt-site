REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The parse_list function in Cython.Build.Dependencies crashes with a KeyError when parsing strings containing unclosed quote characters.

Test Results:
-------------
1. Input: "'" (single quote) → KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
2. Input: '"' (double quote) → KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
3. Input: "[']" (quote in brackets) → KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
4. Input: "0'" → Result: ["0'__Pyx_L1_"] (does NOT crash, but returns malformed output)
5. Input: "#" → Result: ['#__Pyx_L1_'] (does NOT crash, but returns malformed output)

The bug occurs exactly as described in the report. The root cause appears to be in the interaction between:
1. The strip_string_literals() function that normalizes strings to '__Pyx_L{n}_' format
2. The unquote() helper function that tries to look up these normalized labels

When strip_string_literals processes an unclosed quote like "'", it produces:
- normalized string: "'__Pyx_L1_"
- literals dictionary: {"__Pyx_L1_": ""}

The unquote() function then slices this as literal[1:-1], getting "__Pyx_L1" (without trailing underscore), but the dictionary key has the underscore, causing the KeyError.

The bug is reproducible and matches the report's description exactly.
