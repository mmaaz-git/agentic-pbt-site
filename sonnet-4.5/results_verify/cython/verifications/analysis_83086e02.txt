## Triage Analysis

### BUG - Why it might be a bug:
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: The function has two code paths that handle duplicates differently - the `**/` path uses a `seen` set to prevent duplicates, while the brace expansion path doesn't
2. **Unintended consequences**: Duplicate files in the result can lead to compiling the same file multiple times, which is inefficient and could cause errors
3. **Clear fix available**: The bug report provides a reasonable fix that makes the behavior consistent
4. **Internal consistency suggests intent**: The fact that one code path already prevents duplicates suggests this was the intended behavior
5. **Practical impact**: While the severity is low, this could affect build systems and cause unnecessary recompilation

### WONTFIX - Why it might be wontfix:
1. **Low severity**: The bug only occurs with patterns that have duplicate alternatives, which is uncommon in practice
2. **Workaround exists**: Users can easily avoid this by not using duplicate alternatives in their patterns
3. **Rare edge case**: Most users won't write patterns like `{a,a}.txt` intentionally

### INVALID - Why it might be invalid:
1. **No documented behavior**: There's no documentation stating that duplicates should be prevented
2. **Could be intentional**: Some globbing systems do return duplicates when patterns match the same file multiple times
3. **Python's glob allows duplicates**: The standard Python glob documentation mentions duplicates can occur with `**` patterns

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be a documentation fix:
1. **Undocumented function**: The function has no docstring or official documentation
2. **Ambiguous intent**: Without documentation, it's unclear what the intended behavior should be
3. **Could document as limitation**: Could document that brace expansion may return duplicates

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be a feature request:
1. **Enhancement**: Adding duplicate prevention could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix
2. **Not standard behavior**: Brace expansion itself is an extension beyond standard Python glob

### DECISION

This should be categorized as **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Internal inconsistency is the strongest indicator**: Within the same function, one code path (`**/`) explicitly prevents duplicates using a `seen` set (lines 54-68), while another (brace expansion, lines 42-49) doesn't. This inconsistency within a single function strongly suggests an oversight rather than intentional design.

2. **The fix is trivial and improves consistency**: The proposed fix simply applies the same deduplication logic already present in the function to the other code path.

3. **Practical negative impact**: Returning duplicate file paths can cause files to be processed multiple times in cythonize(), leading to inefficiency and potential compilation errors.

4. **User expectations**: Users reasonably expect a glob-like function to return unique file paths, especially when used in a build system context where duplicate processing is problematic.

While the severity is low and the edge case is rare, the internal inconsistency and practical implications make this a valid bug that should be fixed rather than documented as expected behavior.
