BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code incorrectly constructs UnicodeDecodeError and UnicodeEncodeError with 1 argument instead of required 5
- This causes a TypeError with a confusing message instead of the intended error message
- The same file shows the correct pattern elsewhere (lines 359-364), proving this is a mistake
- The bug can be triggered with custom objects that raise UnicodeDecodeError in __str__
- The error messages clearly show intent to inform users about missing encoding

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug is difficult to trigger with normal Python objects
- In typical usage with bytes values, Python 3's str() behavior prevents hitting this code path

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The bug requires unusual/contrived objects to trigger (objects with __str__ that raises UnicodeDecodeError)
- Normal usage patterns don't encounter this issue
- The code path might be considered "dead code" in Python 3

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is clearly incorrect and will fail when executed
- The fix is trivial and improves code correctness
- Other projects might use custom objects that could trigger this

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The provided simple test case (b'\xff') doesn't actually trigger the bug

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug definitely exists in the code, even if the simple test doesn't trigger it
- The code will fail with TypeError when executed
- I successfully triggered the bug with a custom object

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be seen as requesting better error messages

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken code, not adding new functionality
- The intended error messages already exist but can't be displayed due to the bug

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue
- The code fails to execute as written

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code contains incorrect exception construction that will fail with a TypeError when executed. While the bug requires specific conditions to trigger (custom objects with special __str__ behavior), the code is objectively incorrect and fails when those paths are taken. The developer clearly intended to raise UnicodeDecodeError/UnicodeEncodeError with helpful messages but made a mistake in the constructor calls. The fix is straightforward and improves code correctness.
