## Documentation Analysis

### Documentation Findings

1. **No method-level documentation:**
   - The `from_filename` method has NO docstring
   - No inline comments explaining the encoding parameter behavior
   - The method signature shows `encoding=None` as default, strongly suggesting it should be optional

2. **Module-level documentation:**
   - The module docstring describes the templating language syntax
   - Mentions using the Template class and substitute() method
   - Does NOT mention from_filename() method at all
   - Does NOT discuss file encoding requirements

3. **Class attributes:**
   - The Template class defines `default_encoding = 'utf8'` at line 96
   - This attribute is used elsewhere in the code for encoding/decoding during template execution
   - The presence of this default strongly implies automatic encoding should work

4. **External documentation:**
   - Cython's official documentation briefly mentions "Tempita templating language" but provides no details
   - GitHub repository has no specific documentation for this method
   - No README or dedicated docs for the Tempita submodule

5. **Test coverage:**
   - The existing test file only tests from_filename WITH explicit encoding
   - No tests for the default case (encoding=None)
   - This suggests the default behavior may never have worked properly

### Documentation Implications

The lack of documentation makes this situation ambiguous. However:

1. The method signature with `encoding=None` as a default parameter strongly implies it should be optional
2. The existence of `default_encoding = 'utf8'` class attribute suggests there's an intended fallback
3. Python convention is that parameters with default values should work without being specified
4. The function name `from_filename` is a common pattern (like `from_string`, `from_file`) that typically "just works" with reasonable defaults

### Conclusion

While there's no explicit documentation stating the encoding should be optional, the code structure and Python conventions strongly suggest this is the intended behavior. The bug prevents the most basic use case from working, which would be surprising to any user.
