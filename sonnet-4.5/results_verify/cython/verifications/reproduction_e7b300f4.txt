BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The Template class in Cython.Tempita crashes when attempting to parse bytes content, despite having explicit support for bytes through the `_unicode` flag.

## Test Results

1. **Manual Reproduction**: Confirmed
   - Creating a Template with bytes content `b"Hello {{name}}"` raises:
     `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`
   - The error occurs at line 581 in _tempita.py in the lex() function
   - Stack trace matches exactly what was reported

2. **Hypothesis Property-Based Test**: Confirmed
   - The property test fails immediately on any non-empty bytes input
   - Falsifying example: `value='0'` (when encoded to bytes)
   - All bytes content causes the same TypeError

3. **Control Tests**:
   - String content works perfectly: `"Hello {{name}}"` -> `"Hello World"`
   - Empty bytes still crash: `b""` raises the same TypeError
   - Plain bytes without template syntax also crash: `b"Hello World"` raises the same error

## Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs in the `lex()` function (line 581) when it tries to apply a string regex pattern to bytes content:
```python
token_re = re.compile(r'%s|%s' % (re.escape(delimiters[0]), re.escape(delimiters[1])))
for match in token_re.finditer(s):  # s can be bytes, but token_re is always a string pattern
```

## Evidence of Intent to Support Bytes
The code clearly intends to support bytes content:
1. Line 125: `self._unicode = isinstance(content, str)` - explicitly tracks whether content is unicode
2. Lines 336-346: The `_repr()` method has specific logic to handle bytes vs unicode
3. Line 340: Explicit conversion path: `value = bytes(value)`
4. Lines 351-359: Unicode/bytes conversion handling with encoding support
5. Line 155: `from_filename()` reads files in binary mode ('rb')

The infrastructure for bytes support exists throughout the codebase, but the lexer was never updated to handle bytes input.

## Conclusion
This is a legitimate bug. The Template class has explicit support infrastructure for bytes content but fails at the lexical analysis stage due to a type mismatch between the regex pattern (always string) and the content being searched (can be bytes).
