## Bug Report Analysis

### BUG (Valid bug report)
**Why it could be a BUG:**
1. **Clear logic error**: The code sorts files by access time then reverses the list, causing newest files to be deleted first
2. **Defeats cache purpose**: A cache that removes recently used items first provides no benefit over no cache at all
3. **Intentional time tracking**: The code explicitly updates access times when files are used (`os.utime(cached, None)`), showing intent to track recency
4. **Conventional expectation**: Caches universally implement LRU (remove least recently used) unless specified otherwise
5. **Performance impact**: This bug would cause significant performance degradation by constantly recompiling recently used files
6. **Simple fix**: The fix is trivial (remove `reversed()`) and makes the behavior sensible

**Evidence supporting BUG classification:**
- Reproducible test cases confirm the incorrect behavior
- The implementation is clearly backwards from what any reasonable cache should do
- No documentation suggests this backwards behavior is intentional

### INVALID
**Why it could be INVALID:**
1. No explicit documentation states it should be LRU
2. The method has no docstring specifying expected behavior

**Counter-argument:** Even without explicit documentation, a cache that removes newest items first is nonsensical and defeats the fundamental purpose of caching. The behavior is so obviously wrong that documentation isn't needed to establish it as incorrect.

### WONTFIX
**Why it could be WONTFIX:**
- None. This is a significant bug that affects core functionality and has real performance implications.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it could be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The documentation could be updated to warn users about this behavior
2. Could add a docstring explaining the cleanup policy

**Counter-argument:** Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct. The implementation is fundamentally flawed and should be fixed, not documented as-is.

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it could be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could argue that proper LRU behavior is a "new feature" since it was never explicitly promised

**Counter-argument:** This isn't adding new functionality but fixing fundamentally broken existing functionality. A cache that removes newest items isn't a "different kind of cache" - it's a broken cache.

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation does the opposite of what any reasonable cache should do. The code tracks access times and uses them for cleanup, but then processes files in reverse order, removing the most recently used files first. This is not a matter of preference or undocumented behavior - it's objectively incorrect behavior that defeats the entire purpose of having a cache.

The bug is:
- Reproducible
- Has significant negative impact
- Has a clear, simple fix
- Represents obviously incorrect logic

No reasonable developer would intentionally design a cache to remove the most recently used items first while keeping the least recently used items.
