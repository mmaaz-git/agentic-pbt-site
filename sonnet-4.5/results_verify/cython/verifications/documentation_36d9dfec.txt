## Documentation Analysis

### Available Documentation

1. **Cython Debugging Documentation**: The official Cython documentation at https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/debugging.html describes the `cy locals` command simply as a command that "Print[s] all the local and global variables and their values." There is no specific mention of edge cases or behavior when there are no local variables.

2. **Code Documentation**: The docstring for `CyLocals` class (line 1244-1246) states: "List the locals from the current Cython frame." This is a minimal description that doesn't specify behavior for empty local variable sets.

3. **Sibling Class Documentation**: The `CyGlobals` class (lines 1272-1274) has a similar minimal docstring: "List the globals from the current Cython module."

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not explicitly specify:
- What should happen when there are no local variables
- Whether the command should handle empty variable sets gracefully
- Expected error behavior or edge cases

### Implied Behavior

While not explicitly documented, several factors suggest the expected behavior:

1. **Consistency with similar commands**: The sibling command `CyGlobals.invoke` handles empty dictionaries gracefully, suggesting this is the intended pattern.

2. **GDB command mapping**: The `CyLocals.invoke` method is decorated with `@dispatch_on_frame(c_command='info locals', python_command='py-locals')`, indicating it's meant to be equivalent to GDB's `info locals` command. GDB's `info locals` command handles functions with no local variables gracefully by simply printing nothing or an empty list.

3. **User expectation**: A debugging command that crashes when encountering a valid program state (a function with no locals) violates the principle of least surprise. Users would reasonably expect the command to handle this case gracefully.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly state that functions with no local variables must be handled gracefully. However, the lack of documentation about error conditions, combined with:
- The implementation pattern in the sibling `CyGlobals` class
- The behavior of equivalent GDB commands
- Reasonable user expectations for a debugging tool

All suggest that crashing on empty local variables is unintended behavior rather than a documented limitation.
