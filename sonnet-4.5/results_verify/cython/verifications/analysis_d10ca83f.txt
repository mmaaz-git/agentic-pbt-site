## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### 1. INVALID - Why it's NOT invalid:
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The code clearly intends to raise PlexTypeError but fails due to Python 3 incompatibility
- The AttributeError about missing types.InstanceType is not the intended behavior
- This is not a case of "raising exceptions that are not as useful" - the exception doesn't get raised at all

#### 2. WONTFIX - Why it's NOT wontfix:
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects ALL invalid type validation in Plex
- The error occurs on basic, normal usage (passing wrong types to constructors)
- This is not about internal functions - Seq, Alt, Rep1 are public API
- The impact is significant: users get cryptic errors instead of helpful ones

#### 3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it's NOT just a documentation issue:
- The code is broken, not the documentation
- Even if we documented "wrong_type crashes in Python 3", that wouldn't fix the problem
- The implementation clearly shows what should happen, it just doesn't work

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it's NOT a feature request:
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The error handling mechanism already exists but is broken
- This is fixing existing broken code, not adding features

#### 5. BUG - Why this IS a valid bug:
✓ The code uses `types.InstanceType` which was removed in Python 3.0
✓ This causes an AttributeError instead of the intended PlexTypeError
✓ The bug affects public API methods (Seq, Alt, Rep1, etc.)
✓ The impact is significant - all type validation error messages are broken
✓ The fix is straightforward and correct
✓ Python 3 has been out since 2008, so this is a clear compatibility issue

### Additional Considerations

**Severity Assessment:**
- High severity as claimed in the report
- Affects basic error handling for a core module
- Makes debugging user errors much harder

**Fix Evaluation:**
The proposed fix is reasonable but could be improved. Instead of:
```python
if hasattr(value, '__class__') and hasattr(value.__class__, '__module__'):
```

A simpler fix would be:
```python
if hasattr(value, '__class__'):
```

Since all Python 3 objects have __class__, and we can handle the __module__ attribute separately.

### Conclusion
This is a clear, valid BUG that should be filed and fixed. It's a Python 2 to Python 3 compatibility issue that breaks error handling in a public API.
