Documentation Analysis for Cython.Build.Cache.load_from_cache
==============================================================

1. Cython Cache Module Documentation:
   - No external documentation found for the Cache module (404 on readthedocs)
   - The module is internal to Cython.Build and appears to be an implementation detail
   - No docstrings exist for the load_from_cache method itself

2. Function Purpose (inferred from code):
   - The Cache class manages compilation cache for Cython files
   - store_to_cache: Saves compilation artifacts (c_file, h_file, i_file, api_file)
   - load_from_cache: Restores cached compilation artifacts
   - When multiple files exist, they are stored in a zip archive with basenames only
   - When a single file exists, it's stored as gzip

3. Python zipfile.extract Documentation:
   - zipfile.ZipFile.extract(member, path=None, pwd=None)
   - Extracts member to the directory specified by 'path'
   - Creates the file at: path/member
   - If path is omitted, extracts to current working directory

4. Expected Behavior (from test suite):
   - TestCyCache._test_multi_file_output shows that after cache loading:
     * Files should exist at their expected locations: a.c, a.h, a_api.h
     * These files should be directly in the output directory
     * Not in subdirectories

5. How Cython Uses the Cache:
   - In Main.py, cache.load_from_cache(output_filename, cached) is called
   - output_filename is the target .c file location
   - The cache should restore all artifacts to the same directory as output_filename

6. No Documentation Specifies:
   - The exact extraction behavior is not documented
   - The bug report's interpretation appears reasonable based on:
     * How the cache is used in Main.py
     * What the test suite expects
     * The symmetry with store_to_cache which uses os.path.basename

The documentation does not explicitly state where files should be extracted, but the test suite and usage patterns strongly suggest files should be extracted to the directory containing the c_file, not to nested subdirectories.
