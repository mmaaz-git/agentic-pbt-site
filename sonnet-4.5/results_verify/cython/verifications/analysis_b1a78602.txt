## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The code has a clear implementation error: `calc_str()` references `self.code1` and `self.code2` which don't exist
- The `__init__` method stores values in `self.range` as a tuple, not as separate attributes
- This causes a crash (AttributeError) whenever string representation is needed
- The fix is straightforward and obvious
- Even though it's marked "for internal use only," internal code still needs to work correctly
- Other parts of Cython.Plex might need to get string representations for debugging or error messages

**Strength:** STRONG - This is a clear implementation bug with an obvious fix.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The class is marked "For internal use only"
- Users shouldn't be directly instantiating or using RawCodeRange
- The bug only affects string representation, not the core functionality of matching characters

**Strength:** WEAK - Being internal doesn't excuse broken code, especially for basic operations like string representation.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The class is internal use only
- If the string representation is never actually called in practice within Cython.Plex, fixing it might be unnecessary
- The core functionality (pattern matching) still works correctly

**Strength:** WEAK - Even internal code should have working string representations for debugging purposes.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Not applicable - this is clearly a bug, not a missing feature

**Strength:** NONE

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code could be considered "working as implemented" and the documentation could be updated to note that string representation is not supported

**Strength:** VERY WEAK - This would be a poor resolution as the implementation is clearly wrong.

### Analysis Summary
This is a straightforward implementation bug where the `calc_str()` method references non-existent attributes. The method tries to access `self.code1` and `self.code2` when the actual implementation stores these values in `self.range` as a tuple.

Key factors:
1. **Clear coding error:** The implementation doesn't match the class's own attribute structure
2. **Breaks standard Python behavior:** String representation should work for all objects
3. **Easy to fix:** The solution is trivial and obvious
4. **Impacts debugging:** Even internal classes need string representation for debugging
5. **No ambiguity:** The code is objectively wrong - it references attributes that don't exist

The fact that it's marked "for internal use only" doesn't change that this is a bug. Internal code still needs to function correctly, especially for standard operations like string representation that are essential for debugging.
