## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug in `Cython.Tempita._tempita.fill_command` function.

### Code Inspection
The source code at line 1073 in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Tempita/_tempita.py` shows:

```python
if name.startswith('py:'):
    name = name[:3]  # This keeps only "py:" instead of stripping it
    value = eval(value)
```

This is clearly incorrect as it keeps the first 3 characters ("py:") rather than removing them.

### Test Results
1. **Direct reproduction test**: When processing `py:my_var=42`, the variable name becomes 'py:' instead of 'my_var'.

2. **Property-based test**: All test cases fail because every variable name like `py:x`, `py:my_var`, `py:test_variable` gets reduced to just 'py:'.

### Effects of the Bug
1. All Python-evaluated command-line arguments overwrite each other since they're all stored with the same key 'py:'
2. Templates cannot access variables by their intended names
3. Only the last py: prefixed argument survives in the vars dictionary
4. The feature is completely broken - it's impossible to use multiple py: arguments

### Comparison with Template Parsing
Interestingly, the same module correctly handles `{{py:x=1}}` syntax in templates at line 753:
```python
if expr.startswith('py:'):
    expr = expr[3:].lstrip(' \t')  # Correctly strips the prefix
```

This inconsistency shows this is definitely a typo/bug in the command-line argument parsing code.
