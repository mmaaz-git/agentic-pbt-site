BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluation of Each Category
----------------------------

**INVALID**
Reasons it might be INVALID:
- The function has no documented contract about being warning-free
- extended_iglob is an internal/undocumented function
- The code still works correctly despite the warning

Reasons it's NOT INVALID:
- Python officially deprecated this syntax in 3.13
- The warning indicates actual future breakage, not just a preference
- Users shouldn't see deprecation warnings from library internals
- The issue is with Cython's code not conforming to Python standards

**WONTFIX**
Reasons it might be WONTFIX:
- Low severity - just a warning, not an error
- Only affects Python 3.13+ users
- Easy for users to filter warnings if needed

Reasons it's NOT WONTFIX:
- Will become a breaking error in future Python versions
- Trivial one-word fix (adding 'maxsplit=')
- Affects all users on modern Python versions
- Standard practice to fix deprecation warnings promptly

**DOCUMENTATION_FIX**
Reasons it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- Function lacks documentation entirely
- Could document that warnings may occur on Python 3.13+

Reasons it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code behavior is incorrect per Python standards
- This is a code issue, not a documentation mismatch
- Documenting warnings doesn't fix the underlying problem

**FEATURE_REQUEST**
Reasons it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could be seen as requesting "warning-free operation" as a new feature

Reasons it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Not requesting new functionality
- The function already works, just needs syntax update
- Following Python deprecation is maintenance, not a feature

**BUG**
Reasons it IS a BUG:
- Uses officially deprecated Python syntax
- Generates warnings in normal operation on Python 3.13+
- Will break completely in future Python versions
- Trivial fix available (change positional to keyword argument)
- Libraries should not generate deprecation warnings from their internals
- The fix is backward compatible with older Python versions
- Aligns with Python's documented migration requirements

Analysis Summary
----------------
This is a clear BUG. The code uses deprecated Python syntax that:
1. Currently generates warnings on Python 3.13+
2. Will cause errors in future Python versions
3. Has a trivial, backward-compatible fix
4. Violates the principle that libraries shouldn't expose deprecation warnings from their internals

The bug report is accurate, well-documented, includes a working reproduction case, and provides the correct fix.
