## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed:

### What the bug report claims:
When `validate_logit_bias()` receives a dictionary with integer-convertible keys but values outside the range [-100, 100], it raises a specific error "Value must be between -100 and 100" but this immediately gets caught and replaced with the generic "Invalid key-value pair in logit_bias dictionary".

### Reproduction results:

1. **Direct reproduction**: When calling `validate_logit_bias({"100": 150})`, the function returns:
   - Actual output: "Invalid key-value pair in logit_bias dictionary"
   - Expected output: "Value must be between -100 and 100"

2. **Hypothesis test**: The property-based test correctly fails, demonstrating that:
   - For input `{'0': 101}` (valid key, out-of-range value), the specific range error is masked
   - For input `{':': 101}` (invalid key), the generic error is appropriate

### Code analysis:
Looking at lines 421-429 of the actual implementation:
```python
try:
    int_key = int(key)
    int_value = int(value)
    if -100 <= int_value <= 100:
        validated_logit_bias[int_key] = int_value
    else:
        raise ValueError("Value must be between -100 and 100")
except ValueError:
    raise ValueError("Invalid key-value pair in logit_bias dictionary")
```

The problem is clear: The `except ValueError` block catches ALL ValueErrors, including:
1. Errors from `int(key)` conversion (legitimate use of generic message)
2. Errors from `int(value)` conversion (legitimate use of generic message)
3. The specific range validation error on line 427 (problematic - loses useful information)

This makes debugging harder because users don't know whether their error is due to:
- Non-integer keys/values
- Out-of-range values

The bug is valid and reproducible.
