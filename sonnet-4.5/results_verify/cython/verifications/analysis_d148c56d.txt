## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments for:**
- The parse_default function DOES have a bug - it will crash with IndexError if called with a token like `('default ', position)`
- The code at line 881 assumes there will be content after 'default ' when splitting
- A defensive check would prevent the IndexError

**Arguments against:**
- The bug never occurs in normal usage through the Template API
- The parser design prevents parse_default from ever being called with problematic input
- The test case provided doesn't actually reproduce the claimed behavior
- The actual behavior (treating `{{default}}` as an expression) is reasonable

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments for:**
- The bug report's reproduction steps are incorrect - they don't produce an IndexError
- The hypothesis test fails because the expected behavior doesn't match reality
- The claimed scenario (IndexError on `{{default}}`) doesn't happen in practice
- The bug report misunderstands how the parser works

**Arguments against:**
- There IS a potential IndexError in parse_default if called incorrectly
- The code could be more robust with additional validation

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments for:**
- The IndexError only occurs if someone directly calls parse_default with malformed input
- This is an internal function not meant to be called directly
- The normal parsing flow prevents this from ever happening
- Adding defensive code for an impossible scenario adds unnecessary complexity

**Arguments against:**
- Simple fix would make the code more robust
- Good practice to handle edge cases even if they're unlikely

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments for:**
- The request is really asking for better error messages for malformed default directives
- Currently `{{default}}` is silently treated as an expression rather than giving a clear error
- Could be seen as requesting enhanced validation

**Arguments against:**
- The bug report specifically claims there's a crash (IndexError) which is incorrect
- It's framed as fixing a bug, not adding a feature

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments for:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly say what happens with malformed default directives
- Users might expect `{{default}}` to raise a TemplateError
- Could clarify that incomplete directives fall back to expression evaluation

**Arguments against:**
- The current behavior is reasonable given the parser design
- Documentation shows correct syntax; malformed syntax behavior is implementation detail

### Conclusion

This bug report is **INVALID** because:

1. The reported crash (IndexError) does not occur with the provided test cases
2. The hypothesis test expectation (TemplateError) is incorrect
3. The actual behavior (NameError from expression evaluation) is reasonable and consistent with the parser design
4. The parse_default function is never called with the problematic input in normal usage
5. The bug report fundamentally misunderstands how the Tempita parser identifies and processes directives

While parse_default could be made more robust with defensive programming, the reported bug doesn't exist in practice. The current behavior of treating `{{default}}` as a Python expression (which then fails with NameError) is a reasonable design choice, not a bug.
