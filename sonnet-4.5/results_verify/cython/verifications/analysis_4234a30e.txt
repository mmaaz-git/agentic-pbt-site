BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS

== Consideration for Each Category ==

### BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function clearly computes a result but fails to return it
- The function name strongly implies it should return corrected text
- The parameter is accepted but never used, indicating incomplete implementation
- The function performs meaningful computation that is wasted without a return statement

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is never called anywhere, so it has no actual impact
- It could be intentionally incomplete placeholder code

**Verdict:** STRONG CANDIDATE - This is a legitimate implementation error

---

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is never used, so there's no specified behavior to violate
- No documentation exists defining what the function should do
- Could be argued that an unused function can do whatever it wants

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function name clearly indicates intent to return corrected text
- The implementation shows clear intent to process and return data
- The missing return statement is an obvious oversight, not a design choice

**Verdict:** UNLIKELY - The bug is real regardless of whether the function is used

---

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is completely unused dead code
- It's in a test file, not production code
- The bug has zero impact since the function is never called
- Fixing dead code provides no value
- The test suite works fine without this function

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Dead code should still be correct or removed
- The fix is trivial (one line)

**Verdict:** STRONG CANDIDATE - Dead code with no impact

---

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as requesting the function be completed
- The function doesn't currently have any functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a bug (missing return), not a missing feature
- The function already implements the logic, just fails to return it

**Verdict:** UNLIKELY - This is a bug, not a feature request

---

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- There's no documentation saying what the function should do
- Could add documentation saying "this function does nothing"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is clearly broken, not the documentation
- No documentation exists to fix
- The function name itself documents the expected behavior

**Verdict:** UNLIKELY - The code is wrong, not documentation

---

== Final Analysis ==

This bug report describes a real implementation error where a function:
1. Accepts a parameter it never uses
2. Computes a result it never returns
3. Has a name that clearly indicates it should return something

However, the critical factor is that **this function is never called anywhere in the codebase**. It is completely dead code that has no impact on any functionality.

Given that:
- The function is unused test utility code
- It has zero impact on any actual tests or functionality
- It appears to be abandoned/forgotten code
- The bug is trivial but fixing it provides no value

This should be categorized as **WONTFIX** - while technically a bug, it's in dead code that should either be removed entirely or left as-is since it has no effect.
