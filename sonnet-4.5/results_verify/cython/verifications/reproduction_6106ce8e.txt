Bug Reproduction Analysis
==========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the technical details:

1. Test Execution Results:
   - Input '00': Returns range [48, 50) which covers {'0', '1'} instead of just {'0'}
   - Input 'aaa': Returns range [97, 100) which covers {'a', 'b', 'c'} instead of just {'a'}
   - Input 'aabbcc': Returns range [97, 103) which covers {'a','b','c','d','e','f'} instead of just {'a','b','c'}
   - Input 'abc': Correctly returns range [97, 100) covering {'a', 'b', 'c'}
   - Input '0': Correctly returns range [48, 49) covering {'0'}

2. Algorithm Analysis:
   The bug occurs in the while loop condition at line 43:
   ```python
   while i < n and code2 >= ord(char_list[i]):
   ```

   When processing duplicate characters:
   - For '00': After processing first '0', code2=49. When checking second '0' (ord('0')=48),
     the condition 49 >= 48 is TRUE, causing code2 to increment to 50, thus including '1'.
   - The algorithm incorrectly extends the range when encountering duplicates.

3. The Proposed Fix:
   Changing the condition from `>=` to `>` would fix the issue:
   ```python
   while i < n and code2 > ord(char_list[i]):
   ```
   This ensures duplicates are skipped without extending the range.

4. Impact Verification:
   The bug affects the Any() constructor, which uses chars_to_ranges internally.
   Any('00') would incorrectly match both '0' and '1', violating its documented behavior
   of matching "any character in the string |s|".

Conclusion:
The bug report is technically correct. The function produces incorrect output when given
strings with duplicate characters, including characters not present in the input.
