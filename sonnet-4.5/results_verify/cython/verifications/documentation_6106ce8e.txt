Documentation Analysis for chars_to_ranges function
====================================================

Function Definition:
The chars_to_ranges function is defined in Cython/Plex/Regexps.py with the following docstring:

"""
Return a list of character codes consisting of pairs
[code1a, code1b, code2a, code2b,...] which cover all
the characters in |s|.
"""

Key Documentation Points:
1. The function should "cover all the characters in |s|" - this is the explicit requirement
2. The output format is pairs of [start_code, end_code) representing ranges
3. The function is used internally by the Any() constructor

Any() Constructor Documentation:
The Any() function is documented as:
"Any(s) is an RE which matches any character in the string |s|."

This means Any() should match ONLY the characters that are present in the input string s.

Critical Observation:
The documentation explicitly states the function should cover "all the characters in |s|" - it does NOT say it should cover additional characters beyond those in the input. The phrase "cover all" means it should include exactly the set of characters present, not more.

The Any() documentation reinforces this: it should match "any character in the string |s|" - meaning only characters that exist in s, not additional ones.

Conclusion:
Based on the documentation, chars_to_ranges should produce ranges that cover exactly the unique characters in the input string, no more and no less. If the function produces ranges that include characters not present in the input (like including '1' when only '0' is in the input), this violates the documented behavior.
