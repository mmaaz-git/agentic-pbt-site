BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Category Considerations

### 1. BUG - Why this could be a valid bug:
✓ **Code doesn't work as intended**: The `_have_importers()` function exists specifically to prevent duplicate installations, but fails due to incorrect logic
✓ **Clear implementation error**: The isinstance check logic is objectively wrong - it checks for a subclass relationship that doesn't exist
✓ **Reproducible failure**: The bug is consistently reproducible with the provided test cases
✓ **Performance impact**: Multiple import hooks degrade Python's import performance
✓ **Memory impact**: Each duplicate installation consumes memory
✓ **Violates reasonable expectations**: Install functions are typically idempotent in Python
✓ **The fix is straightforward**: The proposed fix correctly addresses the logic error

### 2. INVALID - Why this might be invalid:
✗ **Not invalid**: The code clearly attempts to check for existing importers but fails
✗ **Documentation doesn't explicitly promise idempotence**: While true, the code structure shows clear intent
✗ **Could argue it's user error to call multiple times**: Weak argument given the existence of `_have_importers()`

### 3. WONTFIX - Why this might be wontfix:
✗ **Not obscure**: This affects anyone using `pyimport=True` and calling install() multiple times
✗ **Not trivial**: Performance degradation from duplicate import hooks is a real issue
✗ **pyimport is marked "experimental"**: Could argue experimental features don't need to be perfect
  - However, the bug is in core logic that also affects the interaction with pyximport

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why this might be a feature request:
✗ **Not a new feature**: The code already attempts to implement idempotence
✗ **Not an enhancement**: This is fixing broken existing functionality
✗ **The `_have_importers()` function exists**: Shows this was intended behavior, not a new request

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why this might be a documentation fix:
✗ **Not just a documentation issue**: The code is objectively broken
✗ **Code intent is clear**: The existence of `_have_importers()` shows the intended behavior
△ **Could document the limitation**: But fixing the code is more appropriate than documenting a bug

## Additional Considerations

### Severity Assessment:
- **Medium severity**: Not a crash or data loss, but causes performance degradation
- **Affects experimental feature**: `pyimport=True` is marked as experimental
- **But also affects**: The combination of `pyximport=True` and `pyimport=True`

### Code Quality:
- The bug is a simple logic error in class hierarchy checking
- The fix is minimal and low-risk (changing nested isinstance to separate checks)
- The bug report includes a working fix

### User Impact:
- Users who call `install()` in multiple modules will experience degraded import performance
- Long-running applications that might reinstall hooks will accumulate importers
- The issue is silent - no errors or warnings, just degraded performance

### Testing:
- The bug report provides comprehensive test cases
- Both property-based and direct reproduction methods
- The fix can be easily validated

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG** that should be fixed:

1. The code contains an objective logic error (incorrect isinstance nesting)
2. The function fails to achieve its documented intent (checking for existing importers)
3. The bug has real negative impacts (performance degradation, memory usage)
4. The fix is simple and correct
5. While pyimport is "experimental", the core logic error also affects pyximport combinations
6. The presence of `_have_importers()` proves idempotence was intended

The bug report is well-written, accurate, and includes:
- Clear reproduction steps
- Correct root cause analysis
- Working fix
- Property-based test for validation

This should be categorized as BUG and fixed.
