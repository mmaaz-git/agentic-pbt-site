## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function never explicitly states in its documentation that it will validate input or provide helpful error messages for invalid formats. The docstring only shows an example and references PEP 440 without claiming full compliance. Since the function is in Cython.Utils (suggesting it's an internal utility), it might be reasonable to expect callers to provide valid input. The function does exactly what it claims for valid inputs - it parses and translates version identifiers into hex format.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function crashes with cryptic errors on invalid input rather than handling them gracefully. The reference to PEP 440 in the documentation creates an expectation that the function understands version formats. The error messages expose implementation details rather than indicating what went wrong with the input, which is poor practice even for internal utilities.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal utility function in Cython.Utils, not a public API. The unhelpful error messages, while not ideal, still indicate that something went wrong. The function works correctly for all valid inputs, and callers (presumably other Cython internal code) should be providing valid version strings. Adding extensive validation for an internal utility that's likely called with known-good inputs could be considered unnecessary overhead. The maintainers might consider this a trivial issue not worth the effort to fix.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Error messages that say "invalid literal for int()" provide no useful information to developers trying to debug issues. Even internal utilities benefit from clear error messages. The suggested fix is simple and would make the function more robust without significant performance impact. Poor error messages can waste developer time when debugging.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify what happens with invalid input, what exceptions might be raised, or what constitutes a valid version string beyond one example. The function works as implemented - it just needs documentation to clarify that it expects valid input and will raise ValueError on invalid input. Adding documentation about expected input format and potential exceptions would resolve the issue without changing the code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The bug report is about the quality of error messages when the function fails, not about missing documentation. Simply documenting that "ValueError may be raised" doesn't address the core complaint that the error messages are unhelpful. The issue is with the implementation's error handling, not with unclear documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function currently doesn't validate input or provide helpful error messages - adding this capability would be a new feature. Input validation with descriptive error messages is an enhancement beyond the current functionality. The function works for its intended use case (valid version strings), and the request is to add better handling for invalid cases. This could be seen as requesting the function to do something it was never designed to do.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Proper error handling is not a feature - it's a basic expectation of robust code. The function already raises exceptions on invalid input; the issue is that these exceptions are unhelpful. Improving existing error messages is typically considered a bug fix, not a new feature. The function claims to parse version identifiers, which implies it should handle parsing failures gracefully.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function raises cryptic, implementation-exposing error messages that provide no useful information about what went wrong. When a function that parses version strings encounters an invalid version string, it should indicate that the version string is invalid, not expose internal implementation details. Poor error messages that expose implementation details are generally considered bugs in software engineering. The error "invalid literal for int()" tells nothing about version string requirements.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function never promised to validate input or provide helpful error messages. It's an internal utility function that works correctly for all valid inputs as documented. The documentation doesn't specify error handling behavior, so any error behavior could be considered acceptable. The function does fail on invalid input (as it should), just not with perfect error messages.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report concerns an internal utility function (`Cython.Utils.build_hex_version`) that crashes with unhelpful error messages when given invalid input. The function successfully parses valid version strings but fails with cryptic "invalid literal for int()" errors on invalid input, exposing implementation details rather than indicating the actual problem.

The key question is whether an internal utility function should be expected to provide helpful error messages. The function is not a public API, and its docstring doesn't promise input validation or specific error handling. It simply states it parses version identifiers and references PEP 440 for context. The function works correctly for all valid inputs tested.

While better error messages would certainly be an improvement, this appears to be an internal utility where the callers (other Cython code) should be providing valid input. The maintainers would likely view this as either WONTFIX (not worth fixing for an internal utility) or potentially INVALID (the function works as designed for valid input). The fact that this is marked as "Medium" severity for what amounts to unhelpful error messages in an internal utility suggests the bug report may be overstating the issue's importance.
