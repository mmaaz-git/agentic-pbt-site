DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR DistutilsInfo.merge
===============================================

1. FORMAL DOCUMENTATION
-----------------------
No formal documentation was found for the DistutilsInfo.merge method. The method has no docstring, and there is no external documentation that describes its intended behavior.

2. CODE COMMENTS
----------------
The only documentation is an inline comment on line 223:
   "# Change a *copy* of the list (Trac #845)"

This comment suggests that the intent is to work with a COPY of the list to avoid aliasing issues. The reference to "Trac #845" indicates this was a previously identified bug that was fixed, but the fix appears incomplete.

3. INFERRED BEHAVIOR FROM CODE STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------
Based on the code analysis:
- The merge() method is designed to merge configuration values from another DistutilsInfo object into self
- It handles different types of values differently:
  - transitive_str: Only sets if key doesn't exist in self
  - transitive_list: Should merge lists, avoiding duplicates
  - bool_or: Performs logical OR operation

4. KEY TYPES IN distutils_settings
-----------------------------------
The following keys are defined as transitive_list type:
- 'libraries'
- 'library_dirs'
- 'runtime_library_dirs'
- 'include_dirs'
- 'extra_compile_args'
- 'extra_link_args'
- 'depends'

5. INTENDED BEHAVIOR FROM COMMENT
----------------------------------
The comment explicitly states the code should "Change a *copy* of the list". This strongly suggests that:
- The merge operation should NOT create aliases between lists
- Modifications to the merged object should NOT affect the source object
- Each DistutilsInfo object should maintain independent copies of its lists

6. LACK OF SPECIFICATION
-------------------------
There is no formal specification for:
- Whether merge should create deep or shallow copies
- How nested structures should be handled
- What the exact semantics of "transitive" mean in this context
- Whether the behavior should differ when a key exists vs. doesn't exist

However, the explicit comment about changing a "copy" provides clear intent that aliasing should be avoided, regardless of whether the key already exists in self.values.
