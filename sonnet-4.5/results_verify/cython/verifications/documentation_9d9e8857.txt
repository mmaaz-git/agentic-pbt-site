## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `cap_length` function has NO documentation - no docstring, no inline comments explaining its purpose. The only information available is:
1. The function name itself: `cap_length`
2. The parameter names: `s` and `max_len`
3. Default value: `max_len=63`

### Implied Contract from Function Signature
Based on standard programming conventions:
- Function name `cap_length` strongly implies it will cap/limit the length of something
- Parameter `max_len` (short for "maximum length") clearly indicates the maximum allowed length
- The function should ensure the returned string has length â‰¤ max_len

### Usage Context in Codebase
The function is used internally in 3 locations:
1. Line 3521: `cap_length("_".join(arg_names))` - uses default max_len=63
2. Line 5655: `cap_length('__and_'.join(...))` - uses default max_len=63
3. Line 5700: `cap_length(re.sub(...))` - uses default max_len=63

All current usage relies on the default `max_len=63`, which explains why this bug hasn't caused issues in practice.

### Comments About the Function
Line 3523-3526 contains a comment acknowledging that using cap_length twice can produce strings longer than the individual caps, but states "this is significantly shorter than compilers should be able to handle". This suggests the function's purpose is to ensure C identifier names don't exceed compiler limits.

### Documentation Verdict
There is no formal documentation that specifies:
- What should happen for very small max_len values
- Whether there's a minimum supported max_len
- The exact format of the output when truncation occurs

However, the function name and parameter name create a clear implicit contract that the function should cap string length at max_len. The current behavior violates this reasonable expectation based on naming conventions alone.
