## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function has no documentation specifying how comments should be handled. Without explicit documentation stating that comments must be preserved with their '#' prefix intact, one could argue that the current behavior is not technically a bug but just undefined behavior. The function name only mentions "strip_common_indent" without promising to preserve comment structure.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code explicitly checks for comments in TWO places, showing clear intent to handle them specially. The first loop skips comments when calculating min_indent, and the second loop attempts to skip comment lines from indentation stripping. This demonstrates that the developer intended comments to be preserved, making the current behavior (deleting comments) clearly wrong.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered an edge case that rarely occurs in practice - it only affects comments that have no indentation when the surrounding code is indented. Most Python code follows consistent indentation where comments are aligned with code. The bug has existed in the codebase without being noticed, suggesting it doesn't affect many users.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Silent data loss is a serious issue. The function completely deletes user comments without warning, which could remove important documentation or disable code that was commented out. This is not a trivial formatting issue but actual loss of user data during code processing.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function lacks any documentation about its intended behavior. If the current behavior of potentially removing comments was intentional, then the fix would be to document this limitation rather than change the code. Users should be warned that comments without indentation might be lost.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code structure strongly suggests comments should be preserved - there's explicit logic to identify and skip comment lines. The implementation has a clear bug (using a stale variable) rather than a design choice. Documenting broken behavior instead of fixing an obvious programming error would be inappropriate.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that preserving comments is a new feature request since the function never explicitly promised to handle comments correctly. The request would be to enhance the function to properly preserve all comment types and positions.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The existing code already attempts to preserve comments - it has explicit checks for '#' characters in two places. This isn't asking for new functionality but fixing existing functionality that's broken due to a programming error (stale variable usage).

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code clearly intends to preserve comments (checks for '#' in two places) but fails due to using a stale loop variable. This is a classic programming error where 'indent' retains its value from the first loop and is incorrectly reused in the second loop. The fix is simple and obvious - use the current line's match position instead of the stale variable. The bug causes data loss by deleting comments.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug is the lack of explicit documentation promising comment preservation. However, this is a weak argument given the clear intent shown in the implementation.

## Overall consideration
This is clearly a BUG. The code demonstrates unmistakable intent to preserve comments through its dual checking mechanism - first excluding comments from minimum indent calculation, then attempting to skip them during indentation stripping. The failure occurs due to a textbook programming error: reusing a stale loop variable ('indent') from the first loop in the second loop's logic. This creates incorrect array indexing that causes comments to be truncated or deleted entirely.

The bug is not about ambiguous requirements or missing features - it's about broken implementation of clearly intended functionality. The function attempts to preserve comments but fails due to incorrect variable scoping. The proposed fix is minimal, surgical, and directly addresses the root cause by using the correct variable (match.start()) instead of the stale one.

Most importantly, this bug causes silent data loss - user comments disappear without warning. This is precisely the type of bug that should be fixed rather than documented or dismissed as an edge case. The fact that the fix is simple and obvious further supports treating this as a legitimate bug rather than a documentation issue or feature request.
