BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The code has a clear intent stated in the comment: "strip Options from new keys that might have been added"
   - The function crashes with RuntimeError when attempting to perform its documented purpose
   - This is a known Python 3 issue: modifying a dictionary while iterating over it
   - The bug is 100% reproducible
   - The fix is simple and standard: use list(dict.keys()) instead of dict.keys()
   - The function is actively used in test infrastructure (setUp/tearDown patterns)
   - Failure prevents proper test isolation

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - None significant

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - None

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug is real and reproducible
   - The code comment explicitly states the intended behavior
   - The RuntimeError is a genuine Python error, not user error

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - This is test utility code, not production code
   - Only affects internal test infrastructure

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Test infrastructure is critical for project health
   - The bug prevents tests from properly isolating state
   - The fix is trivial (one-line change) but the impact is significant
   - Without this fix, tests cannot add attributes to Options during testing

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
   Arguments FOR:
   - None

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The comment clearly shows this behavior is already intended
   - The code attempts to implement this feature but fails due to a bug

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error)
   Arguments FOR:
   - There's no formal documentation for these functions

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code comment is the documentation and it's correct
   - The implementation is wrong, not the documentation/comment

CONCLUSION:
This is clearly a BUG. The code has an explicit comment stating it should "strip Options from new keys that might have been added", but instead it crashes with a RuntimeError when attempting to do so. This is a well-known Python 3 issue where modifying a dictionary during iteration raises an error. The bug affects test isolation and has a simple, standard fix.
