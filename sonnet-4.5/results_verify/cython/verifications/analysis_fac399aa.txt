## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior could be considered working as designed because the documentation doesn't explicitly promise that mixing pyrex_* and cython_* parameters should work. The backwards compatibility layer was designed for pure pyrex_* usage, not mixed usage. Users mixing old and new parameter styles might be considered an unsupported use case.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug is technically real and reproducible - when users provide explicit cython_* parameters, those parameters are silently ignored if any pyrex_* parameter is present. This violates the principle of least surprise and explicit user intent should be honored.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case involving mixing deprecated pyrex_* parameters with modern cython_* parameters. Pyrex has been obsolete for many years, and users should have fully migrated by now. The effort to fix this might not be worth it for such a rare scenario.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is straightforward and the bug causes silent data loss (user-specified parameters are ignored). Even if pyrex is deprecated, the backwards compatibility code exists and should work correctly when used. Silent failures are particularly problematic.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation never explicitly states that mixing pyrex_* and cython_* parameters is supported. Adding documentation to warn users not to mix these parameter styles would be sufficient to clarify the expected behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code has a clear bug where explicit parameters are lost during the recursive call. This is not just a documentation issue but an actual implementation problem where user intent is not preserved.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting mixed pyrex_*/cython_* parameters could be seen as a new feature since it was never explicitly supported. The current code was designed for pure backwards compatibility, not gradual migration scenarios.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not asking for new functionality but for existing parameters to be honored correctly. When a user explicitly sets cython_gdb=True, that's not a feature request - it's an expectation that the parameter will be used.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is clearly a bug. The code loses explicitly-provided user parameters silently. The recursive call in lines 47-63 fails to pass through the cython_* parameters, causing them to revert to defaults. This is unintended behavior that violates user expectations and makes gradual migration from pyrex to cython impossible.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug would be if mixing parameter styles was never intended to be supported, but there's no documentation stating this restriction, and the code doesn't raise an error when both are provided.

## Overall consideration
After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate BUG. The code has a clear implementation flaw where the recursive Extension.__init__() call fails to pass through the cython-specific parameters when pyrex options are present. This causes silent data loss where user-specified parameters are ignored without warning.

The bug is particularly problematic because it fails silently - users have no indication that their cython_* parameters are being ignored. The fix is also straightforward and low-risk, involving simply ensuring the cython_* parameters are included in the recursive call.

While pyrex is deprecated, the backwards compatibility code exists and should function correctly. The principle of least surprise suggests that explicitly provided parameters should be honored regardless of whether other deprecated parameters are also present. This is a valid bug that should be fixed.
