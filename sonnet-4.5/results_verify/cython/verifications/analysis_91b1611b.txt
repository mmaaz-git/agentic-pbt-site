## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function's behavior with the `or` operator could be considered intentional design - treating falsy values as "not explicitly set" and thus falling back to extension defaults. Without explicit documentation stating that falsy values should be preserved, one could argue this is working as intended. The function might be designed to only override extension values when the builder has a "meaningful" (truthy) value set.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code comments clearly establish that command-line options should take precedence over extension options. The boolean_options declaration indicates these are meant to be boolean flags that can be False. Users explicitly setting `cython_cplus=0` or using `--no-cython-cplus` command-line flags have clear intent to disable features, which the current implementation ignores. The distutils/setuptools convention is that command-line options override configuration.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This behavior has likely existed for a long time and changing it could break existing build scripts that rely on the current behavior. Some users might depend on setting builder options to 0 or False and expecting the extension values to be used. The impact might be considered minor since users can work around it by not setting the builder value at all if they want extension defaults.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it prevents users from explicitly disabling features via command-line options, which is a fundamental expectation in build systems. The bug affects core functionality of overriding build settings. The fix is straightforward and the current behavior is clearly counterintuitive to standard command-line option precedence rules.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The get_extension_attr method has no explicit documentation, so one could argue the documentation should be updated to clarify that falsy builder values are ignored. The current behavior could be documented as intentional, explaining that only truthy builder values override extension settings.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code comments already establish the precedence pattern (command-line first, extension second), and the current implementation violates this documented pattern. The boolean_options declaration suggests these should work as boolean flags. Documenting broken behavior doesn't fix the underlying issue that users cannot disable features via command-line.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that supporting explicit False/0 values to override extension settings is a new feature that wasn't originally intended. The current implementation might have been designed to only override with "positive" settings, and adding support for explicit false values would be an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not requesting new functionality but rather fixing existing functionality to work as expected. Boolean command-line options inherently support both True and False states. The distutils convention and the code's own comments indicate this should already work. It's a bug fix, not a feature addition.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The implementation clearly violates the precedence rules documented in the code comments. Boolean command-line options should be able to be set to False to override extension settings. The current behavior makes it impossible to disable features via command-line when extensions have them enabled. This breaks the fundamental contract of command-line options taking precedence over configuration, which is standard across build systems. The boolean_options declaration explicitly marks these as boolean options that should support False values.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug is if the `or` operator usage was intentional design to treat falsy values as "unset". However, there's no documentation supporting this interpretation, and it contradicts both the code comments and standard build system conventions.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate BUG. The code comments explicitly state that command-line options should take precedence ("Start with the command line option"), which establishes the intended behavior. The current implementation using the `or` operator violates this documented precedence by ignoring falsy builder values.

The fact that these options are declared as `boolean_options` in the class definition strongly suggests they are intended to support both True and False states. A user setting `cython_cplus=0` or using `--no-cython-cplus` has clear intent to disable C++ mode, regardless of what the extension specifies. The current implementation makes it impossible to disable features via command-line when extensions have them enabled, which is a fundamental violation of how build systems typically work.

While one could argue this behavior has existed for a while and might be relied upon, the violation of documented precedence rules and the inability to properly disable features makes this a clear bug rather than a documentation issue or feature request. The proposed fix is reasonable and would bring the implementation in line with both the documented behavior and user expectations.
