## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation

The `build_hex_version` function has a clear docstring that states:
- Purpose: "Parse and translate public version identifier like '4.3a1' into the readable hex representation '0x040300A1' (like PY_VERSION_HEX)"
- Reference: "SEE: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers"

The function explicitly references PEP 440 as the standard it follows for public version identifiers.

### PEP 440 Requirements

According to PEP 440 (Python Enhancement Proposal for Version Identification and Dependency Specification):

1. **Pre-release versions are valid with or without numbers**: The PEP explicitly states in the "Implicit pre-release number" section:
   > "Pre releases allow omitting the numeral in which case it is implicitly assumed to be `0`. The normal form for this is to include the `0` explicitly. This allows versions such as `1.2a` which is normalized to `1.2a0`."

2. **Valid pre-release formats**:
   - X.YaN (Alpha release)
   - X.YbN (Beta release)
   - X.YrcN (Release Candidate)
   - Where N can be omitted and defaults to 0

3. **Examples from PEP 440**:
   - '1.2a' is valid and normalized to '1.2a0'
   - '1.0rc' is valid and normalized to '1.0rc0'

### Expected Behavior

Based on the documentation:
- The function should handle version strings like '1.0a', '1.0b', '1.0rc' without trailing numbers
- These should be treated as equivalent to '1.0a0', '1.0b0', '1.0rc0' respectively
- The function should produce valid hex output for these inputs

### Current Behavior vs Documentation

The current implementation crashes on inputs that PEP 440 explicitly states are valid. Since the function documentation directly references PEP 440, it should comply with all valid version formats defined in that PEP.

The function works correctly for:
- '1.2.3a1' → 0x010203A1
- '4.3a1' → 0x040300A1

But crashes on valid PEP 440 versions:
- '1.0a' → ValueError (should be treated as '1.0a0' → 0x0100xxA0)
- '1.0rc' → ValueError (should be treated as '1.0rc0' → 0x0100xxC0)

This is a clear violation of the documented behavior, as the function claims to follow PEP 440 but does not handle all valid PEP 440 version strings.
