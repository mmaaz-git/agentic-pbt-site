DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function Documentation
----------------------
1. **extended_iglob function**:
   - No docstring present in the function
   - No inline help documentation available
   - Function signature: extended_iglob(pattern)
   - Purpose (inferred from code): Extends Python's iglob to support additional glob patterns including '**/' for recursive directory matching and '{a,b}' for alternatives

2. **Cython Documentation**:
   - Public Cython documentation does not mention extended_iglob specifically
   - The function appears to be an internal utility used by cythonize()
   - Documentation mentions glob pattern support but doesn't detail the implementation

3. **Python re.split() Documentation**:
   - Official Python docs confirm the deprecation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split)
   - Signature: re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)
   - Deprecation note: "Deprecated since version 3.13: Passing maxsplit and flags as positional arguments is deprecated. In future Python versions they will be keyword-only parameters."

4. **Contract/Specification**:
   - No explicit specification exists for extended_iglob
   - Function behavior is implementation-defined
   - No documented contract about warning-free operation

Documentation Implications
--------------------------
1. The function has no documented contract about not generating warnings
2. However, as an internal utility function, it's reasonable to expect it to work without warnings on supported Python versions
3. The Python documentation clearly states that positional maxsplit is deprecated
4. The fix aligns with Python's documented migration path

Conclusion
----------
While extended_iglob lacks explicit documentation about warning-free operation, the deprecation warning is a genuine issue because:
- It's caused by using deprecated Python syntax
- Python's documentation explicitly states this usage is deprecated
- The function should follow current Python best practices
- Users of Cython shouldn't see deprecation warnings from Cython's internal code
