DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR pyximport.handle_special_build

## Function Purpose
The handle_special_build function in pyximport.py is designed to process special build configurations defined in .pyxbld files. These files allow users to customize how Cython modules are built without needing a full setup.py file.

## .pyxbld File Format
Based on the source code and web documentation:
1. A .pyxbld file can define two optional functions:
   - make_ext(modname, pyxfilename): Returns a distutils.extension.Extension object
   - make_setup_args(): Returns a dictionary of setup arguments for distutils

2. These functions are used to customize the build process:
   - make_ext defines the Extension object with sources, include dirs, libraries, etc.
   - make_setup_args provides additional arguments to the setup() call

## Code Analysis of handle_special_build (lines 110-133)
The function's logic is:
1. It looks for a .pyxbld file matching the .pyx file
2. If found, it loads the module and looks for make_ext and/or make_setup_args functions
3. Line 129-130: There's an assertion that checks "assert ext or setup_args"
   This explicitly allows EITHER ext OR setup_args to be present (not necessarily both)
4. Line 131-132: The code unconditionally accesses ext.sources regardless of whether ext is None

## Documentation Gap
I could not find official Cython documentation that explicitly states whether make_setup_args alone (without make_ext) is a supported use case. The web search results show examples always using make_ext, sometimes with make_setup_args as well, but no examples of make_setup_args alone.

However, the code itself is clear:
- The assertion at line 129 explicitly allows for the case where only setup_args is provided (ext could be None)
- This suggests the intent was to support make_setup_args without make_ext
- The unconditional access to ext.sources at line 131 is inconsistent with this intent

## Conclusion
The code's own assertion logic (line 129) documents the intended behavior: either make_ext or make_setup_args should be sufficient. The fact that the code crashes when only make_setup_args is provided violates this documented constraint within the code itself.
