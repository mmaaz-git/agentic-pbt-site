## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in `normalise_float_repr` from Cython.Utils.

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test immediately fails with negative floats that have negative exponents. The test found multiple failing cases, confirming the bug is not limited to a single edge case.

2. **Specific Failing Case**: The reported case `-3.833509682449162e-128` produces the malformed output:
   - Input: `-3.833509682449162e-128`
   - Output: `.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000-3833509682449162`

   This output cannot be converted back to a float, raising a ValueError.

3. **Pattern of Failure**: Testing additional cases shows that ALL negative numbers with negative exponents fail:
   - `-1e-10` → `.00000000-1` (INVALID)
   - `-2.5e-50` → `.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000-25` (INVALID)
   - `-9.9e-100` → `.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000-99` (INVALID)

4. **When It Works**: Negative numbers with positive exponents work correctly:
   - `-5e10` → `-50000000000.` (VALID)
   - `-3.14e5` → `-314000.` (VALID)

### Root Cause:
The bug occurs because on line 665, the function calls `float_str.lower().lstrip('0')` which strips leading zeros. For a negative number like `-0.000...123`, this strips the zeros but leaves the minus sign orphaned, resulting in the minus appearing in the middle of the output string instead of at the beginning.

The bug is 100% reproducible and affects all negative floating-point numbers with negative exponents when represented in scientific notation.
