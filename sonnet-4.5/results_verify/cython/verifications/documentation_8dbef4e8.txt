## Documentation Analysis for Cython.Plex Eof Pattern

### Documentation Found:

1. **Cython/Plex/__init__.py** docstring:
   - Lists "Eof" as one of the regular expression constructors for building pattern definitions for a Lexicon
   - States these are "for building pattern definitions for a Lexicon"

2. **Cython/Plex/Regexps.py**:
   - Eof is defined as: `Eof = Char(EOF)` where EOF = 'eof'
   - Docstring: "Eof is an RE which matches the end of the file."

3. **Cython/Plex/Lexicons.py** docstring:
   - Clearly states that token definitions are tuples of (pattern, action)
   - Actions can be:
     a) A function that returns a value (or None to continue scanning)
     b) Special actions like IGNORE or TEXT
     c) "Any other value, which is returned as the value of the token"
   - This documentation explicitly states that non-function action values should be "returned as the value of the token"

4. **Cython/Plex/Scanners.py** read() method docstring:
   - States: "Returns (None, '') on end of file"
   - This appears to be hardcoded behavior, but doesn't mention that Eof patterns are ignored

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. The Lexicon documentation clearly states that action values (including constants) should be returned as token values
2. There is NO documentation stating that Eof patterns are treated differently from other patterns
3. The Scanner documentation says EOF returns (None, ''), but doesn't mention this overrides Eof pattern actions
4. All other patterns (Str, Any, Range, etc.) correctly honor their action values as documented

### Documentation Inconsistency:

The documentation creates a reasonable expectation that:
- Eof is a pattern like any other RE pattern
- Patterns can have associated actions that determine the return value
- These actions should work consistently across all pattern types

However, the implementation violates this expectation by hardcoding None for EOF, making the Eof pattern's action specification meaningless. This is an undocumented exception to the general pattern-action contract.
