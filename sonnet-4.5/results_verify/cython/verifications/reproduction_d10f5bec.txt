REPRODUCTION OF BUG: Cython.Tempita Parser Accepts Duplicate else Clauses

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported. Here's my analysis:

1. PROPERTY-BASED TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - The property-based test attempts to create a Template with duplicate else clauses
   - Expected behavior: Should raise TemplateError with message containing "duplicate" or "multiple"
   - Actual behavior: Template is created successfully without raising any error
   - The test FAILS because no exception is raised

2. MANUAL REPRODUCTION:
   - Created template with structure:
     {{if False}}
       A
     {{else}}
       B
     {{else}}
       C
     {{endif}}

   - Expected behavior: Should raise an error about duplicate else clauses
   - Actual behavior: Template parses successfully without error
   - Output when substituted: Only outputs "B" (the first else clause)
   - The second else clause "C" is silently ignored

3. SOURCE CODE EXAMINATION:
   - Found the parse_cond function in /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Tempita/_tempita.py
   - Line 291 contains a comment: "# @@: if/else/else gets through"
   - This comment confirms the author was aware of this issue
   - The parse_cond function (lines 800-813) loops through tokens and calls parse_one_cond
   - It never checks if an else clause has already been seen
   - The _interpret_if function (lines 289-301) processes parts sequentially and stops at first truthy condition
   - When it encounters 'else', it automatically treats it as True (line 296)
   - This explains why only the first else clause is executed

4. BEHAVIOR CONFIRMATION:
   - The bug is confirmed: Tempita accepts multiple else clauses in a single if/elif/else block
   - Only the first else clause is executed
   - Subsequent else clauses are parsed but ignored during execution
   - No error or warning is generated

The bug report accurately describes the issue. The parser does accept duplicate else clauses when it should reject them as a syntax error.
