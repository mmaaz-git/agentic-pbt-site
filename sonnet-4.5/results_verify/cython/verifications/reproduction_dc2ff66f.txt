## Bug Reproduction Report

### Bug Summary
The bug report correctly identifies an inconsistency in the Field.__repr__ method in Cython.Utility.Dataclasses. The repr output uses "kwonly=" while the actual attribute name is "kw_only" (with underscore).

### Code Examination
Looking at the source code in /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Utility/Dataclasses.py:

1. Line 33: The attribute is defined in __slots__ as 'kw_only'
2. Line 52: The attribute is set in __init__ as self.kw_only = kw_only
3. Line 66: The __repr__ method uses 'kwonly={!r},' (without underscore)
4. Line 70: The format arguments correctly reference self.kw_only

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test failed as expected, confirming the bug:
- Input: kw_only=None (or any value)
- Expected: repr output should contain "kw_only="
- Actual: repr output contains "kwonly=" instead
- Error message shows: "Expected 'kw_only=' in repr output, but got: Field(...,kwonly=None,)"

### Manual Reproduction Results
Running the manual reproduction code confirmed:
1. Creating a field with kw_only=True produces repr output with "kwonly=True"
2. The actual attribute is accessible as f.kw_only (returns True)
3. Attempting to access f.kwonly raises AttributeError: 'Field' object has no attribute 'kwonly'

### Impact
This is a genuine bug that causes an inconsistency between:
- The repr output (shows "kwonly=")
- The actual attribute name ("kw_only")
- Python conventions where repr should accurately reflect object attributes

This inconsistency makes debugging harder as users see one name in the repr but must use a different name to access the attribute. The bug report's assessment is accurate.
