## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Hypothesis Test Results

Running the provided hypothesis test with inputs consisting of quotes and spaces confirmed the bug. The test discovered multiple failing cases, including:
- Single quote: `'` -> KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
- Single double-quote: `"` -> KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
- Empty quotes: `''` -> KeyError: ''
- Empty double quotes: `""` -> KeyError: ''
- Quotes with spaces: `' "` -> Various KeyError exceptions

### Direct Reproduction

The exact example from the bug report was confirmed:
```python
from Cython.Build.Dependencies import parse_list
parse_list("'")
```

This produces:
```
KeyError: '__Pyx_L1'
```

The traceback matches the bug report exactly, occurring in the `unquote` function at line 132 of Dependencies.py.

### Root Cause Analysis

I investigated the issue and confirmed the root cause described in the bug report:

1. When `strip_string_literals("'")` is called, it returns:
   - Transformed string: `"'__Pyx_L1_"`
   - Literals dictionary: `{'__Pyx_L1_': ''}`

2. The `unquote` function then:
   - Detects the leading quote character
   - Tries to look up `literal[1:-1]` which is `"__Pyx_L1"` (missing the trailing underscore)
   - The actual key in the dictionary is `"__Pyx_L1_"` (with trailing underscore)
   - This mismatch causes the KeyError

The bug occurs because unclosed/unbalanced quotes result in a mismatch between the placeholder format used by `strip_string_literals` and the key extraction logic in `unquote`.

### Impact

This is a crash bug that occurs when parsing malformed input. The function `parse_list` is called from user-facing code that parses special comment directives in Cython source files (e.g., `# distutils: extra_compile_args = -O2 -Wall`). When users accidentally include unbalanced quotes in these directives, they get an obscure KeyError instead of a helpful error message.
