DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR handle_special_build() function
==========================================================

Source Code Documentation:
--------------------------
The documentation in pyximport.py (lines 17-28) provides the following information about .pyxbld files:

1. The module's docstring states: "A custom distutils.core.Extension instance and setup() args (Distribution) for for the build can be defined by a <modulename>.pyxbld file"

2. The example provided shows both functions being defined together:
   - def make_ext(modname, pyxfilename): returns an Extension instance
   - def make_setup_args(): returns a dict with setup arguments

3. The docstring uses "and" between the two purposes, suggesting both can be defined, but doesn't explicitly state whether both are required or if they can be defined separately.

Code Implementation Details:
----------------------------
Looking at the handle_special_build function implementation (lines 110-133):

1. Line 112-113: Initialize ext=None and setup_args={}
2. Lines 120-123: If make_ext exists, call it and assert that it returns a valid Extension with sources
3. Lines 124-128: If make_setup_args exists, call it and assert it returns a dict
4. Line 129: Assert that at least one of ext or setup_args is truthy (assert ext or setup_args)
5. Line 131-132: Unconditionally access ext.sources to adjust source paths

The assertion at line 129 clearly allows for either ext or setup_args to be None, as long as at least one is provided. This indicates that the code was designed to support three scenarios:
- Only make_ext defined (ext is set, setup_args is empty dict)
- Only make_setup_args defined (ext is None, setup_args is set)
- Both defined (both ext and setup_args are set)

External Documentation:
-----------------------
Based on web searches:
1. The official Cython GitHub repository shows the same implementation
2. Various examples and stackoverflow posts show .pyxbld files with either or both functions
3. No official Cython documentation explicitly states that both functions are required
4. The pyximport module is considered somewhat experimental/convenience feature

Documentation Ambiguity:
------------------------
The documentation doesn't explicitly state:
- Whether both functions are required or optional
- What happens when only one function is defined
- How the code should handle the case where ext is None

The comment in the docstring "A custom distutils.core.Extension instance and setup() args" could be interpreted as:
- Both are always provided (using "and")
- Either or both can be provided (common Python usage of "and" in feature descriptions)

The assertion at line 129 strongly suggests the intent was to allow either function alone, but the unconditional access to ext.sources at line 131 contradicts this design.
