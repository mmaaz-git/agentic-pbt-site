## Documentation Analysis for normalize_existing

### Function Documentation:

The function `normalize_existing0` has the following docstring:
```
Given some base directory ``base_dir`` and a list of path names
``rel_paths``, normalize each relative path name ``rel`` by
replacing it by ``os.path.join(base, rel)`` if that file exists.

Return a couple ``(normalized, needed_base)`` where ``normalized``
if the list of normalized file names and ``needed_base`` is
``base_dir`` if we actually needed ``base_dir``. If no paths were
changed (for example, if all paths were already absolute), then
``needed_base`` is ``None``.
```

### Key Observations:

1. **No explicit mention of duplicate handling:** The documentation does not specify whether the function should handle duplicate paths or whether it should deduplicate normalized paths.

2. **Purpose:** The function is part of Cython's build dependency system, used to normalize file paths during compilation.

3. **Current deduplication attempt:** The code does attempt some deduplication with `set(rel_paths)` in line 410, but this only removes exact string matches, not semantic duplicates.

4. **Function name implications:** The name "normalize_existing" suggests normalization, which typically implies creating a canonical representation. In path normalization contexts, this often includes deduplication of equivalent paths.

5. **No specification against duplicates:** The documentation doesn't explicitly state that duplicates are expected or desired in the output.

### Conclusion:

The documentation is silent on whether duplicate normalized paths should be handled. The function's name and the presence of `set(rel_paths)` suggest an intent to avoid duplicates, but the implementation fails to handle the case where different input representations (relative vs absolute) resolve to the same normalized path.
