# Bug Reproduction Analysis

## Test Execution

I successfully reproduced the reported bug using both the direct reproduction code and the Hypothesis property-based test.

### Direct Reproduction
The direct reproduction test confirmed the issue:
- Generated a first ULID: `01K61597J74D6XWJQYE7DQGETB`
- Simulated clock going backward by 2 milliseconds
- Generated a second ULID: `01K61597J5E56BB0CCGVTBERDT`
- Comparison showed: `ulid1 >= ulid2` (True)
- **Result: Monotonicity violation confirmed**

### Hypothesis Testing
The Hypothesis test ran multiple iterations and consistently failed with various backward time values (1ms to 1000ms). Every test case where the clock moved backward resulted in a monotonicity violation.

## Technical Analysis

The bug occurs because of how the `monotonic_ulid()` function handles different timestamp scenarios:

1. When `now_ms == last_ms`: The function correctly increments the randomness portion while keeping the same timestamp
2. When `now_ms != last_ms`: The function generates a completely fresh ULID with the current timestamp

The problem is in case #2: this includes both forward clock movement (`now_ms > last_ms`) and backward clock movement (`now_ms < last_ms`). When the clock moves backward, the function generates a new ULID with an earlier timestamp, which violates the strict monotonicity guarantee.

## Impact

The violation is significant because:
- ULIDs are lexicographically sorted primarily by their timestamp component (first 48 bits)
- When the timestamp goes backward, the entire ULID becomes smaller than the previous one
- This breaks the core guarantee stated in the function's docstring

## Conclusion

The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The function violates its documented guarantee of returning ULIDs that are "strictly larger" than all previously returned ULIDs when the system clock moves backward.
