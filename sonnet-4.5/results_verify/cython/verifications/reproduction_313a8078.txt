## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the hypothesis test and manual reproduction confirm the issue.

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test successfully found the issue. When run with various inputs, it consistently failed when attribute values contained control characters (characters with ASCII values < 32). The specific failing input `tag_name='a', attrs={'a': '\x1f'}` was found through reduction.

2. **Manual Test**: The manual reproduction code provided in the bug report also confirms the issue:
   - Input: `writer.add_entry('valid_tag', attr_with_control_char='\x1f')`
   - Result: `ValueError: All strings must be XML compatible: Unicode or ASCII, no NULL bytes or control characters`

### Stack Trace Analysis:

The error originates from lxml's XML validation when trying to add an attribute with a control character:
```
File "/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/DebugWriter.py", line 58, in add_entry
    self.tb.start(name, attrs)
    ...
File "src/lxml/apihelpers.pxi", line 1530, in lxml.etree._utf8
ValueError: All strings must be XML compatible: Unicode or ASCII, no NULL bytes or control characters
```

### Code Analysis:

Looking at the implementation of `add_entry` in DebugWriter.py:
```python
def add_entry(self, name, **attrs):
    if is_valid_tag(name):
        self.tb.start(name, attrs)  # Line 58 - passes attrs directly without validation
        self.tb.end(name)
```

The method passes attribute values directly to the XML TreeBuilder without validating them for XML compatibility. The `is_valid_tag` function only validates the tag name, not the attribute values.

### Impact:

This bug causes the entire debug writer to crash when it encounters attribute values containing control characters. This could happen when:
- Debug information contains string literals with control characters
- Variable names or values contain special characters
- File paths or other metadata contain unusual characters

The bug prevents the generation of debug information files, which impacts the ability to debug Cython-compiled code.
