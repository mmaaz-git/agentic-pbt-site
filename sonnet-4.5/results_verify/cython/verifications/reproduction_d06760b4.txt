Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug occurs in pyximport.get_distutils_extension() when non-string paths are passed as arguments.

## Reproduced Behavior

1. **Bytes path failure:**
   - When passing a bytes object (e.g., b'/tmp/test.pyx'), the function crashes
   - Error: "TypeError: can't concat str to bytes"
   - This occurs in handle_special_build() at line 111 when trying to concatenate bytes with a string (PYXBLD_EXT)

2. **Path object failure:**
   - When passing a pathlib.Path object (e.g., Path('/tmp/test.pyx')), the function crashes
   - Error: "AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'encode'"
   - This occurs at line 102 when the code tries to call encode() on a Path object

## Root Cause

The code contains Python 2 legacy logic at lines 99-102:
```python
if not isinstance(pyxfilename, str):
    # distutils is stupid in Py2 and requires exactly 'str'
    # => encode accidentally coerced unicode strings back to str
    pyxfilename = pyxfilename.encode(sys.getfilesystemencoding())
```

This code was meant to handle unicode strings in Python 2 but in Python 3:
- bytes objects pass the `not isinstance(pyxfilename, str)` check but don't have an encode() method
- pathlib.Path objects also pass the check but don't have an encode() method
- Even when bytes pass through unchanged (not hitting the encode call), they fail later when concatenated with strings

## Impact

The function fails to handle modern Python 3 path types (bytes and pathlib.Path) despite having code that suggests it was intended to handle non-string paths. This limits the usability of the function with modern Python conventions.
