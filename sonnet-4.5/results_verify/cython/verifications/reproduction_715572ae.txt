## Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report for `Cython.Compiler.Tests.Utils.restore_Options`.

### Reproduction Steps

1. I ran the exact reproduction code provided in the bug report, which adds a new attribute to the Options module and then attempts to restore the original state.

2. The code crashes with the exact error described: `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`

3. The hypothesis property-based test also fails with the same error when trying to test round-trip backup/restore operations.

### Verification of Bug

The bug is real and reproducible. The issue occurs in the `restore_Options` function at lines 22-24 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/cython_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/Cython/Compiler/Tests/Utils.py`:

```python
# strip Options from new keys that might have been added:
for name in vars(Options).keys():
    if name not in backup:
        delattr(Options, name)
```

This code attempts to iterate over the dictionary keys while simultaneously modifying the dictionary by deleting attributes, which is a well-known Python anti-pattern that raises `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`.

### Fix Verification

I tested the proposed fix by converting `vars(Options).keys()` to `list(vars(Options).keys())`, which creates a copy of the keys before iteration. This fix works correctly and allows the function to:
1. Successfully remove newly added attributes
2. Restore the Options module to its original state
3. Avoid the RuntimeError

The bug is legitimate and the proposed fix is correct.
