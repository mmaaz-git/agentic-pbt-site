DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing both the OpenAPI specification and FastAPI documentation:

1. OpenAPI 3.1.0 Specification (https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#server-variable-object):
   - The specification explicitly states for the `default` field:
   - "REQUIRED. The default value to use for substitution, which SHALL be sent if an alternate value is not supplied."
   - "If the `enum` is defined, the value MUST exist in the enum's values."
   - This is a clear, unambiguous requirement with the keyword "MUST" indicating it's mandatory

2. FastAPI Documentation:
   - The FastAPI reference documentation for ServerVariable doesn't explicitly mention the constraint
   - The implementation in fastapi/openapi/models.py (lines 90-93) shows:
     ```python
     class ServerVariable(BaseModelWithConfig):
         enum: Annotated[Optional[List[str]], Field(min_length=1)] = None
         default: str
         description: Optional[str] = None
     ```
   - There is no validation logic to enforce that default must be in enum when enum is provided

3. Conclusion:
   - The OpenAPI specification clearly requires this validation
   - FastAPI is meant to generate OpenAPI-compliant documents
   - The current implementation does not enforce this requirement
   - This is not a documentation issue but an implementation issue - the code should validate according to the spec
