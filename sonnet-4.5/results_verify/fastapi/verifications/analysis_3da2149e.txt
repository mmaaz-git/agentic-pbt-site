TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against five possible categorizations:

1. INVALID (Incorrect report, code works as designed):
   REASONS IT MIGHT BE INVALID:
   - No explicit RFC or specification requires ignoring empty values in comma-separated lists
   - The current behavior could be argued as "strict validation" which some might prefer
   - Documentation doesn't promise to handle malformed headers

   REASONS IT'S NOT INVALID:
   - The bug is real and reproducible
   - Current behavior causes real-world compatibility issues
   - Violates the principle of robustness in protocol implementations
   - Empty values carry no semantic meaning and should be ignored

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
   REASONS IT MIGHT BE WONTFIX:
   - Could argue that clients should send properly formatted headers
   - Edge case that may not affect many users

   REASONS IT'S NOT WONTFIX:
   - Has practical impact on real applications
   - Common scenario with programmatically generated headers
   - Easy fix that improves compatibility
   - Multiple users could encounter this with various HTTP clients/proxies

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
   REASONS IT MIGHT BE A FEATURE REQUEST:
   - Could be viewed as requesting "lenient parsing mode"
   - Specification doesn't explicitly require this behavior

   REASONS IT'S NOT A FEATURE REQUEST:
   - Not asking for new functionality, but fixing existing parsing
   - Current behavior rejects valid CORS requests unnecessarily
   - The headers themselves are valid; only the parsing is overly strict

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation doesn't match code):
   REASONS IT MIGHT BE DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - Documentation doesn't specify how malformed headers are handled
   - Could document that headers must be strictly formatted

   REASONS IT'S NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code behavior is genuinely problematic
   - Documentation isn't wrong; it just doesn't cover this edge case
   - Fixing documentation wouldn't solve the compatibility issue

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   REASONS IT IS A BUG:
   - Current implementation is overly strict without good reason
   - Violates principle of robustness (Postel's Law)
   - Causes unnecessary failures for valid CORS requests
   - Empty values have no semantic meaning and should be ignored
   - Fix is simple and improves compatibility
   - Real-world impact on applications using various HTTP clients
   - Common practice in HTTP parsing is to ignore empty values

   REASONS IT MIGHT NOT BE A BUG:
   - Specifications don't explicitly mandate this behavior
   - Could be seen as enforcing "clean" header formatting

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This should be categorized as a BUG. While specifications don't explicitly require
ignoring empty values, the current behavior:
1. Causes unnecessary compatibility issues
2. Violates common HTTP parsing practices
3. Has no security or functional benefit
4. Is easily fixed with minimal code changes
5. Improves real-world interoperability

The principle of robustness in network protocols strongly supports treating this
as a bug rather than expected behavior.
