DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Function Signature:
   The function signature from the help documentation shows:
   - `terms_of_service: Optional[str] = None`
   - This indicates the parameter accepts either a string or None
   - No restriction mentioned that strings must be non-empty

2. FastAPI Documentation:
   - Could not access the specific FastAPI documentation for `get_openapi` due to rate limits and 404 errors
   - The function's help text provides no specific guidance on empty string handling

3. OpenAPI Specification Context:
   - OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification allows string fields in the Info Object to be present with empty values
   - The Info Object fields like termsOfService are defined as strings with no minimum length requirement
   - JSON representation shows clear semantic difference between:
     * Field present with empty string: `"termsOfService": ""`
     * Field absent: (no termsOfService key)

4. Type Annotations:
   - The type hint `Optional[str]` means the value can be:
     * None (to indicate absence)
     * Any string value (including empty string "")
   - There's no type-level restriction against empty strings

5. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:
   - Since the parameter accepts `Optional[str]`, it should handle:
     * None → field omitted from output
     * "" (empty string) → field included with empty value
     * "value" → field included with the value

6. Current Implementation vs. Documentation:
   - The current implementation treats "" the same as None (both omit the field)
   - This behavior is not documented anywhere
   - The type hints suggest empty strings should be valid inputs

7. Consistency with OpenAPI Standards:
   - OpenAPI specifications commonly distinguish between absent fields and empty values
   - Many API documentation tools rely on this distinction for proper rendering
   - The current behavior breaks this standard distinction

CONCLUSION:
The documentation (both implicit through type hints and explicit through parameter names) suggests that empty strings should be valid and preserved. The current behavior of filtering out empty strings is undocumented and inconsistent with the type system and OpenAPI standards.
