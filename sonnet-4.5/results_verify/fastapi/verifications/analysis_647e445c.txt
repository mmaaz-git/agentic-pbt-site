## Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug report accurately describes a real crash that occurs
- The code genuinely fails on valid Python objects (dicts with tuple keys)
- The error message is confusing and doesn't indicate the real problem
- The documentation promises to handle "any object"

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- JSON specification doesn't support non-string keys anyway
- One could argue tuple keys in dicts are uncommon in web APIs

**Verdict: NOT INVALID** - The crash is real and the behavior violates the documented contract.

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Tuple keys in dictionaries are relatively uncommon in web API contexts
- The standard json.dumps() also doesn't handle tuple keys
- Users can work around this by pre-processing their data

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The error is confusing ("unhashable type: 'list'" doesn't explain the real issue)
- The function promises to handle "any object"
- Other non-string keys (int, float, bool, None) are handled fine
- The fix is straightforward and consistent with how JSON handles other non-string keys

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX** - This is more than a trivial edge case; it's a violation of the stated contract with a confusing error.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to state that tuple keys are not supported
- This would align with Python's json.dumps() behavior

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current behavior is a crash, not a designed limitation
- The function already handles other non-string keys successfully
- The error message is misleading (mentions lists, not tuples)
- The code could easily handle this case like it handles other non-string keys

**Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX** - This is a code bug, not a documentation issue.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting tuple keys could be seen as adding new functionality
- Python's json.dumps() doesn't support tuple keys either

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The function already claims to handle "any object"
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The function already handles other non-string key types
- The current behavior is inconsistent (handles int/float/bool/None but crashes on tuples)

**Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST** - This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new features.

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
1. **Clear crash**: The function crashes with a confusing error on valid Python input
2. **Violated contract**: Documentation says "convert any object" but fails on dicts with tuple keys
3. **Inconsistent behavior**: Successfully handles int/float/bool/None keys but crashes on tuple keys
4. **Misleading error**: Says "unhashable type: 'list'" when the user passed tuples
5. **Simple fix available**: Could convert tuple keys to strings like JSON does with other non-string keys
6. **Root cause identified**: The recursive encoding of keys causes tuples to become lists
7. **Unexpected internal failure**: The crash happens due to an internal transformation, not user error

**Arguments against BUG:**
- Python's json.dumps() also doesn't handle tuple keys

**Verdict: THIS IS A BUG** - The function crashes on valid input with a confusing error message, violating its documented contract.

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** because:
1. The function crashes instead of handling the input gracefully
2. The error message is misleading and doesn't help users understand the problem
3. The behavior is inconsistent with how other non-string keys are handled
4. The documentation promises to handle "any object" without mentioning this limitation
5. The crash is caused by an internal implementation detail (recursive key encoding)

The proposed fix (converting non-string keys to strings instead of recursively encoding them) is reasonable and consistent with JSON semantics.
