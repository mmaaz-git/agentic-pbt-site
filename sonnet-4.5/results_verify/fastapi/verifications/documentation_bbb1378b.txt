## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation Review

1. **get_swagger_ui_html Documentation**
   - Purpose: "Generate and return the HTML that loads Swagger UI for the interactive API docs"
   - Main use case: "You would only call this function yourself if you needed to override some parts"
   - Parameters documented:
     - `title`: "The HTML `<title>` content, normally shown in the browser tab"
     - `openapi_url`: "The OpenAPI URL that Swagger UI should load and use"

2. **get_redoc_html Documentation**
   - Purpose: "Generate and return the HTML response that loads ReDoc for the alternative API docs"
   - Similar use case for overriding default behavior
   - Same parameter descriptions as Swagger UI function

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **No Security Warnings**:
   - The documentation does NOT mention any security considerations
   - No warnings about XSS vulnerabilities
   - No mention of HTML escaping requirements
   - No guidance on handling user-controlled input

2. **Implied Safety**:
   - The documentation describes `title` as "HTML `<title>` content" which implies it should be safe HTML
   - However, there's no explicit statement that the input will be escaped
   - The phrase "HTML content" could be interpreted as expecting pre-escaped content

3. **Expected Usage Pattern**:
   - Documentation suggests these are typically called internally by FastAPI
   - FastAPI's own usage shows it passes `self.title` which comes from app configuration
   - The functions are public APIs that users can call directly

4. **HTML Generation Context**:
   - These functions explicitly generate HTML responses
   - Standard web security practice requires escaping user input in HTML contexts
   - The lack of escaping violates the principle of secure-by-default

### Security Best Practices
According to OWASP and standard web security guidelines:
- ALL user-controlled input must be escaped when rendered in HTML
- This is especially critical for:
  - HTML element content (like `<title>`)
  - JavaScript string literals
  - HTML attribute values
- Frameworks should provide secure-by-default behavior

### Documentation Gap
The documentation fails to:
1. Warn about XSS risks if user-controlled input is passed
2. Specify whether input is expected to be pre-escaped
3. Provide security guidance for safe usage
4. Document the actual behavior (no escaping)

### Conclusion
The lack of HTML escaping is a clear security vulnerability, not a documentation issue. While the documentation could be clearer about security, the fundamental problem is the unsafe code implementation that violates basic web security principles.
