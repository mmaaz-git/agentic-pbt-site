## Bug Reproduction Report

### Test Execution

I successfully reproduced the reported bug using both the provided test methods:

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - Ran the property-based test with the specific failing input `header_upper='A'`
   - The test failed as expected, confirming that different cases of the same header produce different internal states
   - Result: FAILED - cors_upper.allow_headers != cors_lower.allow_headers

2. **Manual Reproduction**:
   - Executed the provided reproduction code exactly as given
   - Observed output matched the bug report exactly:

   With uppercase 'A':
     allow_headers: ['a', 'accept', 'accept-language', 'content-language', 'content-type']
     preflight: A, Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language, Content-Type

   With lowercase 'a':
     allow_headers: ['accept', 'accept-language', 'content-language', 'content-type', 'a']
     preflight: Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language, Content-Type, a

   The headers are ordered differently and the preflight response headers have different casing.

### Source Code Analysis

Examined the source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/fastapi_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/cors.py`:

- Line 58: `allow_headers = sorted(SAFELISTED_HEADERS | set(allow_headers))`
  Headers are sorted while still in their original case

- Line 60: `preflight_headers["Access-Control-Allow-Headers"] = ", ".join(allow_headers)`
  The original-case headers are put into the preflight response

- Line 67: `self.allow_headers = [h.lower() for h in allow_headers]`
  Headers are lowercased AFTER sorting

The bug occurs because Python's `sorted()` function is case-sensitive (uppercase letters sort before lowercase in ASCII order). When 'A' is provided, it sorts before 'accept', but when 'a' is provided, it sorts after 'content-type'.

### Impact

This bug causes:
1. Inconsistent internal state (`self.allow_headers`) based on input case
2. Different CORS preflight responses for semantically identical configurations
3. Potential confusion for API consumers who might get different responses based on header casing
