DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Starlette Documentation Review:

The official Starlette documentation for CORSMiddleware does NOT specify:
- Whether allow_headers should be sorted
- Whether duplicates should be removed
- How case sensitivity should be handled

The documentation only states that allow_headers is "A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin requests" with no additional implementation details.

## HTTP Standards Review:

### RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics):
- **HTTP header field names are case-insensitive** according to the specification
- This means 'Content-Type', 'content-type', and 'CONTENT-TYPE' should all be treated as equivalent

### CORS Specification:
- The CORS specification (WHATWG Fetch) does not mandate sorting or specific formatting of the Access-Control-Allow-Headers value
- It only requires a comma-separated list of header names

## Code Intent Analysis:

The code clearly shows intent to:
1. **Deduplicate headers** - Uses `set()` on line 58
2. **Sort headers** - Uses `sorted()` on line 58
3. **Normalize to lowercase** - Uses `.lower()` on line 67

These operations demonstrate clear intent by the developers, but they are performed in the wrong order.

## Conclusion:

While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise deduplication or sorting, the code's implementation clearly attempts to do both. The bug violates the code's own internal consistency and intent. Since HTTP headers are case-insensitive by specification, having duplicate headers that differ only in case (like 'q' and 'q' from 'Q' and 'q') is incorrect behavior that violates HTTP standards.
