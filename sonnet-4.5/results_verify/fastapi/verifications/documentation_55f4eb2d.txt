DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR SECURITYSCOPES CLASS

After reviewing the FastAPI source code and relevant documentation:

1. **FastAPI Documentation on SecurityScopes:**
   - The SecurityScopes class is documented in the FastAPI advanced security documentation
   - It's used to handle OAuth2 scopes in dependency injection
   - The class has a `scopes` attribute (list of strings) and a `scope_str` property
   - The docstring states that `scope_str` contains "All the scopes required by all the dependencies in a single string separated by spaces, as defined in the OAuth2 specification"
   - The parameter `scopes` is documented as "This will be filled by FastAPI" - indicating it's meant to be populated by the framework internally
   - There is NO documentation about input validation requirements or handling of whitespace/empty strings

2. **OAuth2 Specification (RFC 6749):**
   - Section 3.3 defines scopes as "a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings"
   - The allowed characters for scope strings are: %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E (printable ASCII excluding space and some special characters)
   - This means spaces, tabs, newlines, and other whitespace characters are NOT valid within a scope string itself
   - Multiple scopes are separated by spaces
   - The specification does not explicitly address empty or whitespace-only scopes, but the character set definition implicitly excludes them

3. **Code Behavior in Related Classes:**
   - OAuth2PasswordRequestForm uses `scope.split()` on line 147 to parse scopes from form data
   - The `.split()` method automatically filters out whitespace-only strings
   - This suggests the expected behavior is that whitespace should not be preserved as individual scopes

4. **Key Observations:**
   - The SecurityScopes class accepts ANY list of strings without validation
   - The implementation uses simple string joining with spaces: `" ".join(self.scopes)`
   - There's a disconnect between what OAuth2 spec allows and what the class accepts
   - The documentation doesn't specify behavior for invalid inputs like whitespace-only strings
