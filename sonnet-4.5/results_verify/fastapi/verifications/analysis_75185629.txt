Bug Report Triage Analysis
===========================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible triage category:

## INVALID
Arguments against INVALID:
- The bug is real and reproducible
- Having duplicate headers in a list is objectively incorrect behavior
- HTTP headers are case-insensitive by specification, so "accept" and "Accept" should be treated as the same header
- The code clearly produces duplicates which violates reasonable expectations

Arguments for INVALID:
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise unique headers in allow_headers
- The duplicate doesn't cause the middleware to crash or fail

Verdict: NOT INVALID - The bug is real and represents incorrect behavior.

## WONTFIX
Arguments for WONTFIX:
- The duplicate headers don't cause the middleware to crash
- The CORS functionality still works despite the duplicates
- This is an edge case that may not affect many users
- The performance impact is minimal

Arguments against WONTFIX:
- This violates the principle of least surprise
- It creates unnecessary inefficiencies
- It's a clear logic error in the implementation
- The fix is straightforward and low-risk
- Other projects have fixed similar issues (based on search results)

Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - While the impact is limited, this is a clear bug that should be fixed.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation doesn't specify how case-insensitive headers should be handled
- Could document that duplicates may occur with certain inputs

Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- This is clearly unintended behavior, not a documentation issue
- Documenting this as expected behavior would be confusing
- The code logic shows this is a bug, not a feature

Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - This is a code bug, not a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST
Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could be framed as "add case-insensitive deduplication for headers"
- The current code doesn't have this capability

Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Headers should be deduplicated by default per HTTP standards
- The current behavior is a bug, not a missing feature

Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing a bug, not adding a feature.

## BUG
Arguments for BUG:
- Clear logic error in the code: headers are added to a set with original casing, then lowercased, creating duplicates
- Violates HTTP specification principle that headers are case-insensitive
- Creates unnecessary duplicates in a list that should contain unique values
- The fix is straightforward and the bug report includes a working solution
- Other similar projects have treated this as a bug worth fixing
- The behavior is unexpected and counterintuitive
- While it doesn't break functionality completely, it represents incorrect implementation

Arguments against BUG:
- The middleware still functions despite the duplicates
- Not explicitly documented as incorrect behavior

Verdict: THIS IS A BUG - Clear implementation error that should be fixed.

## Final Assessment

This is a valid BUG report. The CORSMiddleware incorrectly handles headers that differ only in case from the safelisted headers, resulting in duplicate entries in the allow_headers list. This violates the HTTP specification's principle of case-insensitive headers and represents a clear logic error in the implementation. The bug should be fixed using the approach suggested in the report or a similar solution that ensures case-insensitive deduplication.
