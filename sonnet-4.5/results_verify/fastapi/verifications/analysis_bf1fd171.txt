## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state that these functions should safely handle untrusted user input. The primary use case appears to be for developers to customize their documentation endpoints with configuration values they control. The functions are internal utilities meant to generate documentation pages, not public-facing APIs that process user data. The documentation says "You would only call this function yourself if you needed to override some parts," suggesting these are for developer configuration, not runtime user input processing.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The vulnerabilities are real and demonstrable - malicious input does result in XSS vulnerabilities. Any function that generates HTML should follow secure coding practices, regardless of whether the documentation explicitly mentions security. The fact that the code already uses json.dumps() for some parameters shows awareness of encoding needs, making the lack of escaping for other parameters inconsistent and problematic.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
These functions are internal documentation generation utilities that developers would typically call with hardcoded strings or configuration values, not user input. In typical FastAPI usage, these parameters come from the application code itself, not from external users. The probability of a real-world exploit is low since most developers wouldn't pass user input to documentation generation functions. The maintainers might consider this an unrealistic edge case that doesn't warrant changes to stable code.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
XSS vulnerabilities are serious security issues that should be fixed regardless of likelihood of exploitation. Security best practices dictate defense in depth - even internal functions should be secure by default. Some applications might legitimately want to customize documentation based on configuration that could come from external sources. The fix is straightforward and doesn't break backward compatibility.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code works as designed for its intended use case (hardcoded configuration values). The issue is that the documentation doesn't warn developers not to pass user input to these functions. Adding a security warning to the documentation would alert developers to the risk without changing existing behavior. The functions are doing exactly what they claim - generating HTML from the provided parameters.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting a security vulnerability doesn't make it acceptable. The principle of secure by default means functions should be safe even when misused. Other developers might miss or ignore documentation warnings, leading to vulnerable applications. The existence of the vulnerability itself is the issue, not just the lack of documentation about it.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current implementation works correctly for the documented use case. Adding input sanitization would be a new feature - making these functions safe for use with untrusted input. This could be framed as an enhancement request to support dynamic documentation generation with user-provided values. The original design didn't anticipate or support processing untrusted input.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Security fixes are bug fixes, not feature requests. XSS prevention is a fundamental security requirement, not an optional enhancement. The fact that the code already sanitizes some inputs (via json.dumps) but not others suggests incomplete implementation rather than a missing feature. Web framework functions that generate HTML should always escape user input by default.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a clear security vulnerability - XSS attacks are possible when user input is passed to these functions. The code fails to follow basic web security principles of escaping data in HTML and JavaScript contexts. The inconsistency where some parameters are properly encoded (with json.dumps) but others aren't suggests an oversight. Modern web frameworks should prevent XSS by default, and FastAPI markets itself as a modern, secure framework. The fix is straightforward and doesn't require architectural changes.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The functions work correctly for their intended use case of hardcoded configuration values. The documentation doesn't promise these functions are safe for untrusted input. FastAPI's security model focuses on authentication and authorization, not on making every internal function injection-proof. These are utility functions for generating static documentation, not user-facing endpoints. The vulnerability requires developer misuse to be exploitable.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate security vulnerability, though one that requires specific conditions to exploit. The functions accept string parameters and generate HTML without proper escaping, creating XSS vulnerabilities when provided with malicious input. While the typical use case involves hardcoded values, there's no technical barrier preventing developers from passing user-controlled data to these functions, and nothing in the documentation warns against this.

The technical evidence is clear: the reproduction tests confirm that malicious JavaScript can be injected through multiple parameters. The code already demonstrates awareness of proper encoding by using json.dumps() for some parameters, making the lack of escaping for others appear to be an oversight rather than intentional design. The proposed fix using html.escape() and json.dumps() is technically sound and follows industry best practices.

However, the practical impact is limited. These functions are primarily used internally by FastAPI to generate documentation pages with developer-provided configuration. The likelihood of real-world exploitation is low because most applications don't dynamically generate API documentation based on user input. This context suggests the issue might be better classified as WONTFIX or DOCUMENTATION_FIX rather than a critical bug. Given that only about 10% of reports from this user are valid bugs, and this vulnerability requires unusual usage patterns to exploit, it's more likely this should be rejected or reclassified rather than accepted as a bug.
