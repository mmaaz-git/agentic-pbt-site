## Documentation Analysis for get_flat_dependant()

### Official Documentation Status:

1. **Function Documentation**: The get_flat_dependant() function is an internal utility function in FastAPI and is NOT publicly documented in the official FastAPI documentation.

2. **Source Code Location**: Found in `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py` as an internal implementation detail.

3. **Function Purpose**: Based on GitHub source code analysis:
   - Recursively flattens dependency trees
   - Collects and combines parameters from sub-dependencies
   - Aggregates path, query, header, cookie, and body parameters

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **No Circular Dependency Documentation**:
   - The official FastAPI documentation does not mention circular dependencies in the context of Dependant objects
   - The dependencies tutorial discusses hierarchical trees but not cycles
   - No explicit warning about avoiding circular dependencies

2. **Internal vs Public API**:
   - get_flat_dependant() is not part of the public API
   - It's an internal utility function used by FastAPI's dependency injection system
   - End users typically don't directly interact with this function

3. **Related Documentation**:
   - The FastAPI documentation discusses dependency injection patterns
   - It mentions that dependencies can have sub-dependencies creating "hierarchical trees"
   - No mention of what happens with circular references

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The function has a `skip_repeats` parameter (default False)
   - Has a `visited` list to track processed dependencies
   - When skip_repeats=True, it checks cache_keys to avoid re-processing

### Documentation Gaps:

1. Since this is an internal function, the lack of public documentation is expected
2. However, the function is used internally to process user-defined dependencies
3. Users can create circular dependencies through the public API (Depends())
4. There's no documentation warning users about circular dependency issues

### Conclusion:

The documentation does not specify how circular dependencies should be handled. Since users can create circular dependency structures through the public API that get processed by this internal function, and there's no documented warning against circular dependencies, the current behavior (RecursionError) represents an unhandled edge case rather than documented expected behavior.
