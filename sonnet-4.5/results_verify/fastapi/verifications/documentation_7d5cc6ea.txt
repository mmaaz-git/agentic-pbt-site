## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The function `is_body_allowed_for_status_code` has minimal documentation:
- Type signature: `(status_code: Union[int, str, None]) -> bool`
- No docstring provided
- Only a comment referencing OpenAPI specification for patterned fields

### Key Findings:

1. **Type Contract**: The function explicitly declares it accepts `Union[int, str, None]`, indicating it should handle:
   - Integer status codes (e.g., 200, 404)
   - String status codes (any string type)
   - None values

2. **OpenAPI Context**: The comment references OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification patterned fields, which defines:
   - Special patterns: "default", "1XX", "2XX", "3XX", "4XX", "5XX"
   - These are used as wildcards for status code ranges in OpenAPI responses

3. **Usage Context in FastAPI**:
   - The function is used throughout FastAPI in routing and OpenAPI generation
   - In `APIRoute.__init__`, the `responses` parameter is typed as `Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]]`
   - This confirms that FastAPI explicitly allows string status codes in responses
   - The function is called with `additional_status_code` from user-provided `responses` dict

4. **No Documentation Restrictions**:
   - There is NO documentation stating that only numeric strings are allowed
   - There is NO documentation warning about ValueError exceptions
   - The type signature promises to accept any string, not just numeric ones

5. **Expected Behavior Based on Context**:
   - The function determines if HTTP response bodies are allowed for given status codes
   - Per HTTP standards, certain status codes (204, 205, 304, and 1xx codes) should not have bodies
   - The function should return a boolean for ANY input matching its type signature

### Conclusion:
The documentation (via type hints) promises the function accepts any string, but the implementation violates this contract by crashing on non-numeric strings. This is not an issue of unclear documentation - the type signature IS the documentation, and it explicitly allows all strings.
