## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully reproduced the bug using the provided test cases.

### Test Case 1: Direct Reproduction
Using the provided reproduction code with username="admin" and password="Pässwörd123":
- **Result**: The code raises an HTTPException with status 401 and message "Invalid authentication credentials"
- **Underlying cause**: A UnicodeDecodeError occurs when trying to decode the base64-decoded bytes as ASCII
- **Error location**: `/fastapi/security/http.py`, line 211

### Test Case 2: Specific Example
Using username="user" and password="pÄssw0rd" (containing German umlaut Ä):
- **Result**: Failed with HTTPException 401: "Invalid authentication credentials"
- **Behavior**: The code catches the UnicodeDecodeError and re-raises it as an HTTPException, hiding the actual encoding issue

### Technical Details
1. The base64 encoding of UTF-8 credentials works correctly
2. The base64 decoding produces correct bytes
3. The failure occurs when attempting to decode these bytes as ASCII
4. Any character with code point > 127 (non-ASCII) triggers the error
5. The error is caught and re-raised as a generic authentication failure

### Verification of Bug Report Claims
The bug report's technical claims are accurate:
- The code does fail on line 211 with `.decode("ascii")`
- UTF-8 characters in usernames or passwords cause a UnicodeDecodeError
- The error is masked as an authentication failure rather than an encoding issue
- The proposed fix of changing to `.decode("utf-8")` would resolve the issue

### Real-World Impact Confirmation
The bug affects:
- Users with non-ASCII characters in names (José, Müller, 王, etc.)
- Passwords containing international characters
- Any authentication system serving non-English speaking users
- Systems that need to comply with modern internationalization standards
