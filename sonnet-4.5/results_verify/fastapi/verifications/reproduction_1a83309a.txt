REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in FastAPI version 0.115.12.

## Test Results

1. **Basic Reproduction Script**
   - Whitespace-only strings ("   ", "\t\r\n", "\x85") are returned as-is instead of being rejected
   - Empty strings ("") and None values are correctly rejected (return None)
   - This creates inconsistent behavior between empty and whitespace-only strings

2. **Hypothesis Property-Based Tests**
   - Both basic whitespace test and Unicode whitespace test fail as expected
   - The tests correctly identify that whitespace-only strings are not rejected
   - Tests confirm the bug exists for all whitespace characters, including Unicode whitespace

3. **Auto-Error Behavior**
   - With auto_error=True: Whitespace strings do NOT raise exceptions (they should)
   - With auto_error=True: Empty strings and None correctly raise HTTP 403 exceptions
   - With auto_error=False: Whitespace strings are returned as-is (should return None)
   - With auto_error=False: Empty strings and None correctly return None

## Code Analysis

The bug is located in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/fastapi/security/api_key.py` at line 14:

```python
def check_api_key(api_key: Optional[str], auto_error: bool) -> Optional[str]:
    if not api_key:  # <- BUG: This only checks truthiness
        if auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        return None
    return api_key
```

The problem is that `if not api_key:` uses Python's truthiness check:
- Empty string "" evaluates to False (correctly rejected)
- None evaluates to False (correctly rejected)
- Whitespace strings like "   " evaluate to True (incorrectly accepted)

## Impact

This bug affects all three API key authentication classes:
- APIKeyQuery (query parameter authentication)
- APIKeyHeader (header authentication)
- APIKeyCookie (cookie authentication)

All three classes inherit from APIKeyBase and use the flawed check_api_key method.

## Security Implications

The bug creates a security vulnerability where authentication can potentially be bypassed using whitespace-only API keys. While these keys would likely not match any stored valid keys in a real application, the inconsistent validation could lead to:

1. Confusion in security audits
2. Potential bypass scenarios if downstream code assumes validated keys are non-whitespace
3. Inconsistent behavior between empty and whitespace strings
4. Log analysis difficulties when whitespace keys are involved

The bug report's proposed fix is correct and would resolve the issue by checking both for empty strings and whitespace-only strings.
