## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR**:
- There IS an inconsistency between `' '.join()` and `.split()` operations
- The round-trip property fails for certain inputs
- Data is silently lost when scopes contain Unicode whitespace
- The code behavior is inconsistent within FastAPI itself

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- OAuth2 RFC 6749 explicitly forbids whitespace in scope names
- The test uses invalid scope names per the spec
- This is an edge case with invalid input

**Verdict**: Partially valid - there is an internal inconsistency, but with invalid input.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR**:
- The OAuth2 RFC 6749 explicitly states scope tokens cannot contain whitespace
- The test case uses `'\x85'` which is NOT a valid scope name
- FastAPI is not obligated to handle RFC-violating inputs correctly
- The bug only occurs with inputs that violate the OAuth2 specification

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- FastAPI doesn't validate scope names, implicitly accepting any string
- The inconsistency exists regardless of RFC compliance
- Silent data loss is problematic even for invalid input

**Verdict**: Strong case - the test uses invalid input per OAuth2 spec.

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR**:
- Extremely obscure edge case (Unicode whitespace in scope names)
- Would never happen with RFC-compliant OAuth2 implementations
- The "fix" might mask the real issue (invalid scope names)

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- Easy to fix the inconsistency
- Silent data loss could be security-relevant

**Verdict**: Moderate case - very edge case but easy to fix.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR**:
- Could be reframed as "Add validation for RFC-compliant scope names"
- The current permissive behavior might be intentional flexibility

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- The report is about a bug, not requesting new functionality
- The inconsistency is clearly unintended behavior

**Verdict**: Weak case - this is about fixing existing behavior, not adding features.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR**:
- FastAPI should document that it accepts non-RFC-compliant scope names
- The permissive behavior differs from OAuth2 specification
- Users might expect RFC validation that doesn't exist

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- The core issue is a code inconsistency, not documentation
- The bug causes actual data loss, not just confusion

**Verdict**: Weak case - while docs could be clearer, there's a real code bug.

## Final Assessment

This bug report describes behavior with **invalid input** according to OAuth2 RFC 6749. The specification explicitly forbids any whitespace characters in scope names (only allows %x21, %x23-5B, %x5D-7E). The test case using `'\x85'` (NEL) as a scope name violates the RFC.

While there IS an inconsistency in FastAPI's code (using `.split()` without arguments vs `' '.join()`), this inconsistency only manifests with RFC-violating input. FastAPI's real issue is that it doesn't validate scope names at all, but that's a separate concern.

The most appropriate categorization is **INVALID** because:
1. The test uses scope names that violate OAuth2 RFC 6749
2. FastAPI is not required to handle RFC-violating inputs correctly
3. The "bug" only occurs with invalid input that should never exist in a compliant OAuth2 implementation
