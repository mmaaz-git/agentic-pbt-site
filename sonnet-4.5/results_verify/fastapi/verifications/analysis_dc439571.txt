ANALYSIS OF BUG REPORT FOR fastapi.dependencies.utils.get_path_param_names

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report is testing behavior that is completely outside the intended use case of the function. Path parameter names in FastAPI must map to Python function parameters, and Python identifiers cannot contain any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, or newlines). The function is never expected to handle these cases correctly because they would never work in practice. The test is essentially asserting that the function should handle invalid input in a specific way, when the documentation never specifies what should happen with invalid input. The current behavior (inconsistent as it may be) doesn't matter because none of these inputs would ever be valid in a real FastAPI application.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function does exhibit inconsistent behavior - it extracts spaces and tabs but not newlines, which is a technical inconsistency in the regex pattern. The property-based test correctly identifies this inconsistency. From a purely technical standpoint, the function's behavior is not uniform across different types of whitespace characters.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case that would never occur in real-world usage. Path parameters with whitespace characters cannot be used in FastAPI because they cannot map to valid Python function parameters. The inconsistency has zero practical impact - whether the function extracts these invalid names or not, the application would fail at a later stage. Fixing this would add no value to users and might even mask real problems by making invalid path definitions appear to work longer before failing. The current inconsistent behavior, while technically imperfect, has no negative consequences for any valid use case.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency could be seen as a code quality issue. Having predictable, consistent behavior even for edge cases can make code easier to reason about. The fix is trivial (changing the regex pattern) and would make the function's behavior more consistent.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify what characters are valid in path parameter names. It doesn't explicitly state that path parameters must be valid Python identifiers. Adding documentation to clarify that path parameter names must follow Python identifier rules would prevent confusion. The function could have a docstring explaining its purpose and limitations.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The need for valid Python identifiers is implicit and obvious from how FastAPI works - path parameters map directly to function parameters. The function is an internal utility, not part of the public API, so detailed documentation may not be necessary. The examples in the documentation universally use valid Python identifiers, which implicitly communicates the requirement.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that the function should validate path parameter names and raise an error when they contain invalid characters for Python identifiers. This would provide better error messages to users who accidentally use invalid characters. Adding validation would be a new feature that improves error handling.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report isn't asking for new functionality or validation. It's claiming the current regex behavior is wrong. The report specifically provides a "fix" to make extraction consistent, not to add validation. This is framed as a bug, not a feature request.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There is a technical inconsistency in the function's behavior. The regex pattern `{(.*?)}` doesn't match newlines while it does match other whitespace. The property-based test correctly identifies this inconsistency. The proposed fix would make the behavior uniform and predictable.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The inconsistency occurs entirely in the realm of invalid inputs that should never occur. The function works correctly for all valid use cases (path parameters with valid Python identifiers). The current behavior, while inconsistent, doesn't cause any actual problems because path parameters with any whitespace would fail regardless. This is testing undefined behavior - the function was never designed or documented to handle whitespace in parameter names.

## Overall Consideration
This bug report identifies a real technical inconsistency in the regex pattern used by `get_path_param_names`, where spaces and tabs are extracted but newlines are not. However, this inconsistency exists entirely in the realm of invalid inputs that would never work in FastAPI anyway, since path parameters must map to Python function parameters, and Python identifiers cannot contain any whitespace characters.

The function is an internal utility that was clearly designed to extract valid parameter names from path templates. It was never intended to handle or validate edge cases with whitespace. The current inconsistent behavior has zero practical impact because whether these invalid names are extracted or not, they would cause failures when FastAPI tries to map them to function parameters. The property-based test is technically correct but practically meaningless.

Given that this is an internal utility function with no documentation, testing undefined behavior that would never occur in valid usage, and the "fix" would provide no value to any real user, this should be closed as INVALID. The test is asserting specific behavior for invalid inputs that were never specified to work in any particular way.
