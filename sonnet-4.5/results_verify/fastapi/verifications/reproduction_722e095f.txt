## Bug Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the FastAPI dependencies module. The bug occurs when creating circular dependencies between Dependant objects.

### Test Results:

1. **Property-Based Test**: FAILED with RecursionError
   - Created two Dependant objects (dep1 and dep2) where dep1 depends on dep2 and dep2 depends on dep1
   - The test crashed with `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`
   - Stack trace shows infinite recursion in get_flat_dependant() function

2. **Direct Reproduction Code**: FAILED with RecursionError
   - Same setup as above, directly calling get_flat_dependant(dep1)
   - Resulted in identical RecursionError

3. **Additional Testing with skip_repeats=True**: PASSED
   - When using get_flat_dependant(dep1, skip_repeats=True), the function completes successfully
   - This works because the two lambda functions have different cache_keys
   - The skip_repeats mechanism checks if sub_dependant.cache_key is in visited list

### Analysis of the Code:

Looking at the actual implementation in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/fastapi/dependencies/utils.py`:

- The function maintains a `visited` list to track processed cache_keys
- When `skip_repeats=True`, it skips dependencies whose cache_key is already in visited
- However, when `skip_repeats=False` (default), there is no protection against circular references
- The function will recurse infinitely when encountering circular dependencies

### Conclusion:

The bug is confirmed. The get_flat_dependant() function does not handle circular dependencies when skip_repeats=False (the default), leading to RecursionError. The function lacks a mechanism to detect and break circular reference cycles during recursion.
