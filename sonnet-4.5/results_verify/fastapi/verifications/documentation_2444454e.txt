## Documentation Analysis

### HTTP Standards (RFC 7230)

RFC 7230 Section 3.2 explicitly states:
"Each header field consists of a **case-insensitive field name** followed by a colon (":"), optional leading whitespace, the field value, and optional trailing whitespace."

This is a fundamental HTTP specification requirement - header field names MUST be treated case-insensitively.

### Starlette/FastAPI Documentation

The official Starlette documentation for CORSMiddleware:
- Does not explicitly mention case sensitivity handling for headers
- States that `allow_headers` parameter accepts a list of headers to allow
- Notes that "Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language and Content-Type headers are always allowed"
- Does not specify that headers should be treated differently based on case

### CORS Specifications

While the CORS specifications (Fetch Standard and W3C) don't explicitly detail case sensitivity for the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header value, they inherit from HTTP standards which mandate case-insensitive header field names.

### Expected Behavior Based on Standards

Given the HTTP specification's clear requirement for case-insensitive header field names, the expected behavior is:
1. `allow_headers=['A']` and `allow_headers=['a']` should produce identical results
2. The middleware should treat 'A', 'a', and any other case variation as the same header
3. The internal state and output should be consistent regardless of input case

### Documentation Gap

The Starlette documentation does not explicitly state that headers are case-insensitive, but this is implied by HTTP standards compliance. A reasonable developer would expect HTTP middleware to follow HTTP standards, particularly RFC 7230's requirement for case-insensitive header field names.
