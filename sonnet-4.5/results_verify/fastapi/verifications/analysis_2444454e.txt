## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report) - STRONG CASE
**Why this should be tagged as BUG:**
1. **Violates HTTP Standards**: RFC 7230 explicitly requires header field names to be case-insensitive. The current implementation treats 'A' and 'a' differently, directly violating this standard.
2. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The same logical input (a header name) produces different outputs based solely on case, causing unpredictable behavior.
3. **Incorrect Implementation**: The code sorts headers before lowercasing them (line 58), then lowercases for storage (line 67). This is clearly a logic error - headers should be normalized before sorting.
4. **Real-World Impact**: This could break CORS configurations where developers expect standard HTTP case-insensitive behavior.
5. **Clear Fix Available**: The bug report provides a reasonable fix that would make the behavior correct.

### INVALID - WEAK CASE
**Why it might be considered INVALID:**
- None. This is clearly a bug that violates HTTP standards.

### WONTFIX - WEAK CASE
**Why it might be considered WONTFIX:**
1. The order of headers in the response might be considered cosmetic only
2. Some might argue the middleware "works" even with this inconsistency
However, these arguments are weak because HTTP standard compliance is not optional.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - WEAK CASE
**Why it might be considered DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The Starlette documentation doesn't explicitly mention case-insensitive handling
2. Could document this as a "known quirk"
However, this would be inappropriate as it's a standards violation, not a documentation issue.

### FEATURE_REQUEST - WEAK CASE
**Why it might be considered FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not a feature request. The expected behavior (case-insensitive headers) is mandated by HTTP standards, not a new feature.

### Conclusion
This is unquestionably a **BUG**. The implementation violates RFC 7230's requirement that HTTP header field names be case-insensitive. The middleware produces different internal states and response headers based on the case of input headers, which is incorrect behavior for any HTTP-compliant implementation. The bug has a clear root cause (sorting before normalizing case) and a straightforward fix.
