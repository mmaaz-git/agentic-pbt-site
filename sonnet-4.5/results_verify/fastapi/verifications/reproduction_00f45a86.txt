## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Steps Performed

1. **Hypothesis Test Execution**:
   - Ran the property-based test from the bug report
   - Test failed with input `['\x1f']` (different from report's `['\x85']`, but same issue)
   - The test correctly identifies the round-trip failure

2. **Specific Example Reproduction**:
   - Executed the exact code from the bug report with `scopes_list = ['\x85']`
   - Confirmed the bug:
     - Input: `['\x85']`
     - scope_str: `'\x85'`
     - Reconstructed via split(): `[]` (empty list)
   - The scope is completely lost during round-trip

3. **Extended Testing**:
   - Tested multiple Unicode whitespace characters
   - All Unicode whitespace characters cause the same issue:
     - `'\x85'` (NEL - Next Line)
     - `'\xa0'` (NBSP - Non-breaking space)
     - `'\u2000'` (En Quad)
     - `'\u2028'` (Line separator)
     - `'\u2029'` (Paragraph separator)
   - Normal ASCII text scopes work correctly

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug occurs due to inconsistent string operations:

1. **SecurityScopes.scope_str** (line 638): Uses `" ".join(self.scopes)`
   - Joins with regular space character (U+0020)

2. **OAuth2PasswordRequestForm.__init__** (line 147): Uses `scope.split()`
   - Splits on ALL Unicode whitespace when no argument provided

This inconsistency means:
- A scope containing Unicode whitespace like `'\x85'` becomes the scope_str `'\x85'`
- When `'\x85'.split()` is called, Python treats `'\x85'` as whitespace and returns `[]`
- The scope is silently lost

### Impact

The bug causes silent data loss when:
1. A scope name contains Unicode whitespace characters
2. The scope string is round-tripped through join/split operations
3. This could lead to security issues where expected scopes are missing

### Verification

The bug is consistently reproducible and the report's analysis is accurate.
