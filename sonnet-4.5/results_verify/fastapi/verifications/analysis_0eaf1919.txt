## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report assumes that `self.allow_headers` should be sorted, but there is no documentation or functional requirement for this internal storage to be sorted. The attribute is only used for membership testing (line 129) where order is completely irrelevant. The sorting on line 58 is specifically for generating the HTTP response header, not for internal storage. The code works correctly as designed - the internal representation doesn't need to be sorted.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code does explicitly sort the headers on line 58, and a developer might reasonably expect that sorting to be preserved. The variable name `allow_headers` is reused, which could suggest the sorted order should be maintained throughout.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a trivial internal implementation detail with zero functional impact. The `self.allow_headers` list is never exposed to users, never iterated in order, and only used for membership checks where order doesn't matter. The actual CORS functionality works perfectly. Fixing this would add complexity (sorting after lowercasing) for no practical benefit. The performance impact of an unsorted list for membership testing is negligible.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
If the code explicitly sorts headers, maintaining that sort order throughout might be considered good practice. Some developers might rely on inspecting the internal state for debugging purposes.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current code behavior is reasonable (sorting for HTTP response, lowercase for validation), but this behavior is not documented. Adding documentation to clarify that internal storage order is not guaranteed would prevent confusion. The sorting is an implementation detail for response formatting, not a guarantee about internal state.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The internal attribute `self.allow_headers` is not part of the public API and users shouldn't be accessing it directly. Internal implementation details typically don't need documentation. The public behavior (CORS validation and responses) works correctly as documented.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
If users want sorted internal storage for debugging or inspection purposes, this could be considered a new feature. The current code doesn't support this, and adding it would be an enhancement rather than fixing broken functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report isn't asking for new functionality but claiming existing code is broken. The reporter believes this is a bug based on their interpretation of the existing sort operation.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code explicitly sorts headers on line 58, suggesting intent to maintain order. The lowercasing on line 67 breaks this ordering, which could be seen as violating the original intent. The comment in the bug report correctly identifies that the sort order is lost due to lowercasing happening after sorting.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There is no functional issue - CORS works correctly, headers are validated properly, and responses include the correct sorted headers. The internal storage order is an implementation detail with no user-facing impact. The sorting on line 58 serves its purpose (generating the response header) before the lowercasing occurs. No documentation promises sorted internal storage.

## Overall Consideration

The bug report is technically correct that `self.allow_headers` ends up unsorted after lowercasing, but this is analyzing an internal implementation detail with zero functional impact. The sorting on line 58 serves a specific purpose - creating the "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" response header value on line 60, which happens before the lowercasing. The lowercased version is stored for efficient case-insensitive header validation on line 129, where order is completely irrelevant.

The reporter's proposed fix would actually make the code worse by combining the sorting and lowercasing into a single operation on line 67, which would mean the response header on line 60 would need to be generated differently. The current separation of concerns (sorted for response, lowercased for validation) is actually good design.

Most importantly, there is no user-facing issue here. The middleware correctly validates headers, correctly generates responses, and behaves exactly as documented. The internal storage order of `self.allow_headers` is not part of any API contract, and the code never relies on it being sorted. This is a case of someone using property-based testing to find technical inconsistencies in internal state that have no practical significance.

Given that this is about internal state ordering with no functional impact, no documentation promises about internal ordering, and the current design actually makes sense (sort for response, lowercase for validation), this should be closed as INVALID.
