Documentation Analysis
======================

I reviewed multiple documentation sources to understand the expected behavior:

1. Starlette Documentation (https://www.starlette.io/middleware/#corsmiddleware):
   - States that certain headers are "always allowed": Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language, Content-Type
   - Does NOT specify whether headers should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive
   - Does NOT specify how duplicate headers should be handled
   - Does NOT explicitly state that the allow_headers list should be unique

2. HTTP Specification and Standards:
   - According to HTTP standards, header field names are case-insensitive (RFC 7230, Section 3.2)
   - Headers should be compared case-insensitively
   - The CORS specification follows HTTP standards for header case-insensitivity

3. Industry Best Practices:
   - Search results confirm HTTP headers should be case-insensitive
   - Multiple bug reports from other projects (Quarkus, http-server) mention similar issues with case-sensitive header handling
   - Common consensus is that CORS header names should be treated case-insensitively

4. Documentation Gaps:
   - Neither Starlette nor FastAPI documentation explicitly states:
     * Whether allow_headers should contain unique values
     * How case variations of the same header should be handled
     * The expected behavior when user provides headers that match safelisted headers (with different casing)

5. Implicit Expectations:
   - While not explicitly documented, reasonable expectations would be:
     * A list of allowed headers should not contain duplicates
     * Headers that differ only in case should be treated as the same header (per HTTP standards)
     * The middleware should handle case-insensitive deduplication internally

Conclusion: The documentation does not explicitly specify the behavior for this edge case. However, based on HTTP standards and the principle that headers are case-insensitive, having duplicate headers in the allow_headers list is unexpected behavior and likely unintentional.
