## Documentation Analysis

### FastAPI Documentation

The FastAPI documentation for HTTPBasic authentication does not specify any character encoding requirements or limitations. The documentation shows basic usage examples but doesn't mention:
- What character encodings are supported
- Whether UTF-8 credentials are allowed
- Any limitations on character sets for usernames or passwords

The absence of documentation about encoding suggests that users would reasonably expect standard-compliant behavior.

### RFC 7617 Specification

RFC 7617 ("The 'Basic' HTTP Authentication Scheme") is the authoritative specification for HTTP Basic authentication. Key findings:

1. **Default Encoding**: Section 2 states: "For backwards compatibility reasons, this specification continues to leave the default encoding undefined, as long as it is compatible with US-ASCII." However, it does NOT mandate ASCII-only support.

2. **UTF-8 Support**: Section 2.1 explicitly defines UTF-8 as the only allowed value for the 'charset' parameter when servers want to indicate UTF-8 support.

3. **Character Support Requirements**:
   - For user-id: "recipients MUST support all characters defined in the 'UsernameCasePreserved' profile" (Section 2.1)
   - For password: "recipients MUST support all characters defined in the 'OpaqueString' profile" (Section 2.1)

   These profiles include Unicode characters beyond ASCII.

4. **Industry Practice**: The RFC acknowledges that "In practice, most implementations chose either a locale-specific encoding such as ISO-8859-1, or UTF-8."

5. **Migration Path**: The RFC describes servers supporting UTF-8 by:
   - Advertising charset="UTF-8" in challenges
   - Attempting UTF-8 decoding first
   - Optionally falling back to legacy encodings

### Conclusion

While RFC 7617 doesn't mandate UTF-8 as the default encoding, it clearly expects implementations to support UTF-8 when indicated and describes UTF-8 as a common choice in practice. The current FastAPI implementation using only ASCII decoding is more restrictive than what the RFC describes as common practice and prevents the use of international characters that the RFC profiles explicitly require support for.
