BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect)
-----------------------------------
Arguments against INVALID:
- The bug is reproducible and confirmed through testing
- The behavior contradicts RFC 3986 URL normalization principles
- Port 443 is NOT the default port for HTTP scheme
- The code demonstrably drops port 443 from HTTP URLs incorrectly

Arguments for INVALID:
- None found. The bug report is technically accurate.

Verdict: NOT INVALID - The bug is real and correctly described.

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
-----------------------------------
Arguments for WONTFIX:
- Using HTTP on port 443 is non-standard and uncommon
- Most real-world applications don't use this configuration
- The impact is limited to edge cases

Arguments against WONTFIX:
- This is a legitimate configuration that some systems may use
- Port flexibility is important for development, testing, and proxy configurations
- The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality
- Violates RFC standards which should be respected

Verdict: Unlikely WONTFIX - While edge case, it's a standards violation with a simple fix.

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
--------------------------------------------
Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could argue that preserving non-standard ports during redirects is a new feature

Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is not requesting new functionality
- The middleware already handles port preservation for other non-standard ports (e.g., 8080)
- The issue is inconsistent behavior, not missing functionality
- RFC 3986 compliance should be expected, not a feature

Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing incorrect existing behavior.

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
------------------------------------------
Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The behavior is completely undocumented
- Could document that "port 443 is always dropped regardless of scheme"
- Users might accept this if it were documented

Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The behavior violates RFC standards
- Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it correct
- The code logic appears to be a mistake, not intentional design
- Other ports are handled correctly, showing inconsistency

Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code behavior is wrong, not just undocumented.

5. BUG (Valid bug report)
-------------------------
Arguments for BUG:
- Violates RFC 3986 URL normalization principles
- Inconsistent port handling (correctly preserves 8080 but not 443 for HTTP)
- The current logic conflates HTTP and HTTPS default ports
- Simple logic error: assumes port 443 can be dropped for HTTP when it shouldn't
- The suggested fix correctly addresses the issue
- Test cases properly demonstrate the problem
- Real-world impact for development, testing, and proxy scenarios

Arguments against BUG:
- Edge case that rarely occurs in production
- Has existed without major complaints (possibly)

Verdict: STRONG CASE FOR BUG - Clear logic error with standards violation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT
================

This is a BUG. The middleware incorrectly assumes that port 443 can be dropped from HTTP URLs when redirecting to HTTPS, violating RFC 3986 principles. The correct behavior is to only drop a port when it matches the default for the CURRENT scheme (not the target scheme).

Key evidence:
1. RFC 3986 states ports should only be omitted when they match the scheme's default
2. Port 443 is NOT the default for HTTP (port 80 is)
3. The code treats ports 80 and 443 identically, which is incorrect
4. Other non-standard ports are correctly preserved
5. The bug is easily reproducible and fixable

The suggested fix in the bug report is correct and should be implemented.
