## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considerations for Each Category:

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function's type signature explicitly promises to accept `Union[int, str, None]`
- The function crashes with ValueError on valid string inputs (empty string, non-numeric strings)
- FastAPI's own code allows string status codes in the `responses` parameter (Dict[Union[int, str], ...])
- Users can legitimately provide custom string status codes in their API responses
- The crash happens in production code when users provide valid inputs per the API contract
- The function violates its own type contract - a clear bug

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- One could argue that only "reasonable" status codes should be accepted
- The OpenAPI spec defines specific patterns for status codes

#### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug is real and reproducible

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function demonstrably crashes on inputs its type signature claims to accept
- The type system explicitly allows any string, not just numeric ones
- FastAPI's routing explicitly allows string status codes in responses

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Users typically use standard HTTP status codes (integers)
- Non-numeric string status codes are uncommon in practice

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty strings and non-numeric strings are common
- The bug causes production crashes, not just incorrect behavior
- FastAPI explicitly supports string status codes in its API
- The fix is straightforward and improves robustness

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Supporting arbitrary non-numeric strings could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The type signature already claims to support all strings
- This is not asking for new functionality, but for the existing contract to be honored
- The function already handles some string patterns ("default", "1XX", etc.)

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The type hint could be updated to reflect current behavior: `Union[int, Literal["default", "1XX", ...], str]` where str must be numeric

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Changing the type signature would be a breaking change
- FastAPI's routing layer explicitly allows arbitrary string status codes
- The bug is in the implementation, not the documentation
- Users rely on the current type contract

### Final Assessment:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function:
1. Has a type signature that promises to accept any string
2. Is used in contexts where arbitrary strings are allowed (FastAPI's responses dict)
3. Crashes on valid inputs according to its type contract
4. Violates the principle that functions should handle all inputs matching their type signatures

The function should either:
- Handle non-numeric strings gracefully (return a sensible default or raise a more specific exception)
- Have its type signature changed to reflect actual accepted inputs (breaking change)

Given that FastAPI allows string status codes in responses, and this function is used to validate those, it should handle all string inputs without crashing.
