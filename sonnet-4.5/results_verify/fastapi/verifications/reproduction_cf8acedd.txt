## Reproduction of TrustedHostMiddleware IPv6 Bug

### Bug Report Verification
The bug report claims that TrustedHostMiddleware incorrectly parses IPv6 addresses in the Host header due to using `.split(":")[0]` which breaks on IPv6 addresses containing multiple colons.

### Source Code Confirmation
I examined the actual source code at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/fastapi_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/trustedhost.py` line 40:
```python
host = headers.get("host", "").split(":")[0]
```

This confirms the bug report's claim about the implementation.

### Test Execution Results

#### 1. Specific Test Cases
All test cases from the bug report were verified and behave exactly as reported:
- `[::1]` → `[` (Expected: `[::1]`)
- `[::1]:8000` → `[` (Expected: `[::1]`)
- `[2001:db8::1]` → `[2001` (Expected: `[2001:db8::1]`)
- `[2001:db8::1]:8080` → `[2001` (Expected: `[2001:db8::1]`)

#### 2. Hypothesis Testing
The hypothesis test successfully generated numerous failing cases. Every single IPv6 address tested failed because the first colon causes incorrect splitting:
- `[0:0]` → `[0` (the specific example from the bug report)
- Over 100 randomly generated IPv6 addresses all failed in the same way
- The pattern is consistent: everything after the first colon is discarded

#### 3. Proposed Fix Verification
The proposed fix was tested and works correctly:
```python
if host_header.startswith("["):
    # IPv6 address
    host = host_header.split("]")[0] + "]"
else:
    host = host_header.split(":")[0]
```

This correctly handles:
- IPv6 addresses with and without ports
- IPv4 addresses with and without ports
- Domain names with and without ports

#### 4. Edge Cases
Additional edge cases were tested:
- `[::ffff:192.0.2.1]` (IPv4-mapped IPv6) - fails with current, works with fix
- `[fe80::1%eth0]` (Link-local with zone ID) - fails with current, works with fix
- `[::]` (All zeros) - fails with current, works with fix

### Conclusion
The bug is 100% reproducible. The current implementation cannot handle ANY IPv6 address in the Host header, causing all IPv6 requests to be incorrectly parsed. The extracted host becomes just "[" or "[xxxx" (up to first colon), which will never match any valid allowed_hosts pattern, causing legitimate IPv6 requests to be rejected with a 400 error.
