## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully ran the bug report's test cases and confirmed the reported behavior.

### Basic Reproduction Test
```
Initial: main = {"items": [1, 2]}, update = {"items": [3]}
After 1st call: {"items": [1, 2, 3]}
After 2nd call: {"items": [1, 2, 3, 3]}
```
**Result**: The list grows with each call, confirming non-idempotent behavior.

### Simple Example Test
```
Initial: main = {}, update = {"items": [1, 2, 3]}
After 1st call: {"items": [1, 2, 3]}
After 2nd call: {"items": [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]}
```
**Result**: Idempotence is violated - the list is duplicated on the second call.

### Comparison Tests

1. **Nested dictionaries**:
   - Behavior: Idempotent ✓
   - Multiple calls with same update produce same result

2. **Simple values**:
   - Behavior: Idempotent ✓
   - Multiple calls with same update produce same result

3. **Lists**:
   - Behavior: Non-idempotent ✗
   - Lists are concatenated on each call

### Hypothesis Property Test
The hypothesis test failed immediately with a minimal example:
```
First call: {'0': [0]}
Second call: {'0': [0, 0]}
```

### Technical Accuracy
The bug report is technically accurate:
1. The function does concatenate lists rather than merge them idempotently
2. The idempotence property `f(f(x, y), y) = f(x, y)` is violated for list values
3. The behavior is inconsistent - dicts and simple values are handled idempotently, but lists are not

### Implementation Analysis
Looking at the code (lines 195-200 in utils.py):
```python
elif (
    key in main_dict
    and isinstance(main_dict[key], list)
    and isinstance(update_dict[key], list)
):
    main_dict[key] = main_dict[key] + update_dict[key]
```
The `+` operator concatenates lists, creating a new list with all elements from both lists. This is clearly non-idempotent.

### Actual vs Expected
The bug report's claim about expected vs actual behavior is accurate. A reasonable expectation for an "update" operation would be idempotence, matching the behavior of Python's standard update operations.
