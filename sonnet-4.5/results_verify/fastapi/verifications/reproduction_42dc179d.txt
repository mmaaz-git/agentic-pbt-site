REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The test results confirm that:

1. The simple reproduction case works exactly as described:
   - Created a ServerVariable with enum=["production", "staging", "development"] and default="invalid_environment"
   - The ServerVariable was created successfully without raising any validation error
   - The default value "invalid_environment" is indeed not in the enum list
   - This violates the OpenAPI specification requirement

2. The property-based test using Hypothesis ran successfully:
   - Tested 200 different combinations of enum values and default values
   - In all cases where the default was not in the enum list, the ServerVariable was created without error
   - The test assertions confirm that invalid defaults are accepted

3. The specific failing example from the bug report also reproduces:
   - enum=["production", "staging"], default="invalid" creates a ServerVariable without error
   - The default value is confirmed to not be in the enum list

The bug is reproducible and the effect is that FastAPI allows creation of ServerVariable objects with invalid default values that violate the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification. This could lead to invalid OpenAPI documents being generated, which might cause issues with API documentation tools, client generation, and API validation.
