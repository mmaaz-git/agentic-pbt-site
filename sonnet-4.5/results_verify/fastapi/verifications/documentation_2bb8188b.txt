DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS

1. FastAPI OAuth2PasswordBearer Documentation:
   - The auto_error parameter is documented to control whether the dependency raises an HTTPException or returns None
   - When auto_error=False, the documentation states it should return None when authentication is not available
   - The documentation does not explicitly define what "authentication is not available" means
   - Examples show checking "if not token" or "if token is None" interchangeably, implying None is the expected return value

2. FastAPI Source Code Comments:
   - The source code shows that when auto_error=False and authentication fails, it returns None
   - The condition checks: "if not authorization or scheme.lower() != 'bearer'"
   - The code returns the param (token) portion of the Authorization header when the scheme is "bearer"
   - There is no explicit check for whether param is empty

3. RFC 6750 OAuth2 Bearer Token Specification:
   - Defines the format as "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   - The token must be base64-encoded with specific allowed characters
   - Does not explicitly state that an empty token is invalid
   - However, the syntax implies at least one character is required for a valid token
   - States that if authentication credentials are missing, server should return 401

4. Key Documentation Gap:
   - Neither FastAPI documentation nor RFC 6750 explicitly addresses the edge case of "Authorization: Bearer" with no token
   - The documentation does not distinguish between:
     a) No Authorization header at all
     b) Authorization header with wrong scheme
     c) Authorization header with correct scheme but no token
   - All three cases logically represent "authentication is not available"

5. User Expectations from Documentation:
   - Based on the documentation stating auto_error=False returns None when "authentication is not available"
   - An empty token string ("") is not valid authentication credentials
   - Users would reasonably expect consistent behavior: both missing header and empty token should return None
