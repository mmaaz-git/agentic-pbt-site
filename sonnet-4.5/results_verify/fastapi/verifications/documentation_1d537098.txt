## Documentation Analysis

### FastAPI Documentation
The FastAPI documentation does not explicitly describe the behavior of `get_typed_annotation` or how it handles string type annotations. The function appears to be an internal utility function not documented in the public API. The documentation focuses on high-level usage of type annotations with dependencies but does not specify:
- What string annotations are valid
- How forward references are processed
- What happens with invalid type annotation strings
- Whether Python keywords are supported in string annotations

### Python Documentation on Type Annotations

1. **ForwardRef**: The Python typing module documentation does not provide comprehensive details about ForwardRef's requirements. ForwardRef is described as an "Internal wrapper to hold a forward reference" with minimal public documentation.

2. **String Annotations**: Python allows any string as a type annotation at the syntax level. The string `"if"` is syntactically valid in Python as an annotation:
   - `def foo(x: "if")` is valid Python syntax
   - The annotation is stored as the literal string "if"
   - Python itself does not evaluate or validate the content of string annotations unless explicitly requested

3. **Keywords in Type Context**: The Python documentation shows that keywords cannot be used in certain typing contexts (e.g., TypedDict keys), requiring functional syntax as a workaround. However, this is about using keywords as identifiers, not as string annotations.

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **FastAPI's Assumption**: FastAPI assumes that all string type annotations are meant to be forward references to actual types that will be resolved. This assumption is not documented.

2. **ForwardRef Limitations**: Python's ForwardRef class requires the string to be a valid Python expression, excluding keywords. This limitation is not well-documented and is only discoverable through testing or reading the source code.

3. **Error Handling**: Neither FastAPI nor Python's typing documentation specifies what should happen when an invalid forward reference is encountered.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not specify that string annotations containing Python keywords should be rejected. The behavior is an undocumented implementation detail arising from FastAPI's use of Python's ForwardRef class, which has its own undocumented restrictions.
