## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Arguments FOR:**
- The middleware incorrectly strips port 443 when redirecting from HTTP to HTTPS
- Port 443 is NOT the standard port for HTTP (port 80 is), so it should be preserved
- This causes actual functional problems: HTTP services on port 443 lose their port specification
- The behavior violates standard URL conventions where non-standard ports are preserved
- The fix is straightforward and logical: only strip the standard port for the source scheme
- Real-world impact: Misconfigured redirects could send users to wrong services

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code works as implemented (strips both 80 and 443 consistently)
- Port 443 for HTTP is an unusual configuration

**Verdict:** Strong candidate - the logic error is clear and has real impact

#### 2. INVALID

**Arguments FOR:**
- The code does what it's programmed to do (strip ports 80 and 443)
- Documentation doesn't explicitly specify port handling behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior violates standard web conventions
- Port 443 is objectively not the standard port for HTTP
- The bug causes actual functional problems, not just theoretical ones

**Verdict:** Unlikely - the issue represents genuinely incorrect behavior

#### 3. WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR:**
- Running HTTP on port 443 is an edge case/unusual configuration
- Most users won't encounter this scenario
- The workaround exists (use custom middleware)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality
- The bug violates standard URL conventions
- It's not just an obscure edge case but a logical error in port handling

**Verdict:** Unlikely - the issue is legitimate and the fix is straightforward

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as requesting "smarter" port handling
- Documentation doesn't promise correct port preservation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The middleware already attempts to handle ports, just incorrectly
- Standard URL conventions dictate the expected behavior

**Verdict:** Unlikely - this is a bug fix, not a feature addition

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't specify port handling behavior
- Could document the current behavior as "intended"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is objectively incorrect per web standards
- Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it correct
- The issue is with the implementation, not documentation

**Verdict:** Unlikely - the problem is in the code logic, not documentation

### Final Assessment

This is a **BUG**. The middleware contains a logic error that incorrectly treats port 443 as strippable for HTTP requests, when port 443 is only the standard port for HTTPS, not HTTP. This violates standard URL conventions and causes functional problems for legitimate (if uncommon) configurations where HTTP services run on port 443.

The key insight is that the middleware should only strip the **standard port for the source scheme**:
- For HTTP→HTTPS: strip port 80 (standard for HTTP)
- For WS→WSS: strip port 80 (standard for WS)
- All other ports, including 443 for HTTP/WS sources, should be preserved

The proposed fix correctly addresses this by checking against the source scheme's standard port rather than a hardcoded list.
