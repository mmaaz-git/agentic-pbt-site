## Documentation Findings for is_union_of_base_models

### Function Location and Purpose
The function `is_union_of_base_models` is an internal utility function in FastAPI located at `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py`. It is not a publicly documented API function but rather an internal helper used by FastAPI's dependency injection system.

### Function Documentation
The function has a docstring that states:
"Check if field type is a Union where all members are BaseModel subclasses."

### Usage Context
The function is used internally in the `_should_embed_body_fields` function (line 856) to determine whether Form fields need to be embedded. Specifically, it checks if a Form field's type is a Union of BaseModel classes, which affects how FastAPI handles form data parsing.

### Key Observations
1. This is an internal, undocumented function - not part of FastAPI's public API
2. The docstring clearly states the intent: check if ALL members of a Union are BaseModel subclasses
3. The function is used in a specific context related to Form field embedding logic
4. There is no external documentation specifying the expected behavior for edge cases like empty Unions

### Implications for the Bug Report
Since this is an internal function:
- There's no public API contract that users should rely on
- The behavior for edge cases (like empty Unions) is not documented
- The function appears to be used only in one specific internal context where empty Unions are unlikely to occur naturally
- Python's typing system doesn't normally create empty Union types (Union with no arguments)
