# Documentation Analysis

## Available Documentation

### Source Code Documentation
The API key authentication classes (APIKeyHeader, APIKeyQuery, APIKeyCookie) have the following documented behavior:

1. **Purpose**: Extract API key value from request (header/query/cookie) and provide it as a dependency result
2. **auto_error parameter**:
   - When True (default): Missing keys cause HTTP 403 error
   - When False: Missing keys return None for optional authentication

3. **Return Value**: "The dependency result will be a string containing the key value"

### What Documentation Does NOT Specify

The documentation does not explicitly state:
1. How whitespace-only values should be handled
2. What constitutes a "missing" or "not provided" key
3. Whether there's a difference between:
   - Completely missing header/parameter
   - Present but empty ("")
   - Present but whitespace-only (" ")

### Behavioral Analysis

From the docstring of auto_error:
- "when the header is not available" → returns None or raises error
- "if the header is not provided" → returns None or raises error

The documentation uses "not available" and "not provided" language, which is ambiguous about whether a header with whitespace counts as "provided" or not.

### Security Implications

The documentation states these are for "API key authentication" - a security feature. Standard security practice would dictate that:
1. Empty values should not authenticate
2. Whitespace-only values should not authenticate
3. Authentication tokens should be meaningful, non-blank values

### Comparison with HTTP Standards

HTTP headers can contain whitespace, and are not automatically trimmed by the protocol. This means:
- A client sending "X-API-Key: " (with spaces) is valid HTTP
- The server receives the spaces as part of the value
- It's the application's responsibility to validate appropriately

## Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly specify how whitespace should be handled, but:
1. For a security feature, accepting whitespace-only keys violates the principle of least surprise
2. The inconsistent treatment of "" vs " " suggests this is unintentional
3. The lack of documentation about whitespace handling doesn't make this behavior correct - it makes it undefined, and the current implementation is problematic from a security standpoint
