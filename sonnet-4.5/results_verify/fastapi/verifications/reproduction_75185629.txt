Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction:
   - Ran the property-based test provided in the bug report
   - The test FAILED with the exact input mentioned: ['accept']
   - Error message confirmed: "Duplicate headers found! Input: ['accept'], Output: ['accept', 'accept-language', 'content-language', 'content-type', 'accept']"

2. Simple Reproduction Test:
   - Created a simple test case with CORSMiddleware(dummy_app, allow_headers=["accept"])
   - Confirmed the output: ['accept', 'accept-language', 'content-language', 'content-type', 'accept']
   - The header 'accept' appears twice in the list (at positions 0 and 4)

3. Root Cause Verification:
   - Examined the source code at /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/fastapi_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/middleware/cors.py
   - Confirmed the issue occurs at lines 58 and 67 as stated in the bug report:
     * Line 58: `allow_headers = sorted(SAFELISTED_HEADERS | set(allow_headers))`
       - SAFELISTED_HEADERS contains {'Accept', 'Accept-Language', 'Content-Language', 'Content-Type'}
       - When user provides ["accept"], the set union produces both "Accept" and "accept"
     * Line 67: `self.allow_headers = [h.lower() for h in allow_headers]`
       - This converts all headers to lowercase, creating the duplicate "accept"

4. Impact:
   - The resulting allow_headers list contains duplicates when user-provided headers differ only in case from safelisted headers
   - This affects the internal state of the middleware and could lead to:
     * Inefficient header checking (checking "accept" twice)
     * Potential issues in CORS preflight responses
     * Unexpected behavior in header validation logic

The bug is reproducible and behaves exactly as described in the report.
