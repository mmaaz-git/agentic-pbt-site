# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function behavior contradicts reasonable expectations - an explicitly set empty string should be respected
2. The type annotation `Optional[str]` allows empty strings as valid input, suggesting they should be handled
3. The OpenAPI specification allows empty strings for the summary field
4. The fix is straightforward and logical: change `if route.summary:` to `if route.summary is not None:`
5. Users who explicitly set `summary=""` have clear intent that differs from not setting it at all
6. The current behavior silently ignores user input, which violates the principle of least surprise

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Could argue that empty summaries provide no value, so auto-generation is helpful
- The current behavior has likely existed for a while without major complaints

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that empty strings will be preserved
- Could argue that truthy checks are common in Python and expected behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The bug is real and reproducible
2. The type system explicitly allows empty strings
3. The OpenAPI spec allows empty strings
4. Standard programming conventions distinguish between None and empty string

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an edge case - most users don't intentionally set empty summaries
- The auto-generated summary might be considered more useful than an empty one
- Low severity issue that doesn't break functionality

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The fix is simple and non-breaking
2. It improves API consistency and predictability
3. Some users may have valid reasons for empty summaries (e.g., programmatically generated APIs)

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame as "Add support for empty summary strings"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This isn't requesting new functionality - empty strings are already valid per the type signature
2. The current behavior is a bug, not a missing feature
3. The type system already suggests this should work

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explain the current behavior
- Could document that empty strings trigger auto-generation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code behavior is incorrect, not the documentation
2. Documenting this behavior would cement a counterintuitive design choice
3. The fix should be in the code, not documentation

## Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The function violates reasonable expectations by treating an explicitly provided empty string the same as None. The type annotations and OpenAPI spec both support empty strings as valid values. The current behavior silently discards user input, which is unexpected and undocumented. While it's a low-severity edge case, it's still incorrect behavior that should be fixed rather than documented or ignored.
