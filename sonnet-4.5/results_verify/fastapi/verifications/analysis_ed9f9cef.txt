BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Evaluating Each Category:

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code explicitly uses `set()` to deduplicate and `sorted()` to sort headers
- These operations fail due to incorrect ordering with `.lower()`
- HTTP headers are case-insensitive by RFC 9110, so 'Q' and 'q' should be treated as the same header
- Having duplicate lowercase headers violates HTTP standards and the code's clear intent
- The fix is straightforward and logical

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise deduplication or sorting
- The behavior might be considered an implementation detail

**Likelihood: HIGH**

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state headers will be deduplicated or sorted
- Could argue this is unspecified behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code clearly attempts to deduplicate (using set()) and sort (using sorted())
- HTTP standards specify headers are case-insensitive, so duplicates differing only in case are incorrect
- The bug violates the code's own intent as evidenced by the use of set() and sorted()

**Likelihood: LOW**

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be considered a minor issue that rarely affects real-world usage
- Most developers probably don't pass duplicate headers with different cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a clear violation of HTTP standards
- The fix is simple and doesn't break compatibility
- Having duplicate headers could cause actual issues in CORS handling

**Likelihood: LOW**

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- If deduplication/sorting wasn't originally intended, this could be a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code already attempts to deduplicate and sort - it just does it incorrectly
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality

**Likelihood: VERY LOW**

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document the current behavior instead of fixing it

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The current behavior violates HTTP standards (case-insensitive headers)
- The code's intent is clear from using set() and sorted()
- Documenting buggy behavior doesn't make it correct

**Likelihood: LOW**

## Final Assessment:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The code demonstrates clear intent to deduplicate and sort headers through its use of `set()` and `sorted()`, but these operations fail because they occur before lowercasing. Since HTTP headers are case-insensitive by specification (RFC 9110), having duplicate headers that differ only in case is incorrect behavior. The bug is not trivial - it violates both HTTP standards and the code's own internal logic.
