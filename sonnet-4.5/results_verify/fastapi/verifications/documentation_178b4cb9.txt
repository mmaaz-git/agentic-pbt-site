DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR FASTAPI OPENAPI DOCS FUNCTIONS
==========================================================

I reviewed the FastAPI documentation and source code for the `get_swagger_ui_html` and `get_redoc_html` functions.

## Official Documentation Review

The FastAPI documentation describes these functions as:
- `get_swagger_ui_html`: "Generate and return the HTML that loads Swagger UI for the interactive API docs"
- `get_redoc_html`: "Generate and return the HTML response that loads ReDoc for the alternative API docs"

The documentation indicates that these functions accept parameters including:
- `openapi_url`: The URL for the OpenAPI specification
- `title`: The HTML page title to be displayed in the browser tab

## Key Documentation Findings

1. **No Security Warnings**: The documentation does NOT mention anything about escaping, sanitization, or security considerations for the `title` and `openapi_url` parameters.

2. **Parameter Descriptions**:
   - The `title` parameter is documented as "The HTML `<title>` content, normally shown in the browser tab"
   - The `openapi_url` parameter is documented as "The OpenAPI URL that Swagger UI should load and use"

3. **Expected Usage**: The documentation suggests these functions are "normally done automatically by FastAPI" but can be called directly "if you needed to override some parts"

4. **No Input Validation Requirements**: There is no documentation specifying that these inputs should be validated, sanitized, or that they have any restrictions on allowed characters.

## Source Code Analysis

The source code (fastapi/openapi/docs.py) shows:
1. Both functions use Python f-strings to directly interpolate user inputs into HTML
2. The `title` parameter is inserted directly into `<title>{title}</title>` tags without escaping
3. The `openapi_url` is inserted:
   - In Swagger UI: Into JavaScript as `url: '{openapi_url}'` without JavaScript escaping
   - In ReDoc: Into HTML attribute as `<redoc spec-url="{openapi_url}">` without HTML escaping

## Security Context

While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise that these functions will escape HTML/JavaScript, there is a reasonable expectation that:
1. Functions generating HTML should properly escape user inputs to prevent XSS
2. This is a fundamental security best practice, especially for a web framework
3. The parameters are described as URLs and titles, not as "raw HTML/JavaScript" that would be intentionally unescaped

## Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly state that inputs will be escaped, but it also doesn't warn that they won't be. Given that these are public API functions in a web framework that generate HTML, there is a reasonable expectation of secure handling of inputs. The lack of any security warnings or notes about the need for pre-escaping inputs suggests users would expect the functions to handle escaping internally.
