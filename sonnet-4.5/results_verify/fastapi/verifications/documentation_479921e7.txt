# Documentation Analysis

## Function Status
The `generate_operation_id_for_path` function is **DEPRECATED**. The function itself contains a deprecation warning that states:
- "fastapi.utils.generate_operation_id_for_path() was deprecated"
- "it is not used internally"
- "will be removed soon"

## Function Documentation
There is NO formal documentation for this specific function. It has:
- No docstring
- No official documentation page
- Only a deprecation warning
- A `# pragma: nocover` comment indicating it's not covered by tests

## OpenAPI Specification Requirements
According to the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for `operationId`:
1. Must be a unique string to identify the operation
2. Must be unique among all operations in the API
3. Is case-sensitive
4. "It is RECOMMENDED to follow common programming naming conventions"

The specification does NOT:
- Define explicit character restrictions
- Mandate specific format requirements
- Prohibit special characters

## Programming Naming Convention Best Practices
The OpenAPI specification recommends following "common programming naming conventions" which typically means:
- Using alphanumeric characters
- Using underscores or camelCase
- Avoiding special characters
- Following identifier rules from programming languages

## FastAPI's Approach
1. The deprecated `generate_operation_id_for_path` function uses `re.sub(r"\W", "_", operation_id)` to replace non-word characters with underscores for the concatenated name+path
2. The replacement function `generate_unique_id` follows the same pattern (sanitizes name+path but not method)
3. FastAPI documentation shows examples using clean operation IDs without special characters

## Key Finding
The function has NO documented behavior specification regarding:
- What characters should be allowed in inputs
- What the output format should be
- Whether all parameters should be sanitized consistently

The function is applying sanitization inconsistently without any documented reason for this behavior. However, since:
1. The function is deprecated and not used internally
2. It will be removed soon
3. There's no documentation defining its expected behavior
4. The OpenAPI spec only "recommends" following naming conventions but doesn't mandate it

This makes the behavior technically undefined, as there's no specification stating that the function MUST sanitize all parameters consistently.
