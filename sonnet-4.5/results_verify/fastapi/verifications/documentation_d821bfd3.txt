DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR fastapi.openapi.docs
================================================

Official Documentation Review:
-----------------------------
1. The FastAPI documentation at https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/openapi/docs/ describes get_swagger_ui_html and get_redoc_html as functions that generate HTML for interactive API documentation.

2. The documentation describes the parameters:
   - openapi_url: The URL for OpenAPI specification
   - title: Browser tab title
   - oauth2_redirect_url: OAuth2 redirect URL (for Swagger UI)
   - Various URLs for loading JavaScript and CSS assets

3. Security Considerations in Documentation:
   - The documentation DOES NOT mention any requirement for HTML escaping
   - The documentation DOES NOT warn about XSS vulnerabilities
   - The documentation DOES NOT specify that user-provided parameters should be sanitized
   - The general FastAPI security documentation focuses on authentication/authorization, not input sanitization

4. Function Purpose and Context:
   - These functions are typically used internally by FastAPI to serve documentation endpoints
   - When used in the default way (/docs and /redoc endpoints), the parameters are typically hardcoded or come from trusted sources
   - However, the functions are public API and can be called directly with user-provided values

5. Source Code Documentation (from docs.py):
   - The docstrings describe what the functions do but make no mention of security considerations
   - The functions state they generate HTML but don't warn about the need to escape user input
   - The documentation says "You would only call this function yourself if you needed to override some parts"

Key Finding:
The documentation does not explicitly state that these functions will escape user input to prevent XSS. There is no security warning about passing untrusted data to these functions. The documentation also doesn't explicitly state that only trusted input should be used.
