## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Execution Results

1. **Simple Reproduction Test:**
   - The provided test case reproduces the bug exactly as described
   - When an endpoint has a Query parameter with an uncopyable default value and the parameter is not provided in the request, FastAPI crashes with `TypeError: Cannot deepcopy this object`
   - The traceback confirms the failure occurs at line 736 in `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py` in the `_get_multidict_value` function

2. **Hypothesis-Based Test:**
   - The property-based test failed on every single test case (100+ different integer values)
   - This demonstrates the bug is deterministic and consistent - it occurs for ANY uncopyable object as a default value, regardless of the object's internal state

3. **Traceback Analysis:**
   The error chain shows:
   - FastAPI attempts to solve dependencies for the request
   - When processing query parameters, it calls `_get_multidict_value`
   - When the parameter is not provided, it attempts to return `deepcopy(field.default)`
   - This triggers pydantic's `smart_deepcopy` which ultimately calls Python's standard `deepcopy`
   - The custom `__deepcopy__` method raises TypeError, causing the crash

### Technical Details Confirmed

1. **Conditions for Bug:**
   - A Query parameter must have a default value that is an object
   - The object must not support deepcopy (raises TypeError in `__deepcopy__`)
   - The parameter must not be provided in the actual request

2. **Why This Happens:**
   - FastAPI uses deepcopy to protect against mutable default arguments (a common Python pitfall)
   - The deepcopy happens unconditionally when returning default values
   - There is no fallback mechanism for objects that cannot be deepcopied

3. **Valid Use Cases Affected:**
   The bug report correctly identifies legitimate use cases where uncopyable objects might be used as defaults:
   - Singleton objects (which should never be copied)
   - Database connections or connection pools
   - Thread locks or synchronization primitives
   - Objects wrapping external resources
   - Custom objects that intentionally prevent copying for design reasons

### Bug Verification

The bug is **technically correct** - the code does crash when using uncopyable objects as default values for query parameters. The crash happens at runtime during request processing, not at application startup, which makes it particularly problematic as it could cause production failures.
