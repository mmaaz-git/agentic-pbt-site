BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### 1. INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state that nested exclude should work for plain dicts
- One could argue the function only promises Pydantic-like behavior for Pydantic models

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The docstring says it accepts "Pydantic's exclude parameter", implying Pydantic-like behavior
- The function already supports nested exclude for Pydantic models and dataclasses
- When a dict like `{"user": {"password"}}` is provided as exclude, the current behavior (excluding the entire "user" key) makes no sense and is clearly incorrect
- The type hints accept dict-form exclude, which only makes sense for nested exclusion

### 2. WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Users could work around this by converting dicts to Pydantic models first
- The bug only affects plain dicts, not the primary use case (Pydantic models)

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - nested field exclusion is a common requirement
- The inconsistent behavior between plain dicts and Pydantic models is confusing
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality
- Plain dict support is an advertised feature of jsonable_encoder

### 3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise nested exclude for plain dicts
- Could document that nested exclude only works with Pydantic models

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The current behavior is clearly broken (excludes entire parent instead of nested field)
- No reasonable user would expect `exclude={"user": {"password"}}` to exclude the entire "user" key
- The code already attempts to support dict-form exclude but implements it incorrectly
- Documenting this limitation would be acknowledging a bug rather than clarifying intended behavior

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Nested exclude for plain dicts could be seen as a new feature
- The function might have been designed only for simple exclude on plain dicts

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The function already accepts dict-form exclude parameters
- The current implementation when given dict-form exclude is broken, not just missing
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capability
- The function explicitly claims to accept "Pydantic's exclude parameter"

### 5. BUG
**Why this IS a BUG:**
- The function accepts dict-form exclude but handles it incorrectly
- Current behavior excludes entire parent keys when nested exclusion is requested
- Inconsistent behavior between plain dicts and Pydantic models/dataclasses
- The docstring references "Pydantic's exclude parameter" but doesn't implement Pydantic-like behavior for dicts
- The fix is straightforward and aligns the behavior with user expectations
- No reasonable interpretation of `exclude={"user": {"password"}}` would expect the entire "user" key to be excluded
- The code at line 270 (`allowed_keys -= set(exclude)`) is clearly wrong when exclude is a dict

## Decision Rationale

This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The function accepts dict-form exclude parameters but processes them incorrectly for plain dict objects. When a user provides `exclude={"user": {"password"}}`, they clearly intend to exclude only the "password" field within "user", not the entire "user" object. The current implementation's behavior of excluding the entire parent key is nonsensical and represents a clear logic error in the code.

The bug is not trivial - it affects a core functionality of the encoder and creates inconsistent behavior between different input types. The proposed fix is reasonable and would align the behavior with both Pydantic conventions and user expectations.
