BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The asymmetry is clearly demonstrated and reproducible
- The asymmetry is specifically related to infinity and mask interaction, not the documented tolerance-based asymmetry
- The current behavior is counterintuitive: when comparing masked vs unmasked infinity, the result depends on argument order
- This appears to be an implementation bug in the infinity checking logic, not intentional design
- The proposed fix is reasonable and would restore symmetry for this specific case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The parent function `numpy.allclose` is documented as potentially asymmetric
- The documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee symmetry

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation for `numpy.allclose` explicitly states it may be asymmetric
- `numpy.ma.allclose` inherits from `numpy.allclose` and could inherit its asymmetry
- The documentation doesn't promise symmetry

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documented asymmetry is about tolerance calculations, not mask/infinity interaction
- The bug creates a different type of asymmetry than what's documented
- Users would reasonably expect mask handling to be symmetric

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an edge case involving infinity and masked values
- The asymmetry might rarely affect real-world usage
- Fixing it could potentially break existing code that depends on current behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This violates intuitive expectations about comparison operations
- The fix is straightforward and wouldn't affect normal use cases
- Property-based testing revealed this issue, suggesting it's worth fixing

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't specify behavior for infinity with masked values
- Could document the current behavior as expected
- The asymmetry could be considered a "feature" that needs documentation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior appears to be a bug, not an undocumented feature
- The asymmetry is unintuitive and likely unintended

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could frame this as requesting symmetric behavior for mask/infinity cases
- The current code doesn't handle this case well

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Users already expect symmetry in comparison operations

## Detailed Analysis

The key issue is that this asymmetry is DIFFERENT from the documented asymmetry:

1. **Documented asymmetry**: Due to the formula `|a - b| <= (atol + rtol * |b|)` using `|b|` instead of `|a|`
2. **Bug's asymmetry**: Due to incorrect mask application when checking infinities

The bug creates the following illogical behavior:
- `allclose([inf], [masked])` = True (treats masked as "don't care")
- `allclose([masked], [inf])` = False (fails infinity check)

This is clearly inconsistent. If masked values are "don't care" values that match anything (when `masked_equal=True`), then the comparison should be symmetric.

## Recommendation

This should be classified as **BUG**. The asymmetry caused by mask/infinity interaction is:
1. Not the same as the documented tolerance-based asymmetry
2. Logically inconsistent with the concept of masked values
3. Clearly a bug in the implementation logic
4. Fixable without affecting the documented behavior
