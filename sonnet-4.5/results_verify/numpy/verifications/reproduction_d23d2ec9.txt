REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

Bug Report Summary:
The bug report claims that when creating a numpy masked array with mask=False (Python bool) and shrink=True, the mask is incorrectly expanded to a boolean array instead of being compressed to nomask, unlike the behavior with mask=np.False_.

Reproduction Results:

1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction:
   - The provided Hypothesis test fails as expected
   - The test creates masked arrays with both np.False_ and Python False as masks
   - With np.False_ and shrink=True: mask becomes nomask (passes assertion)
   - With Python False and shrink=True: mask becomes array([False, False, ...]) (fails assertion)
   - Test fails on the very first example with data_list=[0]

2. Manual Test Reproduction:
   - Created arrays with [1, 2, 3] as data
   - With mask=np.False_ and shrink=True:
     * Result: mask is np.False_ (which is ma.nomask)
     * Type: numpy.bool
     * ma.getmask returns nomask
   - With mask=False and shrink=True:
     * Result: mask is array([False, False, False])
     * Type: numpy.ndarray
     * ma.getmask returns the expanded boolean array

3. Observed Behavior:
   - np.False_ (numpy scalar) with shrink=True → correctly compresses to nomask
   - False (Python bool) with shrink=True → incorrectly expands to full boolean array
   - This is inconsistent behavior between two semantically equivalent False values

4. Impact:
   - Memory inefficiency: storing unnecessary boolean arrays
   - API inconsistency: different behavior based on Python vs NumPy scalar
   - Violation of the shrink parameter's documented purpose

The bug is fully reproducible and the behavior matches exactly what the bug report describes.
