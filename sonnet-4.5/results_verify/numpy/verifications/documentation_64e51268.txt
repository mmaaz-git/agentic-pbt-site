DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have reviewed all available documentation for numpy.typing.NBitBase and found the following:

1. OFFICIAL NUMPY DOCUMENTATION (numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html):
   - NBitBase is EXPLICITLY documented as deprecated since version 2.3
   - The deprecation message states: "Deprecated since version 2.3: Use @typing.overload or a
     TypeVar with a scalar-type as upper bound, instead."
   - This confirms that NBitBase SHOULD emit a deprecation warning when accessed

2. NUMPY 2.3.0 RELEASE NOTES (numpy.org/doc/stable/release/2.3.0-notes.html):
   - Confirms NBitBase has been deprecated in version 2.3
   - Explains the rationale: changes in NumPy 2.2.0 made the NBitBase approach problematic
   - Recommends using typing.overload with specific type signatures as an alternative
   - References GitHub PR #28884 for the deprecation

3. SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION:
   - The __getattr__ function at lines 173-184 includes a comment:
     "# Deprecated in NumPy 2.3, 2025-05-01"
   - The warning message in the code matches the documented deprecation:
     "`NBitBase` is deprecated and will be removed from numpy.typing in the
     future. Use `@typing.overload` or a `TypeVar` with a scalar-type as upper
     bound, instead. (deprecated in NumPy 2.3)"

4. INTENDED BEHAVIOR:
   - The documentation and release notes clearly establish that NBitBase is deprecated
   - The code contains explicit logic to emit a DeprecationWarning when NBitBase is accessed
   - Users should be warned when using deprecated features to allow them to migrate their code

CONCLUSION:
The documentation CLEARLY ESTABLISHES that:
1. NBitBase is officially deprecated as of NumPy 2.3
2. A DeprecationWarning SHOULD be emitted when accessing NBitBase
3. The current behavior (no warning emitted) contradicts the documented deprecation

This is NOT a case of unspecified behavior - the deprecation is well-documented in multiple places,
and the code explicitly intends to emit a warning but fails to do so due to the implementation bug.
