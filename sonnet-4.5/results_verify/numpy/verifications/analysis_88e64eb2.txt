BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

Analyzing whether this should be categorized as BUG, WONTFIX, INVALID, DOCUMENTATION_FIX, or FEATURE_REQUEST:

CASE FOR BUG:
- The function exhibits inconsistent behavior: [True] preserves shape but [False] doesn't
- The documentation states return type is "ndarray" but sometimes returns a scalar
- The inconsistency breaks the principle of least surprise - functions should behave predictably
- Shape preservation is a reasonable expectation for array operations
- The bug affects downstream functions like mask_or which inherit this inconsistency
- Makes it impossible to write reliable code without checking both value AND shape

CASE FOR WONTFIX:
- The behavior is explicitly demonstrated in the documentation examples
- The shrink parameter's purpose is to collapse all-False masks to nomask
- This has been the behavior for a long time and changing it would break compatibility
- Users can use shrink=False to get consistent shape preservation
- The performance benefit of returning a scalar for all-False masks might be intentional

CASE FOR INVALID:
- The documentation examples clearly show this behavior happening
- The parameter is called "shrink" which could reasonably mean dimension reduction
- nomask is defined as a scalar False, so returning it necessarily changes dimensions
- The behavior is consistent with the concept of "shrinking" to the minimal representation

CASE FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation incorrectly states return type is "ndarray" when it can be a scalar
- The documentation doesn't clearly explain that "shrink" affects dimensionality
- The examples show the behavior but don't explain the rationale or implications
- Better documentation could clarify when shapes are preserved vs collapsed
- The ambiguity in documentation is the real problem, not necessarily the behavior

CASE FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Could add a new parameter to control shape preservation separately from shrinking
- The current API doesn't support getting nomask value while preserving shape
- This could be seen as requesting enhanced functionality rather than fixing a bug

EVALUATION:

The strongest cases are for DOCUMENTATION_FIX or WONTFIX:

1. DOCUMENTATION_FIX is strong because:
   - The return type specification is objectively wrong (says ndarray, returns scalar)
   - The documentation doesn't clearly explain the dimension-collapsing behavior
   - Users reasonably expect shape preservation in array operations

2. WONTFIX is plausible because:
   - The behavior is demonstrated in examples (though not well explained)
   - Changing it would break backward compatibility
   - shrink=False provides a workaround

BUG is less likely because the behavior appears intentional (even if poorly documented) and is demonstrated in the examples.

INVALID is weak because there's a genuine inconsistency and documentation error.

FEATURE_REQUEST is weak because this is about fixing existing behavior, not adding new capabilities.

CONCLUSION: This is most appropriately a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The code works as designed (even if that design is questionable), but the documentation fails to accurately describe the behavior and its implications. The return type specification is incorrect, and the dimension-collapsing effect of shrink=True needs clear explanation.
