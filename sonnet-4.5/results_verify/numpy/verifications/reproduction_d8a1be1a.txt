## Bug Reproduction and Validation

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is real and occurs exactly as described. When `numpy.strings.partition()` is called with a separator that is longer than the input string's dtype width, the separator gets silently truncated.

### Test Results

1. **Specific failing case**: `s='0', sep='00'`
   - Python result: `('0', '', '')`  (correct - separator not found)
   - NumPy result: `('', '0', '')`   (incorrect - acts as if separator '0' was found)

2. **Pattern confirmed across multiple cases**:
   - All cases where separator length > input dtype width show the same bug
   - Examples: ('a', 'ab'), ('12', '123'), ('abc', 'abcd') all fail
   - Cases where separator fits in dtype work correctly

3. **Root cause verified**:
   - When separator '00' (dtype <U2) is cast to input dtype <U1, it becomes '0'
   - This truncated '0' is then found in the input string '0'
   - Results in incorrect partition: `('', '0', '')` instead of `('0', '', '')`

### Effect
The bug causes incorrect behavior that violates the expected semantics of the partition function. When a separator is not found (because it's longer than what could possibly be in the input), the function should return `(string, '', '')`. Instead, due to silent truncation, it may incorrectly "find" a truncated version of the separator and return wrong results.

This is a significant logic error that produces incorrect results silently without any warning to the user.
