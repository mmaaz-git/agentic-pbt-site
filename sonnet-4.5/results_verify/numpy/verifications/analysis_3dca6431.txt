## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation explicitly promises "Raises AxisError If any axis provided is out of range"
- The function raises OverflowError instead for values outside C int range
- This breaks the documented API contract
- User code expecting to catch AxisError will fail for these cases
- The behavior is inconsistent: some out-of-range values raise AxisError, others raise OverflowError
- The proposed fix is straightforward and reasonable

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is a clear violation of documented behavior.

#### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug report is accurate and well-documented
- The reproduction code works as described
- The issue is consistently reproducible

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Axis values exceeding 2^31 are extremely rare in practice
- Most NumPy arrays don't have billions of dimensions
- The overflow happens at the C boundary, which is a known limitation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation promises specific behavior without caveats
- Breaking API contracts is not trivial, even for edge cases
- The fix is simple and doesn't impact performance
- Consistent exception handling improves reliability
- Python users shouldn't need to know about C int limitations

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that axis values must fit in C int range
- Could add a note about OverflowError for extremely large values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
- The code should match the documentation, not vice versa
- Adding C implementation details to user docs is poor API design
- The fix in code is simpler than documenting exceptions

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Feature)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Supporting axis values beyond C int range could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not requesting new functionality
- The documentation already promises this behavior
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new

### Analysis Summary

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function violates its documented contract by raising the wrong exception type for certain out-of-range values. The documentation makes an unqualified promise that "any axis provided is out of range" will raise AxisError, but this promise is broken for values outside the C int range.

Key factors:
1. **Contract violation**: Clear breach of documented behavior
2. **Inconsistent behavior**: Some invalid axes raise AxisError, others OverflowError
3. **Simple fix available**: The proposed solution is straightforward
4. **User impact**: Code catching AxisError will miss these cases
5. **No documentation caveats**: The docs don't mention C int limitations

While axis values exceeding 2^31 are rare, correctness matters. The API should behave as documented, and implementation details (C int limits) shouldn't leak through as different exception types.
