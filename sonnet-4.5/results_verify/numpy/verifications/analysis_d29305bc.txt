TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

## BUG (Most Likely)
Arguments FOR:
- The code crashes with an unhandled OverflowError when reading back valid data that pandas itself wrote
- The xlrd reader already has the proper math.isfinite() check, showing this is a known issue
- The crash prevents round-tripping of legitimate scientific data (values near sys.float_info.max are valid)
- The fix is simple and consistent with existing code patterns
- No documentation suggests this crash is expected behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- Excel has inherent limitations with very large numbers
- The value does exceed Excel's native precision capabilities

## INVALID
Arguments FOR:
- Excel cannot natively represent values this large without converting to infinity
- User is pushing the limits of what Excel format supports

Arguments AGAINST:
- Pandas wrote the file successfully - it should be able to read it back
- The crash is due to missing error handling, not invalid input
- Other Excel readers in pandas handle this case correctly

## WONTFIX
Arguments FOR:
- Very edge case with extreme values near float limits
- Workaround exists (use different engine or avoid extreme values)

Arguments AGAINST:
- Simple fix available (add math.isfinite() check)
- Inconsistent with xlrd implementation
- Scientific computing legitimately uses large float values
- Crashes rather than returning a reasonable value

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
Arguments FOR:
- Documentation doesn't specify behavior for extreme values
- Could document that extreme values may not round-trip

Arguments AGAINST:
- The issue is clearly a code bug (missing isfinite check)
- Documentation fix wouldn't prevent the crash
- Other readers handle this correctly without special documentation

## FEATURE_REQUEST
Arguments FOR:
- Could be viewed as requesting better handling of edge cases

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The xlrd reader already handles this case
- Basic expectation that written files can be read back

## CONCLUSION
This is clearly a BUG. The openpyxl reader is missing a simple check that the xlrd reader already has. The code crashes on legitimate (if extreme) input values that pandas successfully writes. The fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent across Excel readers.
