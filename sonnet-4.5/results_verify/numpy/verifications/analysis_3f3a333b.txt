## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Evaluation for Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function clearly violates its documented behavior of acting "like in the regular Python slice object"
- The issue affects core functionality - string slicing with explicit None values
- The behavior is objectively incorrect: `'hello'[0:None:2]` returns 'hlo' in Python, but numpy.strings.slice returns empty string
- The bug affects multiple use cases (with and without step parameter)
- The root cause is clearly identified: incorrect swap logic that doesn't account for explicitly passed None values
- This is not an edge case - using None to mean "to the end" is standard Python slicing semantics
- The fix is straightforward and the bug report even provides it

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior clearly contradicts the documented specification
- Python's slicing semantics with None are well-established and unambiguous
- The function fails to implement standard Python behavior that users would reasonably expect

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental slicing pattern
- The bug affects normal, expected usage of the function
- The incorrect behavior would cause silent data corruption (wrong slices returned)

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue the documentation should explicitly state how None values are handled

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation already states it behaves "like in the regular Python slice object"
- Python's handling of None in slices is standard and well-understood
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Changing documentation to match the buggy behavior would make numpy inconsistent with Python

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This isn't requesting new functionality - it's reporting broken existing functionality
- The expected behavior is already documented and standard in Python

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The numpy.strings.slice function fails to correctly implement Python's standard slicing semantics when None is explicitly passed as the stop parameter. The documentation promises Python-like behavior, but the implementation contains a logic error that causes incorrect results. The bug is reproducible, affects normal usage patterns, and has a clear fix.
