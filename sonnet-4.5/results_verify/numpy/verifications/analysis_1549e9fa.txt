## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function might not be intended to support null bytes as separators since null bytes are special characters often used as string terminators in C-style strings. Some might argue that using null bytes as separators is an edge case that falls outside normal usage patterns. The documentation doesn't explicitly state that all possible string characters must work as separators.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
Python strings fully support null bytes as legitimate characters, and the function documentation explicitly states it accepts a "string" parameter with no restrictions. The function works correctly with all other special characters including other control characters like \x01. There's no technical reason why null bytes shouldn't work, and the silent dropping of data without any warning is clearly incorrect behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Null bytes as separators are an extremely rare use case that most users will never encounter. The workaround is simple (use a different separator), and fixing this might require changes to numpy's core string handling which could be considered out of scope for pandas. The function is marked as an auxiliary/internal function, suggesting it might not need to handle all edge cases perfectly.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug causes silent data corruption which is a serious issue regardless of how common the use case is. The fix is actually straightforward and localized to the pandas codebase (converting the separator to an array before passing to numpy.sum). Other users might be relying on null-delimited data formats, and silent data loss is never acceptable behavior for a data processing library.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the intended behavior is to not support null bytes, then the documentation should explicitly state this limitation. Currently, the documentation gives no indication that certain characters won't work as separators. Adding a note about null byte limitations would at least warn users about this behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code clearly attempts to handle any string separator, and the issue is an implementation bug rather than intended behavior. Simply documenting a bug doesn't make it correct - the function should either work correctly or raise an explicit error. Silent data corruption shouldn't be "documented away" as acceptable behavior.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting null bytes as separators could be seen as a new feature request if the original design never intended to support them. The user is asking for functionality that goes beyond what was originally scoped for the function. Adding null byte support would be an enhancement to make the function more robust.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already accepts null bytes without raising an error - it just handles them incorrectly. This isn't asking for new functionality but rather fixing existing broken functionality. The API already suggests this should work (accepts any string), so this is a bug fix rather than a feature addition.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function silently drops null bytes without any warning or error, causing data corruption. The behavior is inconsistent - null bytes work fine when embedded in other characters ('X\x00Y' works) but fail when used alone. The documentation provides no indication of this limitation, and Python strings legitimately support null bytes. The fix is straightforward and the issue is clearly in the pandas code's interaction with numpy.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
Some might argue that null bytes are special cases that fall outside normal string operations, similar to how many C-based systems treat them. The function is marked as auxiliary/internal, potentially suggesting it doesn't need to be fully robust. However, these arguments are weak given Python's full support for null bytes in strings.

**Overall consideration**
This appears to be a legitimate bug in the pandas library. The function accepts a string separator parameter with no documented restrictions, yet silently drops null byte characters leading to data corruption. The reproduction clearly shows that the issue is consistent and specific to null bytes, while all other special characters work correctly. The root cause has been identified as an interaction issue between pandas and numpy when mixing array types.

The fact that the bug causes silent data corruption is particularly serious - the function doesn't raise an error or warning, it just produces incorrect output. This violates the principle of least surprise and could lead to hard-to-debug issues in production systems. While null bytes as separators might be uncommon, they are used in various data formats (null-delimited records, binary protocols, etc.) and pandas as a data processing library should handle them correctly.

The proposed fix (converting the separator to an array) would resolve the issue without breaking existing functionality. This is clearly a bug that should be fixed rather than documented or dismissed as an edge case. Silent data corruption in a widely-used data processing library is always a serious issue regardless of how common the specific use case might be.
