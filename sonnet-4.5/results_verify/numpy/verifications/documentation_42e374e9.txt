## Documentation Analysis for numpy.ma Fill Value Functions

### Official Documentation
The official NumPy documentation for `default_fill_value`, `maximum_fill_value`, and `minimum_fill_value` states that these functions accept:
- **ndarray**: NumPy arrays
- **dtype**: Data type objects
- **scalar**: Scalar values

The documentation describes the parameter as "An object that can be queried for its numeric type."

### Key Observations

1. **Documentation mentions "dtype" as acceptable input**: The documentation explicitly lists "dtype" as an acceptable input type, which is ambiguous because in NumPy terminology:
   - `np.dtype('int32')` is a dtype instance
   - `np.int32` is a dtype class (a type object that subclasses np.generic)

2. **NumPy convention for dtype parameters**: Throughout NumPy, dtype parameters conventionally accept both:
   - Dtype classes (e.g., `np.int32`, `np.float64`)
   - Dtype instances (e.g., `np.dtype('int32')`, `np.dtype('float64')`)
   - String representations (e.g., 'int32', 'float64')

   This is demonstrated by functions like `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, etc., which accept all these forms interchangeably.

3. **Examples in documentation**: The documentation examples show usage with:
   - Scalar instances like `np.int8()` (an instance, not the class)
   - Arrays with dtypes

   However, the examples don't explicitly show using dtype classes like `np.int32` directly.

4. **Ambiguity**: The documentation doesn't explicitly state whether dtype classes (like `np.int32`) should or shouldn't work. Given that:
   - The docs say "dtype" is acceptable
   - NumPy conventionally accepts dtype classes as dtype arguments throughout the library
   - The parameter description says "An object that can be queried for its numeric type"

   It's reasonable to expect that dtype classes should work, as they can be "queried for their numeric type."

### Conclusion
The documentation suggests these functions should accept dtype objects, and NumPy's broader convention is to accept dtype classes interchangeably with dtype instances. The fact that dtype classes don't work appears to be inconsistent with both the documentation's intent and NumPy's general behavior.
