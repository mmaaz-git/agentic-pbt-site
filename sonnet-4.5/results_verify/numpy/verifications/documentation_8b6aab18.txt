## Documentation Analysis

I have thoroughly reviewed the documentation for the `truncate` method in numpy.polynomial.

### Current Documentation
The `truncate` method's docstring states:
1. **Summary**: "Truncate series to length `size`"
2. **Description**: "Reduce the series to length `size` by discarding the high degree terms"
3. **Parameter description**: "The series is reduced to length `size` by discarding the high degree terms"
4. **Return value**: "New instance of series with truncated coefficients"

### Key Observations

1. **Ambiguous Language**: The documentation uses definitive language ("to length `size`") that strongly implies the result will have exactly `size` coefficients, not "at most `size`" coefficients.

2. **No Edge Case Documentation**: Unlike the `cutdeg` method which explicitly states "If `deg` is greater than the current degree a copy of the current series is returned", the `truncate` method lacks any documentation about what happens when `size > len(coef)`.

3. **Misleading Contract**: The phrase "Reduce the series to length `size`" implies an action that results in a specific length, not a conditional truncation.

4. **Comparison with Similar Methods**:
   - The `cutdeg` method (which internally calls `truncate`) has clear documentation about the edge case
   - The `trim` method also has clear documentation about its behavior
   - Only `truncate` lacks this clarity

### NumPy Official Documentation
The official NumPy documentation at numpy.org does not provide additional clarification about this edge case. It uses the same docstring text without addressing what happens when size exceeds the current length.

### Conclusion
The documentation is misleading and incomplete. It promises a specific behavior ("truncate to length size") without documenting the actual behavior (returns unchanged copy when size > current length). This is a clear documentation issue where the implementation doesn't match the documented contract.
