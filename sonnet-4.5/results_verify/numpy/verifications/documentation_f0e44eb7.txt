## Documentation Analysis

### Official NumPy Documentation Findings

1. **numpy.strings comparison functions documentation**:
   - The documentation for `numpy.strings.less`, `numpy.strings.not_equal`, and `numpy.strings.greater_equal` describes their basic functionality as element-wise comparison operations.
   - None of these function documentations mention anything about null character handling.

2. **Critical Documentation - numpy.str_ behavior**:
   - The official NumPy documentation at https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.str_ **explicitly states** that `numpy.str_` "strips trailing null codepoints".
   - This is demonstrated with an example in the documentation:
     ```python
     >>> s = np.str_("abc\x00")
     >>> s
     'abc'
     ```

3. **Unicode String Dtype Documentation**:
   - NumPy uses UCS4 encoded unicode strings for the 'U' dtype.
   - The documentation does not promise that NumPy strings will behave identically to Python strings.

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Documented Behavior**: The stripping of trailing null characters is not a bug - it is explicitly documented behavior of NumPy's string type.

2. **No Violation of Contract**: The comparison functions are working as designed. They compare the actual string values stored in the arrays, which have already had their trailing nulls stripped per documented behavior.

3. **Not a Comparison Function Bug**: The documentation for the comparison functions does not promise to preserve trailing null characters. The null stripping happens at the string storage level, not at the comparison level.

### Conclusion

The behavior described in the bug report is actually **documented and intentional**. NumPy's design decision to strip trailing null characters from strings is clearly stated in the documentation. The comparison operators are functioning correctly by comparing the actual stored values (which have no trailing nulls).
