# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### F2PY F2CMAP Documentation
The NumPy documentation describes the f2cmap mechanism for mapping Fortran types to C types:

1. **File Format**: The f2cmap file must contain a Python dictionary with the structure:
   ```python
   dict(
       <fortran_type>=dict(<kind_selector>=<c_type>),
       ...
   )
   ```

2. **Valid C Types**: The documentation lists these valid C type names (all lowercase):
   - double, float, long_double
   - char, signed_char, unsigned_char
   - short, unsigned_short
   - int, long, long_long, unsigned
   - complex_float, complex_double, complex_long_double
   - string, character

3. **Example**:
   ```python
   dict(real=dict(real64='double'), integer=dict(int64='long long'))
   ```

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **Case Sensitivity of Fortran vs C**:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly state that C type names must be lowercase
   - All examples show lowercase C type names
   - Fortran is case-insensitive (documented elsewhere)
   - C is case-sensitive (general C language property)

2. **Custom Types**:
   - The documentation mentions "users can define their own <Fortran type> to <C type> maps"
   - However, it also states F2PY has "absence of support for user defined types or derived types"
   - The valid C types list appears to be exhaustive, not just examples

3. **Process Documentation**:
   - The `process_f2cmap_dict` docstring states: "It ensures that all **keys** are in lowercase"
   - This explicitly mentions only keys, not values
   - The function validates C types against c2py_map

4. **Implementation vs Documentation Gap**:
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly state whether custom C type names beyond the standard list are supported
   - The documentation doesn't specify case sensitivity requirements for C type names
   - The bug report example uses 'MyCustomType' which isn't in the standard list

## Documentation Interpretation

### What the Documentation Implies
1. F2PY supports mapping Fortran types to a fixed set of C types
2. These C types correspond to the entries in c2py_map
3. The system is designed for mapping Fortran KIND specifiers to standard C types

### What the Documentation Doesn't Say
1. Whether custom C types beyond the standard list are supported
2. Whether C type names must be lowercase
3. How case sensitivity should be handled for C type names

## Conclusion
The documentation is incomplete regarding:
- Whether custom C types beyond the standard list can be used
- Case sensitivity requirements for C type names
- The behavior when non-standard C types are specified

However, based on:
1. The fact that `process_f2cmap_dict` explicitly documents lowercasing only keys
2. C language's case sensitivity
3. The principle that transformations should be minimal and preserve user input where valid

The current behavior of lowercasing C type values appears to be incorrect, even if the documentation doesn't explicitly state this.
