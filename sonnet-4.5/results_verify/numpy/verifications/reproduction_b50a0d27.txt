## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue affects multiple numpy.char functions when handling null bytes (\x00) in strings.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test fails immediately, even on simple cases like searching for a space ' ' in an empty string. The test reveals that numpy.char.find consistently returns 0 for empty strings regardless of the search substring, when it should return -1 (not found).

### Specific Bug Reproductions

All claimed bugs were confirmed:

1. **np.char.find([''], '\x00')**: Returns 0, should return -1
   - The function incorrectly reports finding a null byte at position 0 in an empty string

2. **np.char.find(['a\x00b'], '\x00')**: Returns 0, should return 1
   - The function fails to find the null byte at its actual position (index 1)

3. **np.char.count(['hello'], '\x00')**: Returns 6, should return 0
   - Bizarrely counts 6 null bytes in a 5-character string that contains none

4. **np.char.startswith(['hello'], '\x00')**: Returns True, should return False
   - Incorrectly claims 'hello' starts with a null byte

5. **np.char.rfind(['hello'], '\x00')**: Returns 5, should return -1
   - Returns the string length instead of -1 (not found)

6. **np.char.endswith(['hello'], '\x00')**: Returns True, should return False
   - Incorrectly claims 'hello' ends with a null byte

7. **np.char.index([''], '\x00')**: Returns 0, should raise ValueError
   - Fails to raise the expected exception when substring is not found

### Control Test
The control test with normal substrings (non-null bytes) works correctly:
- np.char.find(['hello world'], 'world') correctly returns 6

### Pattern of Failure
The bug appears to be specifically related to null byte handling. The functions seem to be treating null bytes as C-style string terminators rather than as regular characters in Python Unicode strings. This leads to:
- Empty strings being treated as if they start with a null byte
- Strings being treated as if they end with null bytes
- Incorrect counting of "implicit" null terminators

The bug is severe as it produces completely incorrect results for a valid Unicode character that Python strings handle normally.
