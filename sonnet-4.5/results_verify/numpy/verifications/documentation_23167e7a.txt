# Documentation Analysis

## Official Documentation Review

### numpy.polynomial.Polynomial.roots() Documentation
The official documentation states:
- **Purpose**: "Return the roots of the series polynomial"
- **Description**: "Compute the roots for the series. Note that the accuracy of the roots decreases the further outside the `domain` they lie."
- **Returns**: "Array containing the roots of the series"

### Mathematical Definition of Polynomial Roots
From mathematical sources:
- A root r of a polynomial P(x) is defined as a value where P(r) = 0
- This is a fundamental mathematical definition - roots are solutions to P(x) = 0
- The roots are the x-values where the polynomial function equals zero

## Documentation Assessment

### What the Documentation Promises
1. The method returns "roots of the series polynomial"
2. By mathematical definition, a root r must satisfy P(r) = 0
3. The documentation acknowledges accuracy issues but only mentions domain-related degradation

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say
1. No mention that tiny coefficients might cause complete failure to find valid roots
2. No warning about numerical instability with coefficients spanning many orders of magnitude
3. No mention of coefficient trimming or tolerance parameters
4. No warning that returned values might not actually be roots (i.e., P(r) ≠ 0)

## Numerical Stability Context
From research on polynomial root-finding:
1. Wilkinson's polynomial demonstrates extreme sensitivity to coefficient perturbations
2. Tiny coefficients (e.g., 1e-66) can cause catastrophic numerical instability
3. Companion matrix methods (used by numpy) are particularly vulnerable to overflow/underflow
4. Modern algorithms acknowledge the need for special handling of extreme coefficient ranges

## Conclusion
The documentation implicitly promises that roots() returns actual mathematical roots (values where P(r) = 0). While it mentions accuracy degradation outside the domain, it does not warn that the method can return completely invalid "roots" that don't satisfy the fundamental property P(r) ≈ 0. The bug report correctly identifies a case where the implementation fails to deliver what the documentation promises.
