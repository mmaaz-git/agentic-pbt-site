BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS

I will analyze this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed):
   STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
   - The documentation explicitly states a mathematical property that doesn't hold
   - Lines 591-592 and 683-684 clearly state: "ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2)) == a"
   - This property fails even for Hermitian symmetric inputs
   - The implementation appears to conjugate the result incorrectly
   - Other FFT pairs (fft/ifft, rfft/irfft) correctly implement inverse properties
   - This is not an edge case - it fails for simple, straightforward inputs

2. INVALID (Incorrect report):
   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The test cases correctly demonstrate the failure
   - The documentation does make the claims stated in the bug report
   - The property genuinely does not hold as documented
   NOT AN INVALID REPORT

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - This is a fundamental mathematical property of FFT pairs
   - Users rely on inverse properties for signal processing
   - Not an obscure edge case - fails on basic inputs
   - Data loss occurs (imaginary components lost/conjugated)
   NOT A WONTFIX

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The documentation explicitly promises this functionality
   - This is not requesting new features but reporting broken existing ones
   - The inverse property is documented as currently supported
   NOT A FEATURE REQUEST

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong about code behavior):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - The code consistently behaves differently than documented
   - The implementation may be "working as designed" but documented wrong
   - The issue could be fixed by updating documentation to reflect reality

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The inverse property is a fundamental mathematical expectation
   - Other FFT pairs implement this correctly
   - It's more likely the implementation is wrong than the documentation

   POSSIBLE BUT LESS LIKELY THAN BUG

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

The core issue is that ihfft(hfft(a, n)) returns conjugate(a) rather than a.
This appears to be an implementation bug in how conjugation is handled in the
transform pair.

Looking at the implementation:
- hfft does: irfft(conjugate(a), n)
- ihfft does: conjugate(rfft(a, n))

This double conjugation doesn't properly cancel out, leading to the incorrect
inverse property.

The bug report correctly identifies this as either:
1. A logic bug in implementation
2. A contract/documentation bug

Given that:
- Mathematical FFT pairs should satisfy inverse properties
- Other numpy FFT pairs do satisfy their inverse properties
- The behavior violates user expectations and documented contracts
- Simple test cases demonstrate clear data loss/corruption

This is most appropriately classified as a BUG in the implementation rather
than just a documentation issue. The implementation should be fixed to match
the documented mathematical property.
