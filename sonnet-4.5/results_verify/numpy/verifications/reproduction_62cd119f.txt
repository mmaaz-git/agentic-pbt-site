## Reproduction of numpy.random.gamma Zero Values Bug

### Bug Report Summary
The report claims that numpy.random.Generator.gamma produces exact zero values with very small shape parameters, which allegedly violates the mathematical requirement that the gamma distribution has support (0, âˆž).

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Test Reproduction**
   - Ran the provided property-based test with shape parameters between 1e-10 and 1e-3
   - Test FAILED with shape=0.001, confirming the assertion error
   - The gamma function did produce exact zero values

2. **Manual Reproduction**
   - Tested with shape=0.0009791878680225864 (the specific failing value from the report)
     - Result: 55 out of 100 values were exact zeros
     - Min value: 0.000000e+00
     - Max value: 6.450983e-14

   - Tested with shape=0.001 (the example from the bug report)
     - Result: 55 out of 100 values were exact zeros
     - Min value: 0.000000e+00
     - Max value: 1.213796e-13

### Verification
The bug is reproducible exactly as described in the report. The gamma distribution implementation does indeed produce exact zero values when the shape parameter is very small (around 0.001 or smaller). The non-zero values produced are extremely small (on the order of 1e-13 to 1e-14), suggesting this is likely a floating-point underflow issue where very small positive values are being rounded to zero.

### Effect
When using small shape parameters (< 0.001), approximately 55% of the generated values are exact zeros instead of very small positive numbers. This occurs consistently with the same random seed, indicating a systematic numerical issue rather than a random occurrence.
