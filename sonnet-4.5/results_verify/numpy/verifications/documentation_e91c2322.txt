## Documentation Analysis

### NumPy Documentation Claims:

1. **numpy.char.upper()**: "Calls `str.upper` element-wise"
2. **numpy.char.lower()**: "Calls Python's `str.lower()` on each array element"

Both functions explicitly claim to call the Python string methods element-wise on array elements.

### Python str.upper() and str.lower() Behavior:

According to Python's documentation:
- These methods follow Unicode Standard section 3.13 for case transformations
- They correctly handle characters that expand/contract during case conversion
- Examples: 'ß'.upper() → 'SS', 'ῂ'.upper() → 'ῊΙ'

### Unicode Standard (TR#21):

The Unicode standard explicitly states:
- "Case mappings may produce strings of different length than the original"
- Example given: German 'ß' expands to 'SS' when uppercased
- These transformations are not always reversible

### Documentation vs. Implementation Discrepancy:

The NumPy documentation states that char.upper() and char.lower() call Python's str methods element-wise. However, the actual implementation:

1. **Does NOT behave identically to Python's str methods** - It truncates results based on the array's dtype
2. **Violates the "element-wise" claim** - Element-wise operation should mean applying the exact Python method to each element and preserving the full result
3. **Causes data loss** - Characters are silently truncated when the dtype is insufficient

### Key Finding:

The documentation creates a reasonable expectation that numpy.char functions will produce the same results as Python's string methods applied to each element. The actual behavior violates this documented contract when:
- The string dtype is too small to hold the expanded result
- Unicode characters have complex case mappings that change string length

### Documentation Clarity:

The documentation does not mention:
- That results may be truncated based on array dtype
- That Unicode characters expanding during case transformation may lose data
- Any differences from Python's str.upper()/str.lower() behavior
- That the "element-wise" operation is subject to dtype constraints

The documentation is misleading because it claims to call Python's methods but produces different results.
