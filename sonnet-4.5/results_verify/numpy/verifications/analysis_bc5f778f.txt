TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==============

Analyzing the bug report against each possible triage category:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect):
   Arguments against INVALID:
   - The Wald distribution is mathematically defined only for positive values
   - Wikipedia and mathematical references clearly state support is (0, ∞)
   - The function produces negative values, which violates mathematical definition
   - This is not a matter of interpretation - it's a mathematical fact

   Arguments for INVALID:
   - NumPy's documentation doesn't explicitly state outputs must be positive
   - Could argue documentation doesn't specify this constraint

   Conclusion: NOT INVALID - The mathematical definition is clear even if NumPy docs aren't

2. WONTFIX (Bug is trivial/uninteresting):
   Arguments for WONTFIX:
   - Only occurs with extreme parameters (scale=1e-10)
   - Users rarely use such small scale values in practice
   - Could be considered a numerical precision edge case

   Arguments against WONTFIX:
   - 60% of values are negative in the test case - not a rare occurrence
   - Violates fundamental mathematical properties of the distribution
   - Could lead to serious errors in scientific/statistical applications
   - Users working with small scale parameters have valid use cases

   Conclusion: NOT WONTFIX - Too significant to ignore

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality):
   Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could frame as "add support for extreme parameter values"
   - NumPy might not have intended to support such small scales

   Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The function accepts these parameters without error
   - This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
   - The mathematical distribution is defined for all positive parameters

   Conclusion: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is a correctness issue, not a new feature

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong/unclear):
   Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - NumPy docs don't explicitly state output must be positive
   - Could update docs to warn about numerical issues with small scales
   - Could document the support as (0, ∞) more clearly

   Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code behavior is wrong, not just the documentation
   - Even if docs were updated, the negative values would still be incorrect
   - This is a implementation bug, not a documentation issue

   Conclusion: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code needs fixing, not just docs

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   Arguments for BUG:
   - Violates mathematical definition of Wald distribution
   - Produces impossible values (negative) for a strictly positive distribution
   - Affects 60% of generated values in the test case
   - Could cause serious errors in downstream calculations
   - The distribution is well-defined mathematically for these parameters
   - Numerical instability should be handled, not produce invalid results

   Arguments against BUG:
   - None substantial - this is clearly incorrect behavior

   Conclusion: THIS IS A BUG

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
================
This is a clear BUG. The numpy.random.wald function produces mathematically
impossible negative values when it should only produce positive values. This
violates the fundamental mathematical definition of the Wald/Inverse Gaussian
distribution, which has support (0, ∞). The issue affects a majority of
generated values (60%) with certain parameter combinations, making it a
significant correctness problem that should be fixed.
