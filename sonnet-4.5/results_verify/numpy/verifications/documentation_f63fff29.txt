## Documentation Analysis for removespaces

### Function Location
The `removespaces` function is located in numpy/f2py/crackfortran.py, which is part of the F2PY (Fortran to Python) module in NumPy. This module is responsible for parsing Fortran code and generating Python interfaces.

### Documentation Found
1. **No explicit documentation**: The function `removespaces` has no docstring. There is no formal documentation describing what types of whitespace it should remove.

2. **Function name implication**: The function name `removespaces` suggests it removes spaces (ASCII 32), not all whitespace characters. However, the naming alone is not formal documentation.

3. **Code context**: The function is used internally in the crackfortran module for processing Fortran entity declarations. It's called in conjunction with `markinnerspaces` which replaces spaces within quotes with "@_@" markers.

4. **Actual implementation**: The function calls `expr.strip()` at the beginning, which by Python's definition removes ALL leading and trailing whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns, etc.), not just spaces.

5. **Usage pattern**: The function is used in line 1691 in the context:
   ```python
   removespaces(markinnerspaces(e))
   ```
   This suggests it's meant to normalize spacing in Fortran expressions after protecting quoted spaces.

### Key Observations
- There is NO specification about whether the function should only remove spaces or all whitespace
- The function name suggests space removal, but the implementation removes all whitespace via `strip()`
- The function is internal to F2PY and not part of NumPy's public API
- There are no tests or documentation that specify the expected behavior for non-space whitespace

### Conclusion
Without explicit documentation stating what whitespace characters should be removed, the behavior is undefined/unspecified. The function name suggests "spaces" but doesn't explicitly exclude other whitespace. This is an internal utility function with no formal specification.
