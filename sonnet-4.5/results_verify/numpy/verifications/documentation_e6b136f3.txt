Documentation Analysis
======================

After reviewing the numpy.char documentation and comparing with Python's standard library documentation:

1. numpy.char Function Documentation Claims:
   - numpy.char.upper: "Calls :meth:`str.upper` element-wise"
   - numpy.char.capitalize: "Calls :meth:`str.capitalize` element-wise"
   - numpy.char.title: "Calls :meth:`str.title` element-wise"
   - numpy.char.swapcase: "Calls :meth:`str.swapcase` element-wise"

   All four functions explicitly state they call the corresponding Python str methods element-wise.

2. Python str Method Behavior:
   - Python's str.upper() follows the Unicode Standard for case conversion
   - The Unicode Standard defines that certain characters expand when converted to uppercase
   - For example, ß (U+00DF) uppercases to 'SS' according to Unicode rules
   - Python correctly implements this: 'ß'.upper() returns 'SS' (length 2)

3. Documentation Contract Violation:
   - The numpy documentation creates an explicit contract: these functions "call str.method element-wise"
   - This means each element should behave exactly as if str.method() was called on it
   - There are NO documented limitations or caveats about Unicode handling
   - There are NO warnings about characters that expand during case conversion
   - The documentation does not mention any differences from Python's str methods

4. Additional Documentation Notes:
   - The documentation mentions locale-dependency for 8-bit strings, but this is unrelated to the Unicode issue
   - The examples only show ASCII characters, providing no guidance on Unicode behavior
   - The "See Also" sections reference Python's str methods, reinforcing the expectation of equivalent behavior

5. Conclusion:
   The documentation explicitly states these functions call Python's str methods element-wise. There is no mention of limitations with Unicode character expansion. The actual behavior (truncating expanded characters) directly contradicts the documented behavior. This is a clear contract violation where the implementation does not match the documented specification.

The documentation would need to either:
   a) Be updated to clarify the limitation with expanding characters, OR
   b) The implementation should be fixed to match the documented behavior

Since the documentation makes an unqualified claim about calling str methods element-wise, users rightfully expect identical behavior to Python's str methods.
