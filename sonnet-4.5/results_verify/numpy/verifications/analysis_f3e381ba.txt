## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments for:**
1. **Clear functionality mismatch**: Fortran-ordered arrays are contiguous in memory but are rejected
2. **Documentation contradiction**: NumPy docs explicitly state both C and Fortran orders are "contiguous, single-segment, memory layouts"
3. **Incorrect implementation logic**: The code conflates "has explicit strides" with "is non-contiguous"
4. **Real-world impact**: Users working with Fortran libraries or column-major data cannot use as_ctypes()
5. **Reasonable expectation**: Since F-contiguous arrays are just as valid as C-contiguous arrays, users would reasonably expect them to work
6. **Bug is in core functionality**: This affects the primary purpose of the function - converting arrays to ctypes

**Arguments against:**
- None found. This appears to be a clear bug.

### INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- Could argue the function was only intended for C-contiguous arrays

**Arguments against:**
- No documentation states this restriction
- The error message says "strided arrays not supported", not "only C-contiguous arrays supported"
- Both array types are contiguous, so rejecting one is inconsistent

### WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- Could be considered an edge case if very few users use Fortran-ordered arrays

**Arguments against:**
- Fortran-ordered arrays are a core NumPy feature, not an obscure edge case
- NumPy explicitly provides functions like asfortranarray()
- Scientific computing often involves Fortran libraries
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Could argue that supporting F-contiguous arrays is a new feature

**Arguments against:**
- The function claims to accept "anything that exposes the __array_interface__"
- F-contiguous arrays do expose __array_interface__
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities
- The error suggests non-contiguous arrays are rejected, but F-contiguous arrays ARE contiguous

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- Could update docs to say "only C-contiguous arrays supported"

**Arguments against:**
- The current behavior contradicts NumPy's own definition of contiguous arrays
- Fixing the documentation would be accepting incorrect behavior
- The implementation is buggy (checking strides incorrectly), not the documentation
- Users would still reasonably expect F-contiguous arrays to work

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation incorrectly rejects Fortran-ordered arrays by misinterpreting the presence of explicit strides as indicating non-contiguity. Both C-ordered and F-ordered arrays are contiguous memory layouts according to NumPy's own documentation, so both should be accepted by as_ctypes().
