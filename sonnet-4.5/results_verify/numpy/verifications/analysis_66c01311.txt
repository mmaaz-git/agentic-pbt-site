# Bug Triage Analysis

## Consideration for Each Classification

### 1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code clearly lowercases ALL content including values, not just keys
- The `process_f2cmap_dict` function already handles key lowercasing correctly
- The `process_f2cmap_dict` docstring explicitly states it lowercases "keys" not "keys and values"
- C is case-sensitive, so C type names should preserve case
- Fortran is case-insensitive, so Fortran type names should be lowercased
- The bug breaks the separation of concerns - `load_f2cmap_file` shouldn't modify data that `process_f2cmap_dict` is responsible for processing
- The fix is trivial and clear - just remove `.lower()`

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The example uses 'MyCustomType' which isn't in the standard C types list anyway
- All standard C types in c2py_map are lowercase, so the bug doesn't affect normal usage
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise custom C types are supported

### 2. INVALID (Incorrect report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- F2PY only supports a fixed set of C types listed in c2py_map
- 'MyCustomType' would never be valid even without the lowercasing
- The documentation shows all C types in lowercase
- The system might be designed to only work with standard lowercase C types

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code IS incorrectly lowercasing values when it shouldn't
- Even if custom types aren't supported, the lowercasing is still architecturally wrong
- The bug report correctly identifies a code defect, even if the use case isn't supported

### 3. WONTFIX (Valid but unimportant)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Only affects non-standard C types which aren't officially supported
- All standard C types work fine with the current implementation
- No real-world impact since custom C types aren't in c2py_map anyway
- The bug has likely existed for years without causing problems

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (remove `.lower()`)
- The code is architecturally incorrect regardless of impact
- Future extensions might want to support custom C types

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The user wants to use custom C types like 'MyCustomType'
- This functionality isn't currently supported (types must be in c2py_map)
- The request is really about extending F2PY to support custom C types

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug report identifies an actual code defect (incorrect lowercasing)
- The issue isn't about adding new functionality but fixing incorrect behavior
- The lowercasing bug exists regardless of whether custom types are supported

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't clearly state that only standard C types are supported
- The documentation doesn't specify case sensitivity requirements
- Users might reasonably expect custom C types to work

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- There IS an actual code bug (incorrect lowercasing)
- The documentation issue is secondary to the code defect
- Fixing the documentation wouldn't address the architectural incorrectness

## Analysis Summary

The bug report correctly identifies a real code defect where `load_f2cmap_file` inappropriately lowercases the entire file content including C type values. This is architecturally incorrect because:

1. `process_f2cmap_dict` is already responsible for lowercasing keys
2. The docstring explicitly states only keys should be lowercased
3. C type names should preserve case sensitivity
4. The current implementation violates separation of concerns

While the specific example ('MyCustomType') wouldn't work anyway due to validation against c2py_map, the lowercasing behavior is still incorrect. The fact that it doesn't affect standard usage (all standard C types are lowercase) doesn't make it correct code.

## Recommendation

This should be classified as **BUG** because:
1. The code contains a clear defect (inappropriate lowercasing)
2. The behavior contradicts the documented intent of process_f2cmap_dict
3. The fix is trivial and improves code correctness
4. Even though the impact is limited, incorrect code should be fixed
