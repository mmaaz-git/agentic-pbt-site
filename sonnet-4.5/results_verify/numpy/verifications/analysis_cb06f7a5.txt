## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report could be considered invalid if we argue that numpy.strings.slice is not required to exactly match Python's slice object behavior in all edge cases. The documentation says it behaves "like" Python's slice object, not "exactly as" Python's slice object. Additionally, one could argue that explicitly passing None as a stop parameter is an unusual use case that falls outside normal expected usage patterns, and the current behavior of treating it as "start only" is a reasonable interpretation.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states the function should behave "like in the regular Python slice object", and Python's slice object clearly distinguishes between slice(2) and slice(2, None). The test cases demonstrate real, reproducible failures where the function produces incorrect results compared to standard Python slicing. The behavior is objectively different from Python's slice semantics, making this a valid discrepancy.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be marked as WONTFIX if the maintainers consider this an edge case that rarely occurs in practice. Most users probably don't explicitly pass None as the stop parameter - they either omit it entirely or provide an actual value. Fixing this would require changing the function signature (as suggested with a sentinel value), which could be considered too disruptive for such a minor edge case. The workaround is simple: users can avoid passing None explicitly.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue affects fundamental slicing behavior and violates the principle of least surprise. Users familiar with Python's slicing would reasonably expect slice(arr, 2, None) to mean "slice from index 2 to the end", not "slice up to index 2". This is not just a cosmetic issue but a functional bug that produces incorrect results. The fact that it's an edge case doesn't diminish that it's wrong behavior.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
One could argue that the documentation should be updated to explicitly state that passing None as the stop parameter will cause the start to be interpreted as stop. This would document the current behavior rather than fixing the code. The documentation could clarify that unlike Python's slice object, this function cannot distinguish between omitted and explicitly-None parameters due to Python's function parameter limitations.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation promises behavior "like the regular Python slice object", and changing the documentation to describe different behavior would be admitting the function doesn't work as originally intended. Users rely on NumPy functions to follow Python conventions where applicable. Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it correct, and this is clearly a case where the implementation fails to match the documented intent.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could frame this as a request for a new feature: the ability to distinguish between omitted parameters and explicitly-passed None values. The current implementation limitation is due to Python's default parameter mechanism, and adding this capability would be enhancing the function beyond its current design. The suggested fix with a sentinel value could be seen as adding new functionality rather than fixing a bug.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not asking for new functionality but for the function to work as already documented. The documentation already claims the function behaves like Python's slice object, which inherently includes the ability to handle slice(2, None) correctly. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding something new. The function fails to implement its specified behavior.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function demonstrably produces incorrect results that violate both Python's slicing semantics and the function's own documentation. The documentation explicitly states it should behave "like the regular Python slice object", but it fails to do so when stop=None is explicitly passed. The reproduction shows systematic failures across hundreds of test cases. The behavior is objectively wrong: slice(arr, 0, None) should return the full string from index 0 to the end, not an empty string. This is a clear logic error in the implementation.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
One could argue this is more of a design limitation than a bug. The function works correctly for the common use cases shown in the documentation examples. The issue only occurs in the specific edge case of explicitly passing None, which might not have been considered in the original design. The documentation examples don't show this case, so it could be considered unspecified behavior rather than incorrect behavior.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate bug. The function's documentation explicitly promises behavior "like the regular Python slice object", and Python's slice object unambiguously treats slice(2, None) as "slice from 2 to the end", not as "slice up to 2". The current implementation cannot distinguish between slice(arr, 2) and slice(arr, 2, None) due to how it handles default parameters, resulting in incorrect behavior for the latter case.

The reproduction clearly demonstrates that when stop=None is explicitly passed, the function produces wrong results compared to Python's standard slicing. This is not a matter of interpretation or edge case handling - it's objectively incorrect behavior that violates the documented contract. The fact that hundreds of test cases fail systematically proves this is a real issue.

While the suggested fix using a sentinel value might seem like an implementation detail, the core issue is that the function fails to implement its documented behavior. This is a bug that should be fixed to match Python's slice semantics and fulfill the documentation's promise. Users who explicitly pass None as the stop parameter have a reasonable expectation that it means "slice to the end", not "treat my start as stop".
