## Bug Reproduction Analysis

**Confirmation:** The bug is reproducible exactly as described in the report.

**Test Results:**

1. **Basic reproduction (gdict only, no ldict):** CRASHES
   - Calling `np.bmat('A,B', gdict={'A': A, 'B': B})` raises TypeError
   - Error message: "'NoneType' object is not subscriptable"
   - This matches exactly what the bug report claims

2. **With both ldict and gdict:** WORKS
   - When both dictionaries are provided, the function works correctly
   - This shows the function itself is not fundamentally broken

3. **With empty ldict and gdict:** WORKS
   - Calling `np.bmat('A,B', ldict={}, gdict={'A': A, 'B': B})` works correctly
   - This demonstrates that providing an empty dictionary for ldict avoids the crash
   - The function correctly falls back to gdict when ldict doesn't contain the variable

4. **Mixed variables (some in ldict, some in gdict):** WORKS
   - The function correctly searches ldict first, then falls back to gdict
   - This is the intended behavior according to the code structure

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The crash occurs in the `_from_string` function at line 1030:
```python
thismat = ldict[col]  # This line crashes when ldict is None
```

The issue is in the `bmat` function at lines 1104-1105:
```python
else:
    glob_dict = gdict
    loc_dict = ldict  # ldict can be None here!
```

When `gdict` is provided but `ldict` is not (None by default), the code passes None to `_from_string`, which then tries to subscript None like a dictionary, causing the TypeError.

**Expected Behavior:**

Based on the documentation stating both parameters are optional, and the fact that providing an empty dict for ldict works correctly, users would reasonably expect that:
- Providing only `gdict` should work without needing to also provide `ldict`
- The function should treat a missing `ldict` the same as an empty `ldict`

The proposed fix (`loc_dict = ldict if ldict is not None else {}`) would make this work as expected.
