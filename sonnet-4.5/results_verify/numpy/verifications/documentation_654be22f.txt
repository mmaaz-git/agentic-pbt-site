Documentation Analysis for numpy.base_repr
==========================================

Based on the official NumPy documentation and the built-in help, the function numpy.base_repr has the following specification:

Function Signature:
numpy.base_repr(number, base=2, padding=0)

Key Documentation Statement about padding parameter:
"padding : int, optional
    Number of zeros padded on the left. Default is 0 (no padding)."

This statement is clear and unambiguous: the padding parameter specifies the "Number of zeros padded on the left." This means that if padding=N, then exactly N zeros should be added to the left of the string representation.

Examples from Documentation:
- np.base_repr(7, base=5, padding=3) returns '00012'
  This shows that with padding=3, three zeros are added to the left: '000' + '12' = '00012'

The documentation does NOT say:
- "Minimum length of the result"
- "Pad to a total length"
- "Add padding unless the result is already long enough"

The documentation DOES say:
- "Number of zeros padded on the left" - This is an exact count of zeros to add

Interpretation:
The documentation clearly states that padding specifies the exact number of zeros to add on the left side. This is not about ensuring a minimum length or conditional padding. It's about adding exactly that many zeros to the left of whatever the base representation is.

The behavior should be consistent: padding=1 means add exactly 1 zero to the left, regardless of what the number is or what its base representation looks like.

The example in the documentation (np.base_repr(7, base=5, padding=3) = '00012') confirms this interpretation - exactly 3 zeros are added to the left of '12' (which is 7 in base 5).
