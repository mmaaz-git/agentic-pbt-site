DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Official Documentation Status:
   - NBitBase is officially documented as DEPRECATED since NumPy 2.3
   - The class docstring in _nbit_base.py clearly states: ".. deprecated:: 2.3"
   - The online documentation at numpy.org confirms the deprecation with the note:
     "Deprecated since version 2.3: Use @typing.overload or a TypeVar with a scalar-type as upper bound, instead."

2. Intent Behind Deprecation (from Release Notes):
   - NBitBase was deprecated because its original use pattern became problematic
   - NumPy 2.2.0 changes to float64 and complex128 made static type-checkers reject code using NBitBase as a generic upper bound
   - The recommended alternatives are explicit @typing.overload decorators or TypeVars with scalar-type bounds

3. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:
   - Users should receive a deprecation warning when using NBitBase
   - The warning should inform them to use alternatives (@typing.overload or TypeVar)
   - The deprecation warning is documented in the code itself (lines 173-184 of numpy/typing/__init__.py)

4. Implementation Intent:
   - The __getattr__ function in numpy/typing/__init__.py (lines 172-184) explicitly checks for "NBitBase" and issues a DeprecationWarning
   - The warning message matches the documentation: tells users to use @typing.overload or TypeVar instead
   - The comment states "Deprecated in NumPy 2.3, 2025-05-01"

5. Contract Expectations:
   - When a feature is marked as deprecated in documentation, users expect to receive runtime warnings
   - This is standard Python practice for deprecation workflows
   - The code INTENDS to show this warning (as evidenced by the __getattr__ implementation)
   - The documentation and code comments establish a clear contract that warnings should be shown

6. Documentation Consistency:
   - The deprecation is consistently documented across:
     a) The NBitBase class docstring
     b) The online NumPy documentation
     c) The NumPy 2.3 release notes
     d) The __getattr__ warning implementation
   - All sources agree that NBitBase is deprecated and users should be warned

Conclusion: The documentation clearly establishes that NBitBase is deprecated and that users should receive a deprecation warning when using it. The current behavior (no warning) violates the documented and intended deprecation contract.
