## Triage Analysis for numpy.ma.intersect1d Bug Report

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)
**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**
- The documentation explicitly states "Masked values are considered equal one to the other"
- This creates a clear contract that all masked values should be treated as identical
- The implementation violates this contract by returning multiple masked values
- The behavior is inconsistent with the mathematical definition of set intersection when all masked values are equal
- The example in the documentation shows only one masked value in the result, supporting the expected behavior
- This is a logic error in core functionality, not an edge case

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why this might not be a bug:**
- None. The documentation is unambiguous and the implementation clearly violates it.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why this might be WONTFIX:**
- Could argue that multiple masked values in output provide more information about the input
- However, this directly contradicts documented behavior, so this argument is weak
- Not an obscure edge case - masked arrays are commonly used for missing data

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why this might be a documentation issue:**
- One could argue the documentation should be changed to match the implementation
- However, the documented behavior (treating masked values as equal) is more mathematically consistent
- The current implementation appears to be the bug, not the documentation
- Changing the documentation would break the conceptual model of masked values

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why this might be a feature request:**
- Not applicable. The documented behavior already exists as a specification
- This is about fixing existing functionality to match its specification, not adding new features

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation fails to meet its documented specification in a fundamental way. The documentation explicitly states that masked values are considered equal to one another, which has clear implications for set operations. The current behavior of returning multiple masked values directly violates this equality principle.

The bug appears to stem from a deeper issue in ma.unique() which also doesn't properly deduplicate masked values, causing the problem to propagate through to intersect1d.
