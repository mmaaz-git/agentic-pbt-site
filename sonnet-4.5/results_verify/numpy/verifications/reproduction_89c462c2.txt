## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Test Case Execution

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The bug report's test code runs correctly but the specific failing case mentioned `(2, [0, 0], 1)` appears to have a typo. The test creates a recarray with only 1 field (named 'x'), not 2 fields. The array has 2 elements but only 1 field.

2. **Manual Reproduction**: I ran the exact code from the bug report:
   ```python
   rec_arr = numpy.rec.fromarrays([[0, 0]], names='x')
   rec_arr.field(1)  # Trying to access field index 1 when only field 0 exists
   ```

### Observed Behavior

When calling `rec_arr.field(1)` on a recarray with only 1 field (index 0):
- **Expected error message** (according to bug report): Something like "Field index 1 out of bounds for array with 1 field"
- **Actual error message**: `IndexError: tuple index out of range`

### Confirmation of the Issue

The bug is confirmed. The error message "tuple index out of range" is indeed generic and unhelpful. It doesn't provide information about:
1. Which field index was attempted (1)
2. How many fields are available (1)
3. What the valid range is (0 to 0)

The error appears to come from internal tuple indexing (`names[attr]`) rather than a deliberate validation check, resulting in the cryptic error message.

### Test Results Summary

- The recarray correctly creates with 1 field named 'x'
- Accessing field index 0 works correctly and returns the array data
- Accessing field index 1 (out of bounds) raises IndexError with unhelpful message "tuple index out of range"
- The bug report accurately describes the issue
