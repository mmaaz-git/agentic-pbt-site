## Documentation Analysis

### NumPy Documentation Review

1. **numpy.char.upper(), lower(), swapcase() Documentation**
   - All three functions explicitly state they "call str.upper/lower/swapcase element-wise"
   - numpy.char.upper: "Calls str.upper element-wise"
   - numpy.char.lower: "Calls str.lower element-wise"
   - numpy.char.swapcase: "Calls Python's str.swapcase() for each element"

2. **Critical Documentation Gap**
   The documentation claims these functions call Python's str methods element-wise, but this is misleading. Python's str.upper('ß') returns 'SS', but NumPy returns 'S' when the dtype is insufficient. The documentation makes no mention of:
   - Truncation behavior when case conversion increases string length
   - The dependency on dtype width
   - Potential data loss during case conversion
   - The fact that results may differ from Python's str methods

3. **NumPy String Type Documentation**
   The general NumPy documentation on string types (numpy.str_ / U dtype) does state:
   - Strings are fixed-width data types
   - Strings are "either truncated or zero-padded" to fit the specified width
   - Users must know the maximum string length in advance

   However, this general warning is not connected to the char module functions, and users would not expect automatic truncation during case conversion operations.

4. **Expected Behavior Based on Documentation**
   Given that the documentation explicitly states these functions "call str.upper/lower/swapcase element-wise", a reasonable user expectation would be:
   - The functions should produce the same results as Python's str methods
   - If truncation is necessary, it should be documented or produce a warning
   - The mathematical properties (involution, idempotence) should be preserved

5. **Unicode Standard Compliance**
   The Unicode standard defines proper case mappings where 'ß' → 'SS' is the correct uppercase transformation. NumPy's truncation violates this standard when dtype is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The documentation is misleading. It claims to call Python's str methods element-wise but doesn't mention that results will be truncated based on the array's dtype. This is a significant omission that leads to silent data corruption. The behavior contradicts what the documentation explicitly states.
