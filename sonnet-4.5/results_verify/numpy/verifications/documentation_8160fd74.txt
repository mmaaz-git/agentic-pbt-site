## Documentation Analysis for numpy.bmat

### Official Documentation
The numpy.bmat function documentation states:

**Parameters:**
- `obj`: str or array_like - Input data. If a string, variables in the current scope may be referenced by name.
- `ldict`: dict, optional - A dictionary that replaces local operands in current frame. Ignored if `obj` is not a string or `gdict` is None.
- `gdict`: dict, optional - A dictionary that replaces global operands in current frame. Ignored if `obj` is not a string.

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Both ldict and gdict are marked as optional**: The documentation clearly indicates both parameters are optional with default values of None.

2. **gdict behavior description**: The documentation states gdict "replaces global operands in current frame" and is "Ignored if `obj` is not a string." There is NO mention that gdict requires ldict to also be provided.

3. **ldict special condition**: The documentation mentions ldict is "Ignored if `obj` is not a string or `gdict` is None." This suggests that when gdict is provided (not None), ldict should be used. However, it doesn't say ldict is REQUIRED when gdict is provided.

4. **Examples in documentation**: All examples show either:
   - Using bmat with arrays/lists directly
   - Using bmat with a string where variables exist in the calling scope (no explicit dict parameters)
   - No example demonstrates using gdict parameter alone

5. **Intended behavior from documentation**: Based on the parameter descriptions, a reasonable interpretation is:
   - When a string is passed, bmat should look up variable names
   - If ldict is provided, it should override local scope lookups
   - If gdict is provided, it should override global scope lookups
   - Since both are optional, providing only gdict should be valid

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say

The documentation does not indicate:
- That gdict can only be used when ldict is also provided
- That passing gdict without ldict will cause an error
- Any interdependency between ldict and gdict beyond the note about ldict being ignored when gdict is None

### Conclusion from Documentation

Based purely on the documentation, a user would reasonably expect to be able to pass gdict alone to provide a custom global dictionary for variable lookup. The documentation presents both parameters as independently optional, with no warning about required combinations.
