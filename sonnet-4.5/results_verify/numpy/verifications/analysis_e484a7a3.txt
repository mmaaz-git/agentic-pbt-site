TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for Each Category:

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Why it MIGHT be a BUG:**
- The function violates its documented behavior of acting "Like in the regular Python `slice` object"
- Python's slice(2) and slice(2, None) are different objects with different behaviors
- numpy.strings.slice treats both slice(arr, 2) and slice(arr, 2, None) identically, which is incorrect
- The function cannot distinguish between "parameter not provided" vs "parameter is None"
- This violates the principle of least surprise - developers expect None to mean "no limit"
- The bug makes it impossible to slice from a starting position to the end when using the function directly

**Why it might NOT be a bug:**
- (No valid reasons found - the behavior clearly contradicts documentation)

### 2. INVALID

**Why it MIGHT be INVALID:**
- (Cannot find valid reasons - the test cases are correct and the expectation is reasonable)

**Why it's NOT invalid:**
- The bug report correctly identifies a real discrepancy
- The test case is valid and uses the function as documented
- The expectation aligns with both Python behavior and the documentation

### 3. WONTFIX

**Why it MIGHT be WONTFIX:**
- Users could work around it by passing explicit stop values instead of None
- Could argue it's an edge case

**Why it's NOT wontfix:**
- This is a fundamental API issue, not an edge case
- It affects basic functionality - slicing from position to end
- The workaround requires knowing array lengths, defeating the purpose of None
- It's not an obscure error but a core functionality problem

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it MIGHT be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that supporting None as stop is a "new feature"

**Why it's NOT a feature request:**
- The documentation explicitly states it should work like Python's slice
- Python's slice already supports this behavior
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it MIGHT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to say "None is not supported for stop parameter"
- Could clarify the special case applies whenever stop is None

**Why it's NOT just a documentation fix:**
- The documented behavior ("Like in the regular Python `slice` object") is correct and expected
- Changing documentation would make the API less intuitive and inconsistent with Python
- The code should be fixed to match the documentation, not vice versa

## Final Assessment:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation fails to distinguish between:
1. A parameter not being provided at all
2. A parameter being explicitly set to None

This distinction is crucial in Python and is correctly handled by Python's built-in slice object. The numpy.strings.slice function claims to work "Like in the regular Python `slice` object" but fails to do so.

The bug report is well-documented, provides clear reproduction steps, correctly identifies the root cause, and even suggests an appropriate fix. This is a high-quality bug report for a genuine implementation issue.
