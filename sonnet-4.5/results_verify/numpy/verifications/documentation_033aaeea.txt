## Documentation Analysis for numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer

### Official Documentation Review
I reviewed the official NumPy documentation for `numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer` from multiple sources including the stable version and help documentation.

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Parameter Description**: The `ndim` parameter is documented as "Number of array dimensions" (int, optional)

2. **Valid Values**: The documentation does NOT explicitly specify that ndim must be non-negative. It only states it should be an integer representing the number of dimensions.

3. **Semantic Understanding**: In NumPy and array programming in general:
   - Array dimensions are inherently non-negative quantities
   - The ndim attribute of NumPy arrays is always >= 0
   - A 0-dimensional array is a scalar, 1-dimensional is a vector, 2-dimensional is a matrix, etc.
   - Negative dimensions have no mathematical or programming meaning in the context of arrays

4. **Purpose of ndpointer**: The function creates type objects for ctypes interfacing that validate arrays meet certain criteria before passing them to C functions. The ndim constraint is meant to ensure arrays have the expected number of dimensions.

5. **Error Handling**: The documentation states that "If a given array does not satisfy the specified restrictions, a TypeError is raised" - but this refers to validation when the pointer is used, not when it's created.

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not explicitly state that:
- ndim must be non-negative
- Invalid ndim values should be rejected at pointer creation time
- What constitutes a valid vs invalid ndim value

However, given that:
1. Arrays cannot have negative dimensions (this is a fundamental property)
2. The parameter represents "Number of array dimensions"
3. All examples show positive integers (e.g., ndim=1)
4. The ndim property of actual NumPy arrays is always non-negative

It is reasonable to expect that negative ndim values should be rejected, even if not explicitly documented. The acceptance of negative values and the resulting confusing error messages ("array must have -1 dimension(s)") clearly violate the principle of least surprise and good API design.
