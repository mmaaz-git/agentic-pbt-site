REPRODUCTION OF THE BUG
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report.

TEST RESULTS:
-------------

1. Hypothesis Test with Specific Failing Input:
   - Input: coeffs=[0.0, 1.1125369292536007e-308], n=2
   - Result: Test FAILED with assertion error
   - p**2 produced: [0. 0. 0.] (3 elements)
   - p*p produced: [0.] (1 element)
   - Arrays are NOT equal (shape mismatch)

2. Simple Reproduction:
   - Using Polynomial([0.0, 1e-308]):
     * p**2 coefficients: [0. 0. 0.]
     * p*p coefficients: [0.]
     * Arrays equal: False

   - Using Chebyshev([0.0, 1e-308]):
     * c**2 coefficients: [0. 0. 0.]
     * c*c coefficients: [0.]
     * Arrays equal: False

3. Other Polynomial Classes (as reported):
   - Legendre: p**2 and p*p produce identical [0.] arrays (NO BUG)
   - Hermite: p**2 and p*p produce identical [0.] arrays (NO BUG)
   - HermiteE: p**2 and p*p produce identical [0.] arrays (NO BUG)
   - Laguerre: p**2 and p*p produce identical [0.] arrays (NO BUG)

MECHANISM OF THE BUG:
---------------------

The issue occurs when squaring 1e-308:
- 1e-308 * 1e-308 = 0.0 (numerical underflow)
- This creates a polynomial with all zero coefficients

The key difference is in coefficient trimming:
- The multiplication operator (*) automatically trims trailing zeros, resulting in [0.]
- The power operator (**) does NOT trim, preserving the polynomial structure [0. 0. 0.]

Both polynomials have a trim() method that removes trailing zero coefficients.
When tested: [0. 0. 0.].trim() correctly produces [0.]

MATHEMATICAL EQUIVALENCE:
-------------------------
While the coefficient arrays differ, both polynomials are mathematically equivalent:
- p*p evaluated at any x: 0.0
- p**2 evaluated at any x: 0.0

The bug is in the REPRESENTATION, not the mathematical behavior.

SCOPE CONFIRMATION:
-------------------
The bug report's scope claim is CONFIRMED:
- Affects: Polynomial and Chebyshev classes
- Does NOT affect: Legendre, Hermite, HermiteE, Laguerre classes

The bug occurs exactly as described, with the power operator producing different
coefficient arrays than repeated multiplication due to inconsistent trimming behavior.
