REPRODUCTION RESULTS
====================

The bug report has been successfully reproduced. All test cases work as described:

1. Basic Reproduction Case (";"):
   - Created a matrix with shape (2, 0) and size 0
   - This confirms the bug: a single semicolon creates a 2x0 degenerate matrix
   - The matrix has 2 rows but 0 columns, which is mathematically unusual

2. Additional Test Cases:
   - Empty string "": Creates shape (1, 0) matrix
   - Single space " ": Creates shape (1, 0) matrix
   - Double semicolon ";;": Creates shape (3, 0) matrix

3. Hypothesis Test:
   - The property-based test fails as expected
   - Confirms that the matrix string parser allows creation of matrices with zero-size dimensions
   - The test correctly identifies that input ";" violates the property that all matrix dimensions should be > 0

The bug is real and reproducible. The numpy.matrixlib.matrix function's string parser (_convert_from_string) does indeed accept inputs that create degenerate matrices with zero-size dimensions. This happens because:
- Semicolons are row separators
- Empty strings between/around semicolons become empty rows
- Empty rows are converted to empty lists []
- numpy.array([[], []]) creates a shape (2, 0) array

This behavior is consistent and deterministic, confirming the accuracy of the bug report.
