## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration as BUG:
**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**
1. **API inconsistency**: as_ctypes_type() explicitly supports structured arrays (with examples in docs), but as_ctypes() fails on the same arrays
2. **No documented limitation**: The as_ctypes() documentation says it accepts "anything that exposes the __array_interface__" without mentioning structured array limitations
3. **Clear use case**: Converting structured arrays to ctypes is a legitimate need for C library interoperability
4. **Simple fix available**: The proposed fix is minimal and maintains backward compatibility
5. **Implementation oversight**: The code uses typestr ("|V12") instead of the actual dtype, which appears to be an oversight rather than intentional

### Consideration as INVALID:
**Arguments against (weak):**
1. Could argue that structured arrays were never intended to be supported, but this contradicts the documentation claiming support for "anything that exposes the __array_interface__"
2. The NotImplementedError is technically being raised as documented, but this is for an unexpected case

### Consideration as WONTFIX:
**Arguments against:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - structured arrays are common in NumPy
2. The functionality is clearly useful for C interop
3. The fix is simple and doesn't break existing functionality

### Consideration as FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments against:**
1. This is not asking for new functionality - the documentation implies this should already work
2. as_ctypes_type() already supports structured dtypes, so the infrastructure exists
3. The failure is due to an implementation bug, not a missing feature

### Consideration as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments against:**
1. The code behavior is inconsistent and unintuitive, not just poorly documented
2. Documenting this as a limitation would be inconsistent with as_ctypes_type() supporting the same dtypes
3. The fix is simple enough that changing the code makes more sense than documenting the limitation

### Conclusion:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The as_ctypes() function fails on structured arrays despite:
- No documented limitation
- The sister function as_ctypes_type() supporting them
- A clear use case and user expectation
- The bug being caused by an implementation detail (using typestr instead of dtype)
- A simple, backward-compatible fix being available

The inconsistency between as_ctypes_type() and as_ctypes() is particularly compelling evidence that this is unintended behavior rather than a design choice.
