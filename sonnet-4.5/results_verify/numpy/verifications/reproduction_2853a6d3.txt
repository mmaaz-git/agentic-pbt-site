## Bug Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. Here are the findings:

### Main Bug Reproduction:
When all elements in a 2D masked array are masked and `compress_rowcols` is called:
- **Input**: 2D array with shape (3, 4), all elements masked
- **Result with axis=0**: Shape (0,), ndim=1 - Returns a 1D empty array
- **Expected**: Shape (0, 4), ndim=2 - Should return a 2D array with 0 rows but 4 columns

### Comparison with Partial Masking:
When only SOME rows are masked:
- **Input**: 2D array (3, 4) with 2 rows fully masked, 1 row unmasked
- **Result with axis=0**: Shape (1, 4), ndim=2 - Correctly returns 2D array
- This demonstrates the inconsistency: partial masking preserves dimensionality, complete masking doesn't

### Testing Other Axes:
- **axis=1 (columns)** with all masked: Also returns 1D array shape (0,) instead of (3, 0)
- **axis=1 (columns)** with partial mask: Correctly returns 2D array shape (3, 2)
- **axis=None** with all masked: Returns 1D array shape (0,)

### Verification of Normal Behavior:
- When NO elements are masked: Returns correct 2D shape (3, 4)
- When single row remains: Returns correct 2D shape (1, 4)

### NumPy Standard Behavior:
- Regular NumPy can create empty 2D arrays: shape (0, 4) is valid with ndim=2
- Empty 1D array has shape (0,) with ndim=1
- This shows NumPy supports empty 2D arrays, so returning (0, 4) would be valid

### Technical Correctness:
The bug report is technically correct:
1. The function DOES return inconsistent dimensionality based on whether all or some elements are masked
2. The current implementation explicitly returns `nxarray([])` (1D) when all is masked
3. This breaks the reasonable expectation that a function taking 2D input and removing rows/columns should return 2D output
