## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs when NumPy's char.upper() and char.lower() functions handle Unicode characters that change length during case transformation.

### Reproduction Results:

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test immediately found a failure case with the German eszett ('ß'), which should uppercase to 'SS' and then lowercase to 'ss', but NumPy produces only 's'.

2. **Manual Testing of Reported Case**:
   - Input: 'ῂ' (Greek eta with iota subscript)
   - Python behavior: 'ῂ' → upper: 'ῊΙ' (2 chars) → lower: 'ὴι' (2 chars)
   - NumPy behavior: 'ῂ' → upper: 'Ὴ' (1 char) → lower: 'ὴ' (1 char)
   - Result: Data loss - the iota character is completely lost

3. **Additional Test Cases Found**:
   - German eszett 'ß': Should become 'SS'/'ss', NumPy produces 'S'/'s'
   - Turkish capital İ: When lowercased should become 'i̇' (i with dot), NumPy produces just 'i'

### Root Cause Identified:

The bug is related to NumPy's string dtype system. When char.array() creates an array from a single character string, it defaults to dtype 'U1' (1-character Unicode string). When char.upper() is called:

- If the array dtype is U1, the result is truncated to 1 character
- If the array dtype is U10 (or larger), the full 'SS' is preserved

Example:
```python
arr = np.array(['ß'], dtype='U1')
char.upper(arr)  # Returns 'S' (truncated)

arr = np.array(['ß'], dtype='U10')
char.upper(arr)  # Returns 'SS' (correct)
```

### Impact:

This causes **silent data loss** for any Unicode characters that expand during case transformation. The bug affects:
- German text (ß → SS)
- Greek text with iota subscripts
- Turkish text with dotted/dotless i
- Any other Unicode characters with complex case mappings

The bug is reproducible and consistent across multiple test cases.
