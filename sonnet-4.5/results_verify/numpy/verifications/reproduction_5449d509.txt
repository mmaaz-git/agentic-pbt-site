Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in NumPy's case transformation functions.

## Reproduction Steps Taken

1. **Property-based test reproduction**:
   - Ran the hypothesis test with the failing input ['ẖ']
   - Confirmed that NumPy char.swapcase('ẖ') returns 'H' (single character)
   - Confirmed that Python str.swapcase('ẖ') returns 'H̱' (two characters: H + combining macron below)
   - The assertion fails as expected: numpy_result != python_result

2. **Manual reproduction example**:
   - Verified all test cases from the bug report
   - Character 'ẖ' (U+1E96): NumPy returns 'H', Python returns 'H̱' (H + combining diacritic)
   - Character 'ǰ' (U+01F0): NumPy returns 'J', Python returns 'J̌' (J + combining caron)
   - Character 'ß' (German eszett): NumPy returns 'S', Python returns 'SS' (two S characters)

3. **Extended testing across all functions**:
   - Tested numpy.char.upper: All three test characters show truncation
   - Tested numpy.char.swapcase: All three test characters show truncation
   - Tested numpy.char.capitalize: All three test characters show truncation
   - Tested numpy.char.title: All three test characters show truncation

## Observed Behavior

The bug is systematic and consistent:
- When a Unicode case transformation produces a multi-character result (either through decomposition with combining diacritics or expansion like ß→SS), NumPy truncates the result to the first character only.
- This happens silently with no warning or error.
- The truncation results in loss of information that makes the transformation non-reversible.

## Impact

This is a real bug that causes:
1. Data loss/corruption for certain Unicode characters
2. Inconsistency with Python's standard string behavior
3. Silent failure that could go unnoticed in production code

The bug report's code examples all execute correctly and demonstrate the issue as described.
