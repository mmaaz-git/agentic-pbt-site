## Documentation Analysis for NBitBase Deprecation

### Official NumPy Documentation
1. **NumPy stable docs** confirm that NBitBase is deprecated since version 2.3:
   - States: "Deprecated since version 2.3: Use @typing.overload or a TypeVar with a scalar-type as upper bound, instead."
   - This clearly indicates that NBitBase should trigger a deprecation notice.

2. **NumPy 2.3 Release Notes** confirm the deprecation:
   - NBitBase is officially deprecated in NumPy 2.3
   - Provides migration path using `@overload` or TypeVar
   - References PR gh-28884 as the implementation

### Intended Behavior Based on Documentation
The documentation and release notes make it clear that:
1. NBitBase is deprecated and users should be notified of this
2. A deprecation warning message is expected with specific guidance
3. The exact warning message is documented in the code itself

### NumPy's Deprecation Policy
Based on general NumPy deprecation practices:
- Deprecated features should trigger DeprecationWarning when accessed
- The warning should include guidance on what to use instead
- Deprecation warnings are a standard way to notify users of upcoming API changes

### Code Implementation vs Documentation
The code in `numpy/typing/__init__.py` contains the correct deprecation warning implementation:
```python
warnings.warn(
    "`NBitBase` is deprecated and will be removed from numpy.typing in the "
    "future. Use `@typing.overload` or a `TypeVar` with a scalar-type as upper "
    "bound, instead. (deprecated in NumPy 2.3)",
    DeprecationWarning,
    stacklevel=2,
)
```

This warning message:
- Matches the documentation's recommendation
- Provides clear migration guidance
- Indicates when it was deprecated

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly intends for a deprecation warning to be shown to users when they access NBitBase. The fact that this warning is not triggered is a bug in the implementation, not a documentation error. The deprecation mechanism exists in the code but is bypassed due to the module's import structure.
