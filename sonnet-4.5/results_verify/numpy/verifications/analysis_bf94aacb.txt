BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS

Let me analyze each potential categorization:

1. INVALID - Should this be closed as incorrect?
================================================

Arguments AGAINST Invalid:
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The behavior is genuinely inconsistent (2-D for partial mask, 1-D for full mask)
- Functions named "compress_rows" and "compress_cols" logically should preserve 2-D structure
- All documentation examples show 2-D outputs
- The functions require 2-D input, suggesting a 2-D contract

Arguments FOR Invalid:
- Documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee 2-D output
- Return type is just "ndarray", not "2-D ndarray"
- Could argue that an empty result doesn't need dimensions

Verdict: NOT INVALID - The bug is real and the expectation is reasonable.

2. WONTFIX - Is this too trivial or obscure?
===========================================

Arguments FOR Wontfix:
- Fully masked arrays might be considered an edge case
- Workaround exists (users can check and reshape manually)
- Has existed for a while without many complaints

Arguments AGAINST Wontfix:
- NOT obscure - fully masked arrays can occur naturally in data processing
- Causes actual downstream failures (IndexError when accessing shape[1])
- Inconsistent behavior is a code smell that should be fixed
- Fix is simple and low-risk
- This is a shape contract violation that breaks composability

Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - This is a legitimate inconsistency that affects real use cases.

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Is this asking for new functionality?
==========================================================

Arguments FOR Feature Request:
- Could argue that consistent shape preservation is a "new feature"
- Documentation never promised specific shape behavior

Arguments AGAINST Feature Request:
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The functions already work correctly for partially masked arrays
- This is about consistency, not new capabilities
- The bug breaks expected behavior implied by function names

Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing a bug, not adding features.

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Is this just a documentation issue?
==========================================================

Arguments FOR Documentation Fix:
- Documentation could be clearer about return shapes
- Could document the current behavior as "correct"

Arguments AGAINST Documentation Fix:
- The code behavior is genuinely inconsistent
- Documenting bad behavior doesn't make it right
- The implementation clearly has a bug (returns nxarray([]) unconditionally)
- All examples suggest 2-D output is expected

Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - This is a code bug, not a documentation issue.

5. BUG - Is this a valid bug that should be fixed?
===================================================

Arguments FOR Bug:
- Inconsistent behavior: same function returns different dimensionality based on mask content
- Violates principle of least surprise
- Functions named for 2-D operations should preserve 2-D structure
- Causes real downstream failures when code expects shape[1] to exist
- All documentation examples show 2-D outputs
- Implementation bug is clear: compress_nd returns 1-D array unconditionally when fully masked
- Simple fix available that maintains backward compatibility for correct cases
- Functions explicitly require 2-D input, implying 2-D contract

Arguments AGAINST Bug:
- Documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee shape preservation
- Has worked this way for a while

Verdict: THIS IS A BUG

FINAL ANALYSIS:
==============

This is clearly a BUG for the following reasons:

1. INCONSISTENCY: The functions return 2-D arrays for partially masked data but 1-D for fully masked data. This inconsistency is not documented and breaks expectations.

2. SEMANTIC VIOLATION: Functions named "compress_rows" and "compress_cols" semantically operate on 2-D structures. Returning 1-D arrays violates this semantic contract.

3. IMPLEMENTATION FLAW: The source code shows a clear bug where compress_nd unconditionally returns a 1-D empty array when everything is masked, ignoring the axis parameter and input dimensions.

4. PRACTICAL IMPACT: This causes real failures in downstream code that expects consistent dimensionality, particularly when accessing shape[1].

5. REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS: Given that these functions require 2-D input and all examples show 2-D output, users reasonably expect 2-D output.

The proposed fix is correct and maintains the proper shape contract while being backward compatible for all non-buggy cases.
