## Triage Analysis for numpy.lib.scimath.power Bug Report

### Consideration for Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function returns inf+nanj when mathematically the result should be inf or inf+0j
- The documentation example shows that even powers of negative numbers should have valid imaginary parts (0j), not NaN
- Regular numpy.power() handles the same calculation correctly, returning inf without NaN
- The function's stated purpose is to provide mathematically valid results in the complex domain
- NaN in the imaginary part is not a mathematically correct result for (-1e-200)^(-2)
- The issue is reproducible and consistent across different small negative values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is an extreme edge case involving underflow to zero followed by division
- The behavior might be considered a known limitation of complex arithmetic

#### 2. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- This only occurs in extreme underflow/overflow scenarios (x < ~1e-155)
- Most practical applications wouldn't encounter numbers this small
- The workaround is simple: use regular numpy.power for even integer powers
- Fixing this might require special case handling that complicates the code

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function's purpose is specifically to handle negative bases correctly
- The documentation examples imply valid complex results should be returned
- It's not just a cosmetic issue - NaN propagates and can break downstream calculations
- Other values work correctly, showing this is fixable

#### 3. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee behavior for overflow/underflow cases
- Complex arithmetic with extreme values might be undefined behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation example clearly shows even powers should have valid imaginary parts
- Mathematically, the result is well-defined (positive infinity)
- Regular numpy.power handles this correctly, showing it's not inherently impossible
- The function exists specifically to handle negative bases properly

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be seen as requesting enhanced overflow handling
- The current implementation works for most cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The function already claims to handle negative bases in complex domain
- It's a correction of existing behavior, not a new feature

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could specify overflow/underflow limitations
- Could document that extreme values might produce NaN

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation example implies valid results should be returned
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue
- The mathematical result is well-defined

### Analysis Summary

The core issue is that scimath.power returns inf+nanj for calculations that should yield inf or inf+0j. This happens when:
1. A small negative number (< ~1e-155) is raised to a negative even power
2. The intermediate calculation underflows to complex zero
3. Division by complex zero produces inf+nanj instead of inf

The bug violates the implicit contract shown in the documentation where:
- Example: np.emath.power([-2, 4], 2) returns array([4.-0.j, 16.+0.j])
- This establishes that imaginary parts should be valid numbers, not NaN

### Recommendation

This should be classified as **BUG** because:

1. **Mathematical Incorrectness**: The result inf+nanj is mathematically wrong. (-1e-200)^(-2) = 1e+400 = inf, which is real and positive.

2. **Documentation Consistency**: The documentation examples show that even powers of negative numbers should have 0j imaginary parts, not NaN.

3. **Comparison with numpy.power**: Regular numpy.power handles this correctly (returns inf), proving it's fixable.

4. **Function Purpose**: scimath.power exists specifically to handle negative bases correctly by converting to complex domain. Returning NaN defeats this purpose.

5. **Impact**: NaN propagates through calculations, potentially breaking user code in non-obvious ways.

The proposed fix in the bug report (detecting even integer powers and avoiding complex conversion) is reasonable and would resolve the issue without affecting normal use cases.
