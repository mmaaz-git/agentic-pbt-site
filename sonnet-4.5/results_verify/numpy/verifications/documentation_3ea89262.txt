DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Official NumPy Documentation for numpy.matrix:
   - States: "If `data` is a string, it is interpreted as a matrix with commas or spaces separating columns, and semicolons separating rows."
   - Provides example: np.matrix('1 2; 3 4') creates a 2x2 matrix
   - No explicit specification about handling empty strings or degenerate matrices
   - No statement about minimum dimension requirements or prohibition of zero-size dimensions

2. Source Code Documentation (_convert_from_string function):
   - No docstring or comments explaining intended behavior for edge cases
   - The function simply splits by semicolons for rows and commas/spaces for columns
   - Only validation: checks that all rows have the same number of columns
   - No validation for empty rows or zero-dimension matrices

3. Matrix Class Documentation:
   - States matrix is a "specialized 2-D array"
   - Notes the class is deprecated and may be removed in future
   - Constructor handles various dimension cases:
     - 0-D arrays are reshaped to (1, 1)
     - 1-D arrays are reshaped to (1, n)
     - But no special handling for arrays with zero-size dimensions

4. Key Findings:
   - Documentation does NOT specify what should happen with empty strings
   - Documentation does NOT explicitly prohibit matrices with zero dimensions
   - Documentation does NOT state that all dimensions must be > 0
   - The only requirement stated is that rows must have the same size
   - NumPy arrays in general DO support zero-size dimensions (e.g., np.zeros((0, 5)))

5. Implications:
   - The current behavior (allowing zero-dimension matrices) is not explicitly against the documentation
   - The documentation is incomplete/ambiguous about edge cases
   - This appears to be unspecified behavior rather than clearly documented behavior
