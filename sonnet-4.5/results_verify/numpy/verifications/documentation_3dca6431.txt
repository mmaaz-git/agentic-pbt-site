## Documentation Analysis for normalize_axis_tuple

### Official Documentation Review

The documentation for `normalize_axis_tuple` is explicit and unambiguous about exception handling:

1. **Docstring states**:
   - "Raises AxisError If any axis provided is out of range"
   - No mention of OverflowError as a possible exception

2. **NumPy online documentation** (numpy.org/doc/stable):
   - Confirms that AxisError should be raised when any axis is out of valid range
   - Does not document OverflowError as an expected exception

3. **AxisError documentation**:
   - Clearly states: "This is raised whenever an axis parameter is specified that is larger than the number of array dimensions"
   - AxisError is specifically designed to handle invalid axis values
   - Subclasses both ValueError and IndexError for backward compatibility

### Analysis of Documentation Intent

The documentation clearly intends that:
1. ALL invalid axis values should raise AxisError
2. "Out of range" means any axis value that cannot be valid for the given ndim
3. There is no distinction made between "too large to fit in array dimensions" vs "too large to fit in C int"

### Root Cause Investigation

The bug stems from:
- `normalize_axis_tuple` internally calls `normalize_axis_index`
- `normalize_axis_index` is likely a C-implemented function that converts Python ints to C ints
- When Python integers exceed C int range (Â±2^31), the conversion fails with OverflowError
- This OverflowError propagates up uncaught, violating the documented contract

### Documentation Completeness

The documentation is complete and correct in its intent. It promises that ANY out-of-range axis will raise AxisError. The fact that extremely large values raise OverflowError instead is a violation of this documented behavior, not a documentation deficiency.

### Conclusion

This is a clear violation of the documented API contract. The documentation promises AxisError for all out-of-range axes, but the implementation fails to deliver this promise for values outside the C int range. The fix proposed in the bug report (catching OverflowError and re-raising as AxisError) is the correct approach to honor the documented behavior.
