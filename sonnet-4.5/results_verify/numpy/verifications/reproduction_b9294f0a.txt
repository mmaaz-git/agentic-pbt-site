REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed and exhibits the exact behavior reported.

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - The property-based test fails as described
   - Test case: ['ß'] causes the round-trip test to fail
   - nc.lower(nc.upper(['ß'])) returns ['s'] instead of ['ß']
   - This happens because nc.upper(['ß']) truncates 'SS' to 'S' with dtype <U1

2. MANUAL TEST CASE REPRODUCTION:
   All test cases from the bug report were verified:

   a) German eszett (ß):
      - Python: 'ß'.upper() = 'SS' (2 chars)
      - NumPy with dtype <U1: nc.upper(['ß']) = 'S' (truncated)
      - NumPy with dtype <U10: nc.upper(['ß']) = 'SS' (correct)

   b) Turkish İ (I with dot above):
      - Python: 'İ'.lower() = 'i̇' (2 chars: i + combining dot)
      - NumPy with dtype <U1: nc.lower(['İ']) = 'i' (truncated, missing dot)

   c) Ligatures (ﬁ, ﬂ, ﬆ):
      - Python: 'ﬁ'.upper() = 'FI', 'ﬂ'.upper() = 'FL', 'ﬆ'.upper() = 'ST'
      - NumPy with dtype <U1: All truncated to first character only ('F', 'F', 'S')
      - NumPy with dtype <U10: All correct ('FI', 'FL', 'ST')

3. KEY FINDING:
   The truncation occurs silently - no warning or error is raised when the output
   of the case transformation cannot fit in the input array's dtype. This leads
   to data corruption for Unicode characters whose case mappings expand to more
   characters than the original.

4. ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:
   - NumPy preserves the input dtype for the output array
   - When np.array(['ß']) is created, NumPy infers dtype <U1 (1 Unicode character)
   - The upper() function applies Python's str.upper() which returns 'SS' (2 chars)
   - NumPy truncates 'SS' to 'S' to fit in the <U1 dtype
   - This happens silently without any warning

The bug is real, reproducible, and affects real-world text processing for multiple languages including German, Turkish, and any text with ligatures.
