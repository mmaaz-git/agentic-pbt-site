## Documentation Analysis for numpy.rec.format_parser

### Official Documentation Review

1. **format_parser documentation** (numpy.org/doc/stable):
   - The 'names' parameter can be:
     - A comma-separated string (e.g., 'col1, col2, col3')
     - A list or tuple of strings (e.g., ['col1', 'col2', 'col3'])
   - No explicit documentation about whitespace handling
   - No statement that field names must be Python identifiers

2. **Structured arrays documentation**:
   - Field names are strings
   - Field names do NOT need to be valid Python identifiers
   - Empty string field names are replaced with default 'f0', 'f1', etc.
   - No explicit restriction on whitespace or special characters

3. **Empirical Testing Results**:
   - Field names WITH whitespace ARE valid and functional:
     - ' field1' (leading space) works correctly
     - 'field2 ' (trailing space) works correctly
     - '\t' (tab character) works correctly
     - '\n' (newline character) works correctly
   - These fields can be accessed using their exact names, including whitespace

### Key Findings:

1. **Whitespace is Valid**: Numpy explicitly supports field names containing whitespace and special characters. Fields with names like ' field', '\t', '\n' are valid and can be accessed.

2. **No Documentation of Stripping**: There is NO documentation stating that format_parser will strip whitespace from field names. This stripping behavior is undocumented.

3. **Behavioral Inconsistency**: The documentation shows both string and list input formats are supported, but doesn't mention different whitespace handling between them.

4. **Contract Violation**: When a user provides explicit field names as a list (e.g., [' field']), they have a reasonable expectation that these exact names will be used, not modified versions.

### Conclusion:

The current behavior of stripping whitespace from field names provided as a list is:
- Undocumented
- Inconsistent with numpy's support for whitespace in field names
- Breaks the principle of least surprise
- Creates a mismatch between input and output that users cannot predict from documentation
