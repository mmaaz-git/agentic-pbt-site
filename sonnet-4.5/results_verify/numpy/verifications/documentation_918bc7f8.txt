## Documentation Analysis for numpy.strings.multiply

### Official Documentation
The numpy.strings.multiply function documentation states:
- "Return (a * i), that is string multiple concatenation, element-wise"
- The function should perform string repetition/concatenation, repeating each string `i` times
- Negative values in `i` are treated as 0 (yielding empty string)
- Returns an array with the same dtype as input (StringDType, bytes_, or str_)

### Key Observations

1. **No mention of null character handling**: The documentation does not specify any special behavior for null characters ('\x00'). It simply states it performs "string multiple concatenation."

2. **Expected behavior based on description**: The phrase "(a * i)" explicitly references Python's string multiplication operator, which:
   - Handles null characters as regular characters
   - Preserves all characters including nulls
   - Results in a string of length len(a) * i

3. **Python's standard behavior**: Testing confirms Python's built-in string multiplication:
   - '\x00' * 3 = '\x00\x00\x00' (length 3)
   - 'a\x00' * 2 = 'a\x00a\x00' (length 4)
   - All characters, including nulls, are preserved and repeated

4. **NumPy's string handling philosophy**: NumPy generally aims to provide array operations that mirror Python's scalar operations. The documentation's use of "(a * i)" suggests it should behave identically to Python's string multiplication.

5. **No documented restrictions**: There are no documented restrictions on:
   - Character types that can be used
   - Special handling of null characters
   - C-style string termination behavior

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly indicates that numpy.strings.multiply should behave like Python's string multiplication operator. Since Python handles null characters correctly in string multiplication, and the documentation makes no exception for null characters, the current behavior where null characters are stripped or cause empty string returns is inconsistent with the documented behavior.

The function name and description "string multiple concatenation" unambiguously indicate that all characters in the input string should be repeated, not selectively filtered or terminated at null characters.
