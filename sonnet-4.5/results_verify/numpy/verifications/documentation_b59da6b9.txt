DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. numpy.char.str_len Documentation
------------------------------------
The official documentation states:
- "Returns the length of each element in an array"
- "For byte strings, it counts the number of bytes, and for Unicode strings, it counts the number of Unicode code points"

Key observations:
- The documentation explicitly states it counts "Unicode code points" for Unicode strings
- No mention of special handling for null characters
- No mention of C-style string termination behavior
- No warnings about \x00 being treated differently

2. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation
--------------------------------------------
Based on the documentation stating it counts "Unicode code points":
- '\x00' is Unicode code point U+0000 (NULL character)
- It should be counted as 1 code point
- A string '\x00' should have length 1
- A string 'abc\x00' should have length 4

The documentation gives users reasonable expectation that ALL Unicode code points are counted, including U+0000.

3. numpy.char Module Status
----------------------------
Important context from the numpy.char module documentation:
- The module is "considered legacy and will no longer receive updates"
- It has "potential for future deprecation"
- Users are advised to use numpy.strings instead
- Methods are "based on the methods in the Python string module"

This last point is crucial - if the methods are based on Python's string module, they should exhibit Python-like behavior where \x00 is a valid character.

4. Python String Semantics
--------------------------
Python documentation and behavior clearly shows:
- Strings are sequences of Unicode code points
- \x00 (NULL) is a valid character like any other
- Python strings are NOT null-terminated
- len() counts ALL characters including \x00

5. Documentation Gaps
---------------------
The NumPy documentation does not:
- Warn about C-style null termination behavior
- Document any special handling of \x00
- Mention incompatibility with Python's string semantics for null characters
- Provide any rationale for treating \x00 differently

6. Conclusion
-------------
The documentation clearly states the function counts "Unicode code points" without exceptions. Since \x00 is a valid Unicode code point (U+0000), the current behavior contradicts the documented functionality. Users reading the documentation would reasonably expect numpy.char.str_len to count ALL Unicode code points, matching Python's len() behavior.

The fact that the module is based on Python's string module further reinforces the expectation that it should handle strings the same way Python does, including proper handling of null characters.
