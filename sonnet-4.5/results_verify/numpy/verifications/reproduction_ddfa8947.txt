## Bug Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report using multiple test cases.

### Test Case 1: Bug Report's Example
Input: `ma.array([999, 9223372036854775807, 888], mask=[True, False, True])`
- Expected: At most 1 masked value in the unique result
- Actual: 2 masked values in the unique result
- Result: `[-- 9223372036854775807 --]`

The bug is confirmed. The function returns TWO masked values instead of one.

### Test Case 2: Documentation Example
Input: `ma.masked_array([1, 2, 1000, 2, 3], mask=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0])`
- Result: `[1 2 3 --]`
- Number of masked values: 1
- This works correctly because there's only one masked value in the input

### Test Case 3: Same Underlying Data
Input: `ma.array([999, 100, 999], mask=[True, False, True])`
- Result: `[100 --]`
- Number of masked values: 1
- This works correctly because both masked values have the same underlying data (999)

### Test Case 4: Multiple Different Masked Values
Input: `ma.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], mask=[True, False, True, False, True])`
- Result: `[2 4 --]`
- Number of masked values: 1
- This appears to work, but only because np.unique happens to return the underlying values in an order where only one appears masked

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs because:
1. numpy.ma.unique internally calls numpy.unique on the raw data array
2. numpy.unique treats 999 and 888 as different values, returning both
3. The mask is then applied to this result, causing both 999 and 888 to appear as masked values in the output

The hypothesis test confirms this is a systematic issue - when masked values have different underlying data, they are treated as distinct elements rather than as a single masked element.

### Verification of Bug Report Claims

The bug report's analysis is correct:
- The function does violate its documented behavior
- Multiple masked values with different underlying data are returned as multiple masked entries
- The root cause is indeed that np.unique operates on the raw data without considering the mask first
