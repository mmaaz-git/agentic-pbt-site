BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

I have successfully reproduced all the bugs described in the report. The issues are confirmed to exist in numpy.char functions when operations would expand strings beyond their original width.

REPRODUCTION DETAILS:

1. Bug 1: numpy.char.upper() truncates ligatures
   - Input: 'ﬀ' (LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF, U+FB00)
   - Expected (Python's upper()): 'FF'
   - Actual (numpy.char.upper()): 'F'
   - Result: CONFIRMED - The result is truncated to 1 character

2. Bug 2: numpy.char.swapcase() truncates expansions
   - Input: 'ß' (German sharp S)
   - Expected (Python's swapcase()): 'SS'
   - Actual (numpy.char.swapcase()): 'S'
   - Result: CONFIRMED - The result is truncated to 1 character

3. Bug 3: numpy.char.replace() truncates when replacement expands string
   - Input: '0'
   - Operation: Replace '0' with '00'
   - Expected (Python's replace()): '00'
   - Actual (numpy.char.replace()): '0'
   - Result: CONFIRMED - The replacement doesn't occur when it would expand the string

4. Bug 4: numpy.char.translate() truncates when translation expands characters
   - Input: 'a'
   - Translation table: {'a': 'AA'}
   - Expected (Python's translate()): 'AA'
   - Actual (numpy.char.translate()): 'A'
   - Result: CONFIRMED - The translation is truncated to 1 character

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

The dtype investigation confirms the root cause described in the bug report:
- Arrays created with single characters have dtype '<U1' (1-character Unicode string)
- Operations that would expand strings beyond this width are truncated to fit the original dtype
- For example, 'ﬀ' starts as <U1 and remains <U1 after upper(), even though it should become <U2 to hold 'FF'

EFFECT:

This is a significant data loss issue. The functions silently truncate data without warning, leading to:
1. Incorrect results that differ from Python's standard string methods
2. Loss of information during Unicode operations
3. Unexpected behavior that could cause bugs in downstream applications
4. Violation of the principle of least surprise - users expect numpy.char functions to behave like Python's string methods

The bug report's claims are accurate and the reproduction code provided works correctly.
