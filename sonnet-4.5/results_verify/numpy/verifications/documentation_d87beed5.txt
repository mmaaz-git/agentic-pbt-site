## Documentation Analysis

### NumPy Documentation for char.replace

The official NumPy documentation states:
"For each element in `a`, return a copy of the string with occurrences of substring `old` replaced by `new`."

Key points from the documentation:
1. The function should return "a copy of the string with occurrences of substring `old` replaced by `new`"
2. It references Python's str.replace in the "See Also" section, implying similar behavior
3. The examples show normal substring replacement where the pattern exists in the string

### Python str.replace Behavior

Python's documentation for str.replace states it returns "a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new". The key word here is "occurrences" - if there are zero occurrences (e.g., when the pattern doesn't exist or cannot exist), no replacement should happen.

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

Based on the documentation:
- **Expected**: When the search pattern doesn't exist in the string (including when it's longer than the string), the function should return the original string unchanged
- **Actual**: NumPy char.replace incorrectly performs a replacement and returns a truncated result

### Documentation Implications

1. **The documentation does not specify special handling** for cases where the pattern is longer than the string
2. **The documentation implies Python-like behavior** by referencing str.replace in "See Also"
3. **Common sense interpretation**: A substring that is longer than the string cannot exist within it, so no replacement should occur
4. **The examples in the documentation** only show cases where replacements actually make sense (pattern exists in string)

### Critical Finding

The NumPy documentation states the function should behave like Python's str.replace element-wise. The phrase "occurrences of substring `old` replaced" clearly implies that only actual occurrences should be replaced. A pattern longer than the string has zero occurrences, so the string should remain unchanged.

The current behavior violates both:
1. The documented contract (replace occurrences of substring)
2. The implied behavior from the str.replace reference
3. Basic string manipulation logic (you cannot find a 2-character pattern in a 1-character string)

### Conclusion

This is clearly incorrect behavior that violates the documented functionality. The documentation doesn't need to explicitly state "patterns longer than the string won't be replaced" because this is fundamental to the concept of substring replacement - you can only replace what exists.
