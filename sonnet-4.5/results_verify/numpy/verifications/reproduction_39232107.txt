REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the issue. The bug report is accurate.

TEST REPRODUCTION:
-----------------
1. Running the simple reproduction code:
   - Expected: Deprecation warning should be emitted when accessing npt.NBitBase
   - Actual: No warning is emitted
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED

2. Running the Hypothesis-based test:
   - Test fails with assertion error because len(w) == 0 (no warnings)
   - Expected 1 deprecation warning
   - Result: BUG CONFIRMED

SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS:
--------------------
Examining numpy/typing/__init__.py reveals the root cause:

Line 160: NBitBase is directly imported into the module namespace
```python
from numpy._typing import ArrayLike, DTypeLike, NBitBase, NDArray
```

Line 162: NBitBase is included in __all__
```python
__all__ = ["ArrayLike", "DTypeLike", "NBitBase", "NDArray"]
```

Lines 172-184: __getattr__ contains deprecation logic that is never executed
```python
def __getattr__(name: str):
    if name == "NBitBase":
        import warnings
        # Deprecated in NumPy 2.3, 2025-05-01
        warnings.warn(
            "`NBitBase` is deprecated and will be removed from numpy.typing in the "
            "future. Use `@typing.overload` or a `TypeVar` with a scalar-type as upper "
            "bound, instead. (deprecated in NumPy 2.3)",
            DeprecationWarning,
            stacklevel=2,
        )
        return NBitBase
```

The problem: Python's attribute lookup finds NBitBase in the module's __dict__ (because it was imported directly) before __getattr__ is ever called. The __getattr__ method is only invoked when an attribute is NOT found through normal lookup.

FIX VERIFICATION:
----------------
I created a simulation that removes NBitBase from direct import and relies on __getattr__:
- The simulation successfully emits the deprecation warning
- NBitBase is still accessible and returns the correct class
- This confirms the proposed fix would work correctly

IMPACT:
-------
This is a legitimate bug that prevents users from receiving deprecation warnings about NBitBase usage. Since NBitBase is deprecated in NumPy 2.3 and will be removed in the future, users need these warnings to update their code before the breaking change.
