DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Official Documentation Review:

   From the docstring and online documentation:
   - ldict: dict, optional - "A dictionary that replaces local operands in current frame.
     Ignored if `obj` is not a string or `gdict` is None."
   - gdict: dict, optional - "A dictionary that replaces global operands in current frame.
     Ignored if `obj` is not a string."

2. Key Documentation Points:

   a) Both parameters are marked as "optional" with no default values shown in signature
   b) The documentation states ldict is "Ignored if obj is not a string or gdict is None"
   c) The documentation does NOT state that ldict must be provided when gdict is provided
   d) The documentation does NOT state that gdict cannot be used without ldict

3. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:

   According to the documentation, these should work:
   - np.bmat('A') - uses caller's frame (works)
   - np.bmat('A', ldict={'A': matrix}) - uses provided ldict (works)
   - np.bmat('A', gdict={'A': matrix}) - uses provided gdict (FAILS - this is the bug)
   - np.bmat('A', ldict={}, gdict={'A': matrix}) - uses both (works)

4. Documentation Interpretation:

   The phrase "Ignored if obj is not a string or gdict is None" for ldict means:
   - ldict is ignored when obj is not a string
   - ldict is ignored when gdict is None

   It does NOT mean:
   - ldict must be provided when gdict is not None
   - ldict cannot be None when gdict is provided

5. API Contract:

   The documentation establishes that both parameters are optional and independent.
   Users should be able to:
   - Provide neither (use caller's frame)
   - Provide ldict only
   - Provide gdict only
   - Provide both

6. Conclusion on Documentation:

   The documentation clearly indicates both parameters are optional and does not establish
   any dependency between them that would require ldict to be non-None when gdict is
   provided. The current implementation violates this documented API contract.
