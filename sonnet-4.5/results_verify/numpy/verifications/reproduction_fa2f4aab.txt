## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report is CORRECT. The NBitBase deprecation warning never triggers when accessing `numpy.typing.NBitBase` through normal attribute access.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test Execution**:
   - Test FAILED as expected
   - Expected 1 deprecation warning, received 0 warnings
   - The test correctly identifies that no warning is raised

2. **Direct Access Test**:
   - Confirmed that accessing `npt.NBitBase` captures 0 warnings
   - Expected 1 warning, actual 0 warnings

3. **Root Cause Verification**:
   - `NBitBase` exists in `npt.__dict__` (module namespace)
   - `NBitBase` is imported at module level (line 160 of __init__.py)
   - Python's normal attribute lookup finds `NBitBase` in the module's `__dict__` before `__getattr__` is ever called

4. **__getattr__ Direct Call Test**:
   - When calling `npt.__getattr__("NBitBase")` directly, the deprecation warning IS correctly triggered
   - This confirms the deprecation code exists and works, but is never reached during normal attribute access

5. **Attribute Lookup Mechanism**:
   - Python's attribute lookup order: `__dict__` â†’ `__getattr__` (fallback)
   - Since NBitBase exists in `__dict__`, `__getattr__` is never invoked
   - The bug report's proposed fix (importing as `_NBitBase` and removing from direct imports) would correctly route access through `__getattr__`

### Conclusion
The bug is reproducible and the report accurately describes both the problem and its cause. The deprecation warning code exists but is unreachable due to the module-level import bypassing the `__getattr__` mechanism.
