# Documentation Analysis

## Official numpy.matrix Documentation
The numpy.matrix documentation (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.html) provides limited information about the `copy` parameter:
- States: "If `data` is already an `ndarray`, then this flag determines whether the data is copied (the default), or whether a view is constructed."
- Does not explicitly specify behavior for non-contiguous arrays
- Does not guarantee that matrices will be contiguous

## numpy.ndarray Documentation
The numpy.ndarray documentation does not provide explicit guarantees about contiguity when creating arrays from non-contiguous data.

## Observed numpy Behavior
Testing numpy.array shows standard behavior:
- `np.array(non_contiguous, copy=False)` preserves non-contiguity (creates a view)
- `np.array(non_contiguous, copy=True)` creates a contiguous copy
- This is consistent behavior throughout numpy

## Code Intent Analysis
Looking at the dead code in context:
```python
if not (order or arr.flags.contiguous):
    arr = arr.copy()
```

The apparent intent was to ensure arrays are contiguous by copying non-contiguous arrays. However, the logic error prevents this from ever executing.

## Documentation Gaps
1. The numpy.matrix documentation does not specify whether matrices should be contiguous
2. There's no documented requirement that matrices must be contiguous
3. The behavior when creating matrices from non-contiguous arrays is not explicitly documented

## Conclusion
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that matrices should handle non-contiguous arrays in a specific way, the presence of code that attempts to handle this case (even though it's broken) suggests there was an intent to ensure contiguity. The bug is not a documentation issue but rather a clear logic error in the implementation.
