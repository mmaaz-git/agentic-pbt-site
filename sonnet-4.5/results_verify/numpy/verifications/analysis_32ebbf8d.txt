## Bug Triage Analysis

### Category: INVALID
**Arguments Against:**
- The function crashes with AssertionError on unmatched quotes, preventing documented inverse relationship
- Documentation explicitly states insert_quotes is "inverse of eliminate_quotes" with no exceptions mentioned
- The bug prevents property-based testing from working correctly
- No documentation states that input must have matched quotes

**Arguments For:**
- Could argue the function is for parsing Fortran/C expressions which require matched quotes
- All existing tests use properly quoted strings
- Function name suggests it eliminates (complete) quotes, not partial quotes

**Assessment:** Weak case - documentation promises inverse relationship without stating preconditions

### Category: WONTFIX
**Arguments Against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - single quote characters appear in real text
- The error prevents the function from being used as a general string processor
- The fix is simple (remove assertions)

**Arguments For:**
- Function is internal to f2py symbolic parser
- Real Fortran/C code should have matched quotes
- Might be rarely encountered in practice for f2py's use case

**Assessment:** Moderate case if function is purely internal, but it's exposed in public API

### Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments Against:**
- The code behavior (crashing) is clearly wrong for a function that promises to be invertible
- Assertions in code are implementation details, not API contracts

**Arguments For:**
- Documentation could specify that input must have properly matched quotes
- Could document that AssertionError is raised for malformed input
- The inverse relationship could be documented as only valid for well-formed strings

**Assessment:** Strong case - documentation should clarify expected input format

### Category: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation already promises this works (inverse relationship)
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

**Arguments For:**
- Could argue that handling unmatched quotes is a new feature
- Original design may have intentionally required matched quotes

**Assessment:** Weak case - fixing to match documented behavior isn't a new feature

### Category: BUG
**Arguments For:**
- Documentation promises inverse relationship without stating exceptions
- Function crashes instead of handling edge cases gracefully
- Property-based testing reveals the function doesn't handle all valid string inputs
- The assertions are overly restrictive implementation details
- Fix is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality

**Arguments Against:**
- Function works correctly for its intended use case (Fortran/C expressions)
- All existing tests pass
- Unmatched quotes may be considered invalid input for symbolic expressions

**Assessment:** Strong case - documented behavior doesn't match implementation

### Final Analysis

This appears to be either a **BUG** or **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** depending on intent:

1. If the function is meant to handle arbitrary strings (as suggested by generic names and docstrings), then it's a **BUG**

2. If the function is specifically for well-formed Fortran/C expressions only, then it's a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** to clarify input requirements

Given that:
- The documentation promises an inverse relationship without caveats
- The function is in the public API
- The fix is trivial and non-breaking
- Property-based testing is a legitimate use case

The most appropriate classification is **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** because the function works correctly for its intended domain (Fortran/C expressions with matched quotes), but the documentation fails to specify this constraint.
