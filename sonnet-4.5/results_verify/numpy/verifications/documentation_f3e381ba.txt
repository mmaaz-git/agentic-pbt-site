## Documentation Analysis for numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes

### Official Documentation

The function docstring states:
- "Create and return a ctypes object from a numpy array."
- "Actually anything that exposes the __array_interface__ is accepted."

The documentation provides examples but does NOT specify:
- Any restrictions on array ordering (C vs Fortran)
- Any restrictions on strided vs contiguous arrays
- What types of arrays are or aren't supported

### NumPy Array Memory Layout Documentation

According to NumPy's official documentation on arrays:
1. **Both C-ordered and Fortran-ordered arrays are contiguous**: "Both the C and Fortran orders are contiguous, i.e., single-segment, memory layouts."

2. **Contiguous arrays definition**: Arrays are contiguous when they occupy a single, continuous segment of memory where every part can be accessed by some combination of indices.

3. **C_CONTIGUOUS vs F_CONTIGUOUS**:
   - C_CONTIGUOUS: Data in row-major order (last index varies fastest)
   - F_CONTIGUOUS: Data in column-major order (first index varies fastest)
   - Both are equally valid forms of contiguous memory layout

4. **Strides**: All arrays have strides, but the interpretation differs:
   - C-contiguous arrays may report strides=None in __array_interface__ as an optimization
   - F-contiguous arrays explicitly report their strides

### Error Message Analysis

The error message "strided arrays not supported" implies:
- The function intends to reject non-contiguous arrays
- However, it incorrectly conflates "has explicit strides" with "is non-contiguous"

### Documentation Gaps

1. The as_ctypes documentation doesn't specify that only C-contiguous arrays are supported
2. There's no mention that Fortran-ordered arrays would be rejected
3. The term "strided arrays" in the error message is misleading since all arrays have strides

### Conclusion

The documentation does not indicate that Fortran-ordered arrays should be rejected. Since both C-ordered and F-ordered arrays are documented as contiguous memory layouts, the rejection of F-ordered arrays appears to be an implementation bug rather than documented behavior.
