=== BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT ===

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed to exist in numpy.strings.replace.

## Test Results

### Simple Reproduction Case
Input: '00'
Expected (Python's str.replace): 'XXXXXX0'
Actual (NumPy's result): 'XX0'

The bug occurs exactly as described - when replacing '0' with 'XXXXXX' in the string '00' with count=1, NumPy returns 'XX0' instead of the expected 'XXXXXX0'.

### Property-Based Test
The Hypothesis test failed immediately with the exact same case mentioned in the bug report:
- s='00', old='0', new='XXXXXX'
- NumPy result: 'XX0'
- Python result: 'XXXXXX0'

### Root Cause Analysis
Through detailed testing, I confirmed the root cause:

1. Input array np.array(['00']) has dtype '<U2' (2-character Unicode string)
2. The replacement string 'XXXXXX' is cast to dtype '<U2' BEFORE buffer size calculation
3. This truncates 'XXXXXX' to 'XX' (only 2 characters)
4. Buffer size is calculated using truncated 'XX' instead of original 'XXXXXX':
   - Calculated: 2 + 1 * (2 - 1) = 3 characters
   - Should be: 2 + 1 * (6 - 1) = 7 characters
5. Output array is created with dtype '<U3' (only 3 characters)
6. The actual replacement would produce 'XXXXXX0' (7 characters)
7. This gets truncated to 'XX0' to fit in the '<U3' dtype

### Additional Test Case
Testing with '00000' replacing first 2 occurrences of '0' with 'XXXXXX':
- NumPy result: 'XXXXXXXXXX000' (dtype '<U13')
- Python result: 'XXXXXXXXXXXX000' (15 characters)
- Again showing truncation where NumPy only uses 'XXXXX' (5 chars from <U5 dtype) instead of 'XXXXXX' (6 chars)

The bug is 100% reproducible and occurs exactly as described in the report.
