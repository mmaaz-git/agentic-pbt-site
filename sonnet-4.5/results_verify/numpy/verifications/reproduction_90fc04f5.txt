Bug Reproduction Results
========================

REPRODUCTION STATUS: CONFIRMED - The reported behavior is accurate.

TEST RESULTS:

1. Manual testing of the examples provided in bug report:
   - get_period_alias('MS') returns 'M', then get_period_alias('M') returns None ✓
   - get_period_alias('QS') returns 'Q', then get_period_alias('Q') returns None ✓
   - get_period_alias('BQE') returns 'Q', then get_period_alias('Q') returns None ✓
   - get_period_alias('BQS') returns 'Q', then get_period_alias('Q') returns None ✓

2. Hypothesis test from bug report:
   - The test fails as reported
   - First failing example is 'MS' -> 'M' -> None

3. Verification of root cause:
   - Confirmed that OFFSET_TO_PERIOD_FREQSTR does not contain 'M' or 'Q' as keys
   - 'M' in OFFSET_TO_PERIOD_FREQSTR: False
   - 'Q' in OFFSET_TO_PERIOD_FREQSTR: False

TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
- The bug report correctly identifies the behavior
- The root cause analysis is accurate (missing self-mappings in dictionary)
- The examples and test cases are valid and reproduce the issue

BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS:
The function currently behaves as follows:
- First application: Maps offset strings to their period aliases (e.g., 'MS' -> 'M')
- Second application: Returns None for the period aliases since they're not in the dictionary

This is NOT idempotent behavior. For idempotence, we would need:
- get_period_alias('MS') = 'M'
- get_period_alias('M') = 'M' (not None)

The bug reporter's claim about idempotence violation is technically correct from a mathematical perspective. However, whether this is a BUG depends on whether idempotence was an intended property of this function.
