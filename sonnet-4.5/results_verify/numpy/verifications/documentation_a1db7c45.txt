DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR numpy.strings.find

SUMMARY OF DOCUMENTATION:
The official NumPy documentation for numpy.strings.find states that it "Returns the lowest index where a substring is found within each string element, within a specified range." While the documentation does not explicitly state what value is returned when the substring is not found, it notes that the function mimics Python's standard str.find() method, adapted for NumPy array operations.

PYTHON str.find() BEHAVIOR:
Python's built-in str.find() method clearly documents that it returns -1 when the substring is not found. This is explicit in the Python documentation and is the standard behavior that Python developers expect. The method returns the lowest index where the substring is found, or -1 if not found.

IMPLIED CONTRACT:
Since numpy.strings.find is documented as mimicking Python's str.find() for array operations, there is a strong implied contract that it should follow the same return value semantics, including returning -1 when the substring is not found. This is a reasonable expectation for users, even if not explicitly stated in NumPy's documentation.

NULL CHARACTER HANDLING:
Neither the NumPy nor Python documentation mentions any special handling for null characters ('\x00'). In Python's str.find(), null characters are treated as regular characters within strings, and searching for them follows the same rules as any other character.

CONCLUSION:
While NumPy's documentation could be more explicit about the return value when a substring is not found, the documented intent to mimic Python's str.find() creates a clear expectation that -1 should be returned when the substring is not present. There is no documented reason why null characters should be treated differently from other characters.
