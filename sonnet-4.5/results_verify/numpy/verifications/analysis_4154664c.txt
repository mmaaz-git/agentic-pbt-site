BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

CONSIDERATION FOR EACH CATEGORY
================================

1. INVALID
----------
Arguments FOR Invalid:
- IEEE 754 standard defines NaN != NaN, so the current behavior follows the standard
- Documentation doesn't promise reflexivity or equivalence relation properties
- Documentation doesn't specify NaN handling, so current behavior isn't technically wrong
- This is consistent with how basic equality (==) works in NumPy

Arguments AGAINST Invalid:
- Function name "equiv" strongly implies equivalence relation with reflexivity
- Violates principle of least surprise - users expect array_equiv(x, x) = True
- Sister function array_equal provides NaN handling via equal_nan parameter
- The mathematical concept of equivalence requires reflexivity

2. WONTFIX
----------
Arguments FOR Wontfix:
- NaN comparisons are a known edge case in floating point arithmetic
- Users can work around this by checking for NaN separately
- This has been the behavior for a long time without major issues
- Could be considered an obscure edge case

Arguments AGAINST Wontfix:
- Not an obscure case - NaN values are common in scientific computing
- Violates a fundamental mathematical property (reflexivity)
- array_equal already solved this problem with equal_nan parameter
- The fix is straightforward and well-established

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
--------------------
Arguments FOR Documentation Fix:
- Documentation doesn't mention NaN behavior at all
- Could add warning: "Note: Returns False for self-comparison with NaN values"
- Could clarify that it doesn't implement a true equivalence relation
- Users need to know about this limitation

Arguments AGAINST Documentation Fix:
- The behavior itself is problematic, not just the documentation
- Documenting a violation of reflexivity doesn't make it correct
- Other NumPy functions (array_equal) handle this properly in code

4. FEATURE_REQUEST
------------------
Arguments FOR Feature Request:
- Adding equal_nan parameter would be a new feature
- Current behavior might be considered "working as designed"
- Enhancing the function rather than fixing a bug

Arguments AGAINST Feature Request:
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Reflexivity is a basic expectation, not an enhancement
- The function name implies it should work correctly

5. BUG
------
Arguments FOR Bug:
- Violates reflexivity: array_equiv(x, x) should ALWAYS return True
- Function name "equiv" implies mathematical equivalence relation
- Inconsistent with array_equal which provides proper NaN handling
- Violates principle of least surprise
- The proposed fix is reasonable and follows established patterns
- This is a logic error that produces incorrect results

Arguments AGAINST Bug:
- Documentation doesn't explicitly promise reflexivity
- Follows IEEE 754 standard for NaN comparisons
- Has worked this way for a long time

ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================
This is most clearly a BUG because:

1. The function name "array_equiv" strongly implies it tests for equivalence, which
   mathematically requires reflexivity (x ~ x must be true)

2. The violation is not an obscure edge case - NaN values are common in scientific
   computing, and users reasonably expect array_equiv(arr, arr) to return True

3. NumPy already established the pattern for handling this with array_equal's
   equal_nan parameter, showing this is a recognized issue with a known solution

4. The behavior produces logically incorrect results - an array is always equivalent
   to itself by definition, regardless of its contents

5. While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise reflexivity, the function name
   and purpose strongly imply it, and violating this expectation is a bug

The fact that IEEE 754 defines NaN != NaN doesn't excuse the violation of reflexivity
in a function specifically designed to test equivalence. The function should either
handle NaN specially or at minimum recognize when the same object is being compared
to itself.
