## Documentation Analysis

### Public API Status

1. **Module Accessibility**: The `crackfortran` module is exposed through `numpy.f2py.crackfortran` and is accessible as a public import. It shows up in `dir(numpy.f2py)`.

2. **Function Naming**: The `markoutercomma` function does NOT have a leading underscore, which by Python convention suggests it's intended as a public function.

3. **Official Documentation**:
   - NO official documentation found for `markoutercomma` in NumPy's documentation
   - The function has NO docstring
   - NumPy's F2PY documentation focuses on the main `crackfortran` and `crack2fortran` functions, but does not mention `markoutercomma`
   - The module itself is documented as a tool to "read fortran (77,90) code and extract declaration information"

### Function Purpose and Context

Based on source code analysis:
- `markoutercomma` is used internally by other functions in the module: `analyzecommon`, `analyzeline`, and `analyzevars`
- Its purpose is to process Fortran code lines by marking commas that appear outside of parentheses with special delimiters (@,@)
- This is part of the internal parsing machinery for Fortran code

### Expected Behavior

The documentation provides NO specification for:
- What inputs are valid for `markoutercomma`
- How the function should handle malformed input
- Whether unbalanced parentheses are expected to be handled
- What errors, if any, should be raised

### Conclusion

While `markoutercomma` is technically accessible as a public function (no underscore prefix, module is public), it appears to be an internal utility function for the F2PY parser. The lack of any documentation, docstring, or mention in the official docs suggests it's not intended for direct use by end users. It's part of the internal implementation of the Fortran code parser.
