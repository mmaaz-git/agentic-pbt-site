## Triage Analysis for numpy.random.gamma Zero Values Bug

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments For:**
- The behavior is mathematically questionable - most statistical software treats gamma distribution as having support (0, ∞) excluding zero
- This is clearly a numerical underflow issue that could be addressed with better handling
- The behavior could lead to incorrect statistical analyses where log(gamma) is computed (would give -inf)
- Other major statistical packages (R, MATLAB) typically don't produce exact zeros for gamma distributions
- The issue affects a significant portion of samples (55% zeros) making it a practical problem

**Arguments Against:**
- Wikipedia defines gamma support as [0, ∞), technically allowing zero
- NumPy documentation doesn't explicitly promise support will be (0, ∞)

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- This only occurs with extremely small shape parameters (< 0.001) which are rarely used in practice
- This is a fundamental floating-point precision limitation, not a coding error
- The values that aren't zero are on the order of 1e-13 to 1e-14, showing this is deep underflow territory
- Fixing this might require significant performance penalties for all gamma sampling

**Arguments Against:**
- 55% of values being zero is not an obscure edge case - it's a majority of the output
- Small shape parameters are valid mathematically and might be used in specialized applications

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- Wikipedia states the support is [0, ∞), so zeros are technically allowed
- NumPy documentation doesn't explicitly state the support excludes zero
- The documentation doesn't promise any specific behavior for extreme parameters

**Arguments Against:**
- Even if support includes zero, having 55% of samples be exactly zero is not the correct probability distribution
- The gamma distribution has zero probability mass at exactly zero for any positive shape parameter
- This is clearly unintended behavior from floating-point underflow

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The NumPy documentation should clarify what the support of the distribution is
- The documentation should warn about numerical limitations with extreme parameters
- This would help users understand the limitations without requiring code changes
- The behavior is somewhat reasonable (underflow to zero) but needs to be documented

**Arguments Against:**
- Simply documenting this doesn't fix the incorrect distribution being generated
- Users would still get mathematically incorrect results

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Handling extreme parameter values better could be seen as a new feature
- Adding warnings or parameter validation could be a feature addition

**Arguments Against:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already claims to implement gamma distribution

### Final Assessment
This is a case where the implementation produces mathematically incorrect results due to numerical underflow. While the support of the gamma distribution is debatable ([0, ∞) vs (0, ∞)), having 55% of samples be exactly zero is clearly not the correct gamma distribution for any positive shape parameter. The probability of getting exactly zero from a continuous distribution should be zero.

However, this occurs only with extreme parameter values that are at the edge of floating-point representation. The non-zero values produced (1e-13 to 1e-14) show we're in deep underflow territory where standard floating-point arithmetic breaks down.

The most appropriate categorization is **WONTFIX** because:
1. This only affects extremely small shape parameters (<0.001) rarely used in practice
2. It's a fundamental floating-point limitation, not a simple bug
3. Fixing it properly would likely require arbitrary precision arithmetic with significant performance costs
4. The mathematical ambiguity about whether support includes zero gives some cover

A close second choice would be DOCUMENTATION_FIX to at least warn users about these limitations.
