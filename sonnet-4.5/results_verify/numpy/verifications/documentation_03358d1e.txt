## Documentation Analysis for numpy.linalg.det

### Official NumPy Documentation
The official NumPy documentation for numpy.linalg.det states:
- Function computes the determinant of an array
- Uses LU factorization via LAPACK routines
- Suggests using slogdet() for large matrices to handle underflow/overflow
- No explicit mention of the property det(A) = det(A.T)
- No specific warnings about numerical precision issues with singular matrices
- No documented expectations for behavior with near-singular matrices

### Mathematical Literature
Mathematical references universally confirm that det(A) = det(A.T) is a fundamental property of determinants that holds for ALL square matrices in exact arithmetic. This is proven through:
- The Leibniz formula for determinants
- Properties of permutations and their inverses
- Elementary matrix operations

### Documentation Gaps
The NumPy documentation does not:
1. Explicitly state that det(A) should equal det(A.T)
2. Warn about potential numerical instability with singular/near-singular matrices
3. Document expected behavior when numerical errors occur
4. Specify tolerances or guarantees for floating-point computations

### Conclusion on Documentation
While the mathematical property det(A) = det(A.T) is universally accepted in linear algebra, NumPy's documentation does not explicitly guarantee this property will hold in floating-point arithmetic. However, the absence of a warning about this fundamental property potentially not holding could be considered a documentation issue itself, as users would reasonably expect this basic mathematical invariant to be preserved (at least in sign) even with floating-point approximations.
