## Documentation Analysis for numpy.strings.capitalize and numpy.strings.title

### NumPy Documentation Review

The NumPy documentation for both functions states:
1. **numpy.strings.capitalize**: "Return a copy of a with only the first character of each element capitalized" and explicitly states it "Calls str.capitalize() element-wise"
2. **numpy.strings.title**: "Return element-wise title cased version of string or unicode" and explicitly states it "Calls str.title() element-wise"

Both functions claim to call the corresponding Python string methods element-wise on array elements.

### Python Documentation Review

The Python documentation for the corresponding methods:
1. **str.capitalize()**: "Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased"
2. **str.title()**: "Return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase character and the remaining characters are lowercase"

Neither Python's nor NumPy's documentation specifically mentions behavior with null characters (\x00) or other special characters.

### Key Documentation Claims

The critical claim in NumPy's documentation is that these functions "call str.capitalize() element-wise" and "call str.title() element-wise". This creates an explicit contract that NumPy's behavior should match Python's behavior for each string element.

### Documentation Gaps

Neither documentation set explicitly addresses:
- Handling of null characters
- Whether string trimming or normalization occurs
- Whether all characters in the input are preserved in the output

However, the claim that NumPy calls Python's methods element-wise creates a reasonable expectation that the behavior should be identical for all inputs, including edge cases like null characters.
