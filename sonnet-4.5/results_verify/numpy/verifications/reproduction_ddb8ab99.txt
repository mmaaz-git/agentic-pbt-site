## Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported about pandas.io.json round-trip string index conversion.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test failed as expected, confirming the bug. The test generates DataFrames with string indices/columns and attempts to round-trip them through JSON. The test fails on the minimal case of a 1x1 DataFrame with orient='index', where the string index '0' is converted to integer 0.

Error from hypothesis test:
- Original index inferred type: string
- Roundtrip index inferred type: integer
- Falsifying example: orient='index', num_rows=1, num_cols=1

### Simple Reproduction Results

1. **String indices that look like numbers (orient='index')**:
   - Original: index=['0'], dtype=object (string)
   - After round-trip: index=[0], dtype=int64
   - Result: DataFrames are NOT equal

2. **String columns that look like numbers (orient='columns')**:
   - Original: columns=['0', '1', '2'], dtype=object (string)
   - After round-trip: columns=[0, 1, 2], dtype=int64
   - Result: DataFrames are NOT equal

3. **Mixed indices (numeric-looking and non-numeric strings)**:
   - Original: index=['0', 'a', '2'], dtype=object
   - After round-trip: index=['0', 'a', '2'], dtype=object
   - Result: DataFrames ARE equal (no conversion happens when mixed)

4. **Workaround with convert_axes=False**:
   - Original: index=['0'], dtype=object
   - After round-trip with convert_axes=False: index=['0'], dtype=object
   - Result: DataFrames ARE equal (workaround successful)

### Effect of the Bug
The bug causes silent type conversion of string indices/columns that happen to look like numbers during JSON round-tripping. This:
1. Breaks data integrity when string labels like '0', '1', '2' are intentionally strings
2. Occurs silently without warning (except for mixed indices which generate FutureWarnings)
3. Affects both row indices (orient='index') and column names (orient='columns')
4. Can be worked around by explicitly setting convert_axes=False in read_json()

The behavior is particularly problematic because it only occurs when ALL labels are numeric-looking strings - mixed labels preserve string type, creating inconsistent behavior.
