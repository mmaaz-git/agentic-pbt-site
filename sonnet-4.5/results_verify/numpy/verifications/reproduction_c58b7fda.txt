REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The key findings are:

1. Simple Test Case Reproduction:
   - Input: array([0.+0.j, 0.+1.j])
   - Applied: ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a)-2))
   - Expected (per docs): array([0.+0.j, 0.+1.j])
   - Actual result: array([0.-0.j, 0.-0.j])
   - The imaginary component is completely lost

2. Hypothesis Property-Based Test:
   - The property-based test fails immediately on the first example
   - Multiple random inputs fail the inverse property test
   - The test correctly identifies that ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a)-2)) != a

3. Extended Testing:
   I tested with various inputs including:
   - Non-Hermitian inputs (like the bug report example)
   - Properly Hermitian symmetric inputs
   - Real-valued inputs

   Results show that even with Hermitian symmetric inputs, the inverse property
   does NOT hold as documented. For example:
   - Hermitian input: [1+2j, 3+4j, 3-4j, 1-2j]
   - Recovered: [1-0j, 3+4j, 3-4j, 1-0j]
   - The imaginary parts are conjugated/lost

4. Core Issue Identified:
   The implementation appears to conjugate the result, so:
   ihfft(hfft(a, n)) returns conjugate(a) rather than a

   This violates the documented inverse property that states:
   "ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2)) == a, within roundoff error"

The bug report is accurately describing a real issue where the documented
mathematical property does not hold in the implementation.
