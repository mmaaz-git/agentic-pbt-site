REPRODUCTION RESULTS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The testing confirms the inconsistent behavior between 3D numpy array and 3D list inputs to the matrix constructor.

Test Results:
-------------

1. Direct Reproduction Test:
   - 3D numpy array input (shape (1,1,2)): SUCCEEDS, produces matrix of shape (1,2)
   - 3D list input [[0.0, 0.0]]: FAILS with ValueError "matrix must be 2-dimensional"
   - Both inputs represent exactly the same data structure

2. Property-Based Test with Hypothesis:
   - The test fails consistently across all tested dimensions (n=1-5, m=2-5)
   - Every 3D array of shape (1, n, m) succeeds when passed as numpy array
   - Every equivalent 3D list fails with ValueError
   - This confirms the issue is systemic, not limited to specific dimensions

3. Verified Data Equivalence:
   - Confirmed that np.array(list_3d) produces the exact same shape as arr_3d
   - np.array_equal confirms the data content is identical
   - The only difference is the input type (ndarray vs list)

Code Path Analysis:
-------------------

The source code inspection confirms two distinct code paths:

1. For ndarray inputs (lines 134-145):
   - Uses data.view(subtype) which triggers __array_finalize__
   - __array_finalize__ squeezes dimensions with size 1 (lines 182-186)
   - This allows 3D arrays like (1,1,2) to become 2D matrices (1,2)

2. For list inputs (lines 150-172):
   - Converts to array first with np.array()
   - Immediately checks if ndim > 2 and raises ValueError (line 156)
   - No opportunity for dimension squeezing before the check

The bug report accurately describes this inconsistency where logically equivalent inputs produce different results based solely on their type.
