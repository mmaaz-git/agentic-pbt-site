## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID:
- **Not applicable**: The bug violates explicitly documented constraints. The documentation clearly states matrices must be 2D, and the constructor enforces this. This is not a case of undefined behavior.

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
- **Possibly applicable due to deprecation**: The matrix class is deprecated with a PendingDeprecationWarning. One could argue that fixing bugs in deprecated code isn't worthwhile.
- **However**: The deprecation doesn't mean the code shouldn't work correctly while it exists. Users still rely on this behavior, and the inconsistency causes real failures (like the inverse operation breaking).

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- **Not applicable**: This isn't asking for new functionality. The 2D constraint already exists and is enforced elsewhere - this is about fixing an inconsistency in enforcement.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- **Not applicable**: The documentation correctly states that matrices must be 2D. The code's constructor and __array_finalize__ both enforce this. The bug is in __getitem__ not following the documented and enforced constraint.

### Consideration for BUG:
- **Strong evidence for BUG**:
  1. **Clear Contract Violation**: The documentation explicitly states "a matrix is a specialized 2-D array that retains its 2-D nature through operations"
  2. **Inconsistent Enforcement**: The constructor raises ValueError for ndim > 2, __array_finalize__ enforces 2D, but __getitem__ doesn't
  3. **Broken Invariant**: Matrix objects are allowed to exist in an invalid state (3D) which breaks matrix operations
  4. **Real Impact**: Operations like .I (inverse) fail with cryptic errors on 3D matrices
  5. **Simple Fix Available**: The bug report even provides a reasonable fix

### Conclusion:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The class has a fundamental invariant (2D only) that is:
- Explicitly documented
- Enforced in the constructor
- Enforced in __array_finalize__
- But NOT enforced in __getitem__

This inconsistency allows invalid matrix objects to exist, breaking the class contract and causing downstream failures. The fact that the class is deprecated doesn't negate the need to maintain consistency while it still exists.
