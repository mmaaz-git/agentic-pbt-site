## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Bug Confirmation
The bug is real and behaves exactly as described in the report:

1. **3D Matrix Creation**: When using `np.newaxis` with matrix indexing (`m[:, np.newaxis, :]`), a 3-dimensional matrix object is created with shape (2, 1, 3) from an original 2D matrix with shape (2, 3).

2. **Type Preservation**: The resulting object remains a `np.matrix` instance despite being 3-dimensional, which violates the fundamental constraint that matrices should be 2-dimensional.

3. **Broken Operations**: The 3D matrix object breaks expected matrix operations. Attempting to compute the inverse (`result.I`) fails with "too many values to unpack (expected 2)", demonstrating that matrix operations assume 2D structure.

4. **Hypothesis Test Failure**: The property-based test correctly identifies this violation across random inputs, failing with the assertion that expected a 2D matrix but got a 3D one.

### Impact
This is a genuine violation of the matrix class invariant. The numpy.matrix class is explicitly designed to maintain 2D structure through all operations, and the fact that __getitem__ can bypass this constraint creates:

- Inconsistency between constructor behavior (which enforces 2D) and indexing behavior
- Objects that claim to be matrices but violate matrix assumptions
- Runtime failures in matrix-specific operations that assume 2D structure

The bug report accurately describes both the problem and its consequences.
