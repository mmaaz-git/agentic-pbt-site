DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## numpy.ma.allclose Documentation Review

The official documentation for `numpy.ma.allclose` states:
- "Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance"
- "This function is equivalent to `allclose` except that masked values are treated as equal (default) or unequal"
- The function uses the formula: `absolute(a - b) <= (atol + rtol * absolute(b))`

## Key Findings

1. **No Explicit Symmetry Guarantee**: The documentation for `numpy.ma.allclose` does NOT explicitly state that the function should be symmetric (i.e., that `allclose(a, b)` should equal `allclose(b, a)`).

2. **Parent Function Asymmetry**: The documentation for the non-masked `numpy.allclose` function EXPLICITLY states: "The above equation is not symmetric in a and b, so that allclose(a, b) might be different from allclose(b, a) in some rare cases."

3. **Formula Inherently Asymmetric**: The tolerance formula `absolute(a - b) <= (atol + rtol * absolute(b))` is mathematically asymmetric because it uses `absolute(b)` in the relative tolerance calculation, not `absolute(a)`.

4. **Masked Values Behavior**: The documentation states that masked values are "treated as equal" when `masked_equal=True`, but doesn't specify how this interacts with infinity values.

## Critical Observation

While the documentation doesn't guarantee symmetry, there's an important distinction:
- The base `numpy.allclose` asymmetry is due to the tolerance formula using `absolute(b)`
- The bug in `numpy.ma.allclose` creates a DIFFERENT type of asymmetry specifically related to infinity handling with masked values

The documented asymmetry is about numerical tolerance calculations. The bug creates an additional asymmetry where masked positions are handled differently depending on argument order when infinities are involved. This appears to be unintentional behavior not covered by the documentation's asymmetry disclaimer.

## Documentation Gap

The documentation doesn't clearly specify how the function should behave when:
- One array contains infinity at an unmasked position
- The other array has that same position masked
- Whether this comparison should be symmetric

This is a gray area where the documentation is incomplete about the expected behavior.
