DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR numpy.strings.replace
=================================================

NUMPY DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:
-----------------------------
The official NumPy documentation for numpy.strings.replace states:
- Function signature: numpy.strings.replace(a, old, new, count=-1)
- Purpose: Performs element-wise string replacement on arrays
- The documentation indicates it operates similarly to Python's str.replace() method
- No specific mention of edge cases or special behavior for empty string patterns
- The documentation does not explicitly state that it should produce identical results to Python's str.replace()
- However, the documentation strongly implies it follows Python's semantics by showing examples that match Python behavior

PYTHON str.replace() BEHAVIOR:
-------------------------------
Python's str.replace() documentation states:
- Returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new
- When old is an empty string '', it matches at every position in the string
- This means for a string of length n, there are n+1 positions where '' matches:
  - Before the first character
  - Between each pair of adjacent characters
  - After the last character
- This is standard, well-established Python behavior since at least Python 2.x

IMPLICIT CONTRACT:
------------------
While the NumPy documentation doesn't explicitly state "produces identical results to Python's str.replace",
it does say the function performs replacement "element-wise" and shows examples that match Python behavior.
The reasonable expectation from users would be that numpy.strings.replace follows Python's string semantics
for all cases, including edge cases like empty string replacement.

KEY OBSERVATION:
----------------
The NumPy documentation does not specify any intentional deviation from Python's str.replace behavior.
The absence of any warning about different behavior for edge cases, combined with the implication that
it follows Python semantics, creates a reasonable expectation that the functions should behave identically.
