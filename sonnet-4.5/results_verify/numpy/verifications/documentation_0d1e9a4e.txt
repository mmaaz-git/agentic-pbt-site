Documentation Analysis for django.utils.lorem_ipsum.words()

I searched for official Django documentation for the lorem_ipsum.words() function but found no public documentation on Django's official documentation website. The django.utils.lorem_ipsum module appears to be an internal utility module that is not documented in Django's public API documentation.

The only documentation available is the function's docstring in the source code at /home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/utils/lorem_ipsum.py:

```python
def words(count, common=True):
    """
    Return a string of `count` lorem ipsum words separated by a single space.

    If `common` is True, then the first 19 words will be the standard
    'lorem ipsum' words. Otherwise, all words will be selected randomly.
    """
```

Key observations from the docstring:
1. The function states it will "Return a string of `count` lorem ipsum words"
2. The docstring describes what happens when `common` is True or False
3. There is NO specification about:
   - What valid values for `count` are
   - Whether negative counts are allowed or prohibited
   - What should happen if count is negative, zero, or otherwise invalid
   - Whether the function should raise exceptions for invalid input

The docstring only describes the positive case behavior - returning a string of `count` words. It does not explicitly state that `count` must be non-negative, nor does it specify the behavior for edge cases like negative numbers.

Since this is an internal Django utility (in django.utils, not in a public API module), and given that it lacks public documentation, the expectations for this function's behavior with invalid inputs are not clearly defined by Django's documentation.
