## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments For:**
- The functions claim to be equivalent to Python's str.partition/rpartition but behave differently
- Silent data corruption occurs - null bytes are stripped without warning
- The behavior is inconsistent even within NumPy (sometimes preserves, sometimes strips)
- Real-world impact on binary data, network protocols, file formats
- The documentation doesn't warn users about this limitation

**Arguments Against:**
- This is a known, fundamental limitation of NumPy's string representation
- GitHub Issue #20118 was closed as "not a bug" but a known limitation
- NumPy cannot distinguish between data null bytes and padding null bytes by design
- This affects all NumPy string operations, not just partition/rpartition

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments For:**
- NumPy team has already determined this is not a bug (Issue #20118)
- The limitation stems from NumPy's fundamental string storage design
- Fixing this would require redesigning NumPy's string representation

**Arguments Against:**
- The functions explicitly claim Python equivalence but don't deliver it
- Users have no way to know about this limitation from the partition/rpartition docs
- The bug report correctly identifies actual incorrect behavior

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments For:**
- The underlying issue is too fundamental to fix without breaking changes
- NumPy.char module is legacy and scheduled for deprecation
- Workarounds exist (use numpy.void for exact byte preservation)
- The issue only affects edge cases with null bytes

**Arguments Against:**
- This causes silent data corruption, which is serious
- The functions are still actively used and not yet deprecated
- No warning is given when data loss occurs

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments For:**
- The core issue is that the documentation doesn't mention the null byte limitation
- The functions work as designed given NumPy's string limitations
- Adding a warning to the docs would help users avoid this pitfall
- Other NumPy string functions have similar limitations that could be documented
- The behavior is consistent with NumPy's documented string handling limitations

**Arguments Against:**
- The functions claim to implement Python's behavior but don't
- Documentation alone won't fix the data corruption issue
- Users expect standard Python string behavior

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments For:**
- Could request new functions that handle null bytes correctly
- Could request optional parameters to preserve null bytes
- The current behavior is "working as designed" given NumPy's architecture

**Arguments Against:**
- This isn't requesting new functionality, but fixing broken existing functionality
- The functions already exist and claim to do something they don't do correctly
- Data corruption is a bug, not a missing feature

### Final Assessment

This is most appropriately categorized as **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** because:

1. The NumPy team has already established this is a known limitation, not a bug (Issue #20118)
2. The root cause is NumPy's fundamental string representation design
3. The real problem is that numpy.char.partition/rpartition documentation doesn't warn about this limitation
4. The documentation incorrectly implies full equivalence with Python's methods
5. Fixing the documentation would at least warn users about potential data loss
6. The numpy.char module is legacy and scheduled for deprecation, making major fixes unlikely

While the behavior causes real problems, the NumPy project has consistently treated null byte issues as design limitations rather than bugs. The most actionable fix is updating the documentation to warn users about this limitation.
