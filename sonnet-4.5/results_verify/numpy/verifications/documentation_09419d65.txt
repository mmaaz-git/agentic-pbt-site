## Documentation Analysis for numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes

### Official Documentation

From the official NumPy documentation and docstrings:

1. **as_ctypes function**:
   - Purpose: "Create and return a ctypes object from a numpy array. Actually anything that exposes the __array_interface__ is accepted."
   - No specific limitations mentioned for structured arrays
   - Examples only show simple dtype arrays (integers)
   - No mention that structured arrays are unsupported

2. **as_ctypes_type function**:
   - Purpose: "Convert a dtype into a ctypes type"
   - Explicitly includes example for structured arrays: "Converting a structured dtype"
   - Shows it successfully converts structured dtypes to ctypes Structure classes
   - Raises NotImplementedError "If the conversion is not possible"

### Key Observations:

1. **Documentation gap**: The as_ctypes documentation does not mention any limitation regarding structured arrays. The docstring says it accepts "anything that exposes the __array_interface__", which structured arrays do.

2. **Inconsistent behavior**: The documentation shows as_ctypes_type() explicitly supporting structured arrays with examples, while as_ctypes() fails on the same arrays despite no documented limitation.

3. **Implementation detail**: Looking at the source code (line 599), as_ctypes uses `ai["typestr"]` from __array_interface__, which for structured arrays returns a void type like "|V12". This implementation detail contradicts the expectation set by the documentation.

4. **User expectation**: Given that:
   - as_ctypes_type() supports structured dtypes (documented with examples)
   - as_ctypes() claims to support anything with __array_interface__
   - No documented limitation exists for structured arrays
   Users would reasonably expect as_ctypes() to work with structured arrays.

### Conclusion:

The documentation does not indicate that structured arrays are unsupported by as_ctypes(). The failure appears to be an implementation bug rather than intended behavior, as there's no documentation warning users about this limitation.
