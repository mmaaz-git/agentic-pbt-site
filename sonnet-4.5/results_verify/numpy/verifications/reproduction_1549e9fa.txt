REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

Test Results:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION - CONFIRMED
   - Input: cat_core([['hello'], ['world']], '\x00')
   - Expected: 'hello\x00world'
   - Actual: 'helloworld'
   - The null byte is completely dropped from the output

2. COMPARATIVE TESTING - BUG ISOLATED TO NULL BYTES
   - All other separators work correctly (pipe, tab, newline, space, SOH)
   - Only null byte (\x00) fails
   - Empty string separator works as expected
   - Even \x01 (SOH) works fine, showing this is specific to \x00

3. PROPERTY-BASED TEST - FAILS AS REPORTED
   - The Hypothesis test fails on the minimal case (array_length=1, num_arrays=2)
   - Confirms the bug exists across various input configurations

4. ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION - NUMPY INTERACTION
   - The bug occurs when numpy.sum is called on a mixed object array containing:
     * numpy arrays (the column data)
     * scalar string containing null byte (the separator)
   - numpy.sum correctly handles null bytes when:
     * All elements are plain strings
     * The separator is also a numpy array
   - The issue is specifically the mixed types scenario

5. EDGE CASES TESTED:
   - Double null bytes (\x00\x00): Also fails, both bytes dropped
   - Null byte within separator ('X\x00Y'): Works correctly! The null is preserved
   - Empty strings with null separator: Null byte is dropped

Technical Details:
- The bug is reproducible and consistent
- It's a silent data corruption issue - no error is raised
- The proposed fix in the bug report (converting separator to array) would work but has the wrong implementation
- The actual fix would be simpler: np.array([sep], dtype=object) instead of np.full(array_length, sep, dtype=object)

Conclusion:
The bug is REAL and REPRODUCIBLE. Null bytes are silently dropped when used as separators in cat_core due to a numpy.sum quirk with mixed object arrays.
