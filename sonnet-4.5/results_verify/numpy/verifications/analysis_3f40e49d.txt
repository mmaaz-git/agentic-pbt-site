TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID (Not the case)
   - Why it might be INVALID:
     * Could argue that the user should provide both dictionaries
     * Could claim undefined behavior for partial dictionary provision
   - Why it's NOT INVALID:
     * Both parameters are clearly documented as optional
     * No documentation states they are interdependent
     * The API signature shows default values of None for both
     * The crash is not an intentional error but an implementation oversight
     * Other optional parameter combinations work correctly

2. WONTFIX (Not the case)
   - Why it might be WONTFIX:
     * Could argue this is an obscure edge case
     * Matrix module is deprecated in favor of regular arrays
   - Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
     * This is a clear API contract violation
     * The fix is trivial (one line change)
     * The crash prevents legitimate use cases
     * Not an obscure mathematical edge case but basic parameter handling

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not the case)
   - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
     * Could claim supporting gdict-only is a new feature
   - Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
     * The documentation already states both are optional
     * This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new
     * The API already promises this should work

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Not the case)
   - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
     * Could update docs to say ldict is required when gdict is provided
   - Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
     * The current documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
     * Changing the docs would be making the API worse/more restrictive
     * The code is wrong, not the documentation
     * The fix is simpler in code than changing the documented API

5. BUG (This is the correct category)
   - Why it IS a BUG:
     * Clear violation of documented API contract
     * Function crashes instead of working as documented
     * Both parameters are marked optional but cannot be used independently
     * The error is unintentional (NoneType subscript error, not ValueError)
     * Other similar parameter combinations work correctly
     * The fix is straightforward and matches user expectations
     * This breaks legitimate use cases where users want to provide global
       context without local context

Additional Considerations:
- The _from_string function's logic shows it tries local dict first, then global
- An empty local dict would correctly fall through to global dict lookup
- The suggested fix (ldict if ldict is not None else {}) is minimal and correct
- This maintains backward compatibility while fixing the crash

Conclusion: This is a valid BUG that should be fixed in the codebase.
