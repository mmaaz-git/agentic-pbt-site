BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed and behaves exactly as described.

## Hypothesis Test Reproduction

The provided Hypothesis test fails when given data=[0.0]:
- A Series with float64 dtype containing [0.0] is created
- After JSON round-trip, the dtype changes to int64
- The assertion pd.testing.assert_series_equal(s, result) fails due to dtype mismatch

## Simple Example Reproduction

The simple reproduction case also confirms the bug:
- Original Series: [0.0] with dtype float64
- JSON representation: {"0":0.0}
- After round-trip: [0] with dtype int64
- Bug confirmed: dtypes don't match

## Pattern Analysis

Testing with various float values revealed a clear pattern:
- [0.0] → dtype changes from float64 to int64
- [1.0] → dtype changes from float64 to int64
- [1.5] → dtype remains float64
- [0.0, 1.0] → dtype changes from float64 to int64
- [0.5, 1.5] → dtype remains float64
- [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] → dtype changes from float64 to int64

The pattern is consistent: when ALL float values are integer-valued (e.g., 0.0, 1.0, 2.0),
pandas infers them as int64 during deserialization. When at least one value has a fractional
part, the float64 dtype is preserved.

## Workaround Verification

The suggested workaround using dtype=False was tested and confirmed:
- With default dtype parameter (dtype=True): float64 → int64 (bug occurs)
- With dtype=False: float64 → float64 (dtype preserved)
- With dtype=True explicitly: float64 → int64 (bug occurs)

This confirms that the issue is caused by pandas' automatic dtype inference when dtype=True
(the default behavior), and can be avoided by setting dtype=False.

## Impact

This bug affects any code that:
1. Serializes pandas Series with float64 dtype containing integer-valued floats
2. Expects the dtype to be preserved during round-trip operations
3. Relies on dtype consistency for downstream operations (e.g., numerical computations, C library interfaces)
