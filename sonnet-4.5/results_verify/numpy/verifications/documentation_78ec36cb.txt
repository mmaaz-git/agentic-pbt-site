## numpy.linalg.eig Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation
The official numpy.linalg.eig documentation states:

1. **Purpose**: Computes eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square matrix

2. **Mathematical Definition**: The documentation explicitly states that the function returns eigenvalues and eigenvectors that satisfy: `a @ eigenvectors[:,i] = eigenvalues[i] * eigenvectors[:,i]`

3. **Eigenvector Normalization**: The eigenvectors are normalized to unit length

4. **Implementation**: Uses LAPACK's _geev routines

5. **Numerical Notes**:
   - The documentation acknowledges potential round-off error in computations
   - States that eigenvector columns might not be maximally independent
   - Does not specify tolerance levels for the eigenvalue equation

### Key Observations

1. **No Explicit Tolerance Specification**: The documentation does not specify what tolerance level should be expected for the eigenvalue equation `A @ v = λ * v`. It simply states this equation should be satisfied, without quantifying "how closely" it should be satisfied.

2. **Round-off Error Acknowledgement**: The documentation does acknowledge that round-off errors can occur but doesn't specify:
   - What magnitude of error is acceptable
   - Under what conditions the errors might be larger
   - Any specific limitations with extremely small values

3. **No Special Warnings About Small Values**: The documentation does not warn users about potential issues with matrices containing very small (but non-zero) values like 1e-300.

4. **LAPACK Implementation**: The function uses LAPACK's _geev routine, which is a standard implementation for general eigenvalue problems. Any numerical issues would be inherent to this LAPACK routine.

### Related Documentation and Known Issues

From additional research:

1. **Known Numerical Stability Issues**: There are documented cases of numerical precision issues with numpy.linalg.eig, especially with ill-conditioned matrices or those with values spanning many orders of magnitude.

2. **Alternative Functions**: The documentation suggests using eigh() for symmetric/Hermitian matrices for better accuracy, and scipy.linalg.schur for non-Hermitian normal matrices.

3. **No Explicit Small Value Handling**: Neither the official documentation nor supplementary sources indicate special handling for denormalized numbers or values approaching machine epsilon.

### Conclusion from Documentation

The documentation states that the eigenvalue equation `A @ v = λ * v` should be satisfied but does not specify:
- Acceptable tolerance levels for this equation
- Behavior with extremely small values (1e-300)
- Whether an error magnitude of 1.0 (as reported in the bug) would be considered acceptable

The documentation acknowledges round-off errors but doesn't quantify acceptable error bounds. This creates ambiguity about whether the reported behavior (error of 1.0 in the eigenvalue equation) constitutes a bug or falls within expected numerical limitations.
