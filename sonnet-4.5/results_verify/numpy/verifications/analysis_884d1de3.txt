## Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report):
**Strong Evidence For:**
- The documentation explicitly guarantees the round-trip property: "irfft(rfft(a), len(a)) == a"
- Size-1 arrays are mathematically valid FFT inputs (representing DC-only signals)
- The forward transform (rfft/rfftn) successfully handles size-1 arrays
- The inverse transform works when n is explicitly specified as 1
- The bug is in the default parameter calculation, not the FFT implementation itself
- This breaks a fundamental property that users rely on for signal processing

**Evidence Against:**
- None. The documentation clearly states the round-trip should work.

### Considering INVALID (Incorrect Report):
**Evidence For:**
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

**Evidence Against:**
- The bug report is accurate in all details
- The error occurs exactly as described
- The proposed fix correctly identifies the issue

### Considering WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant):
**Evidence For:**
- Size-1 arrays might be considered an edge case
- Users can work around by explicitly specifying n=1

**Evidence Against:**
- Violates a fundamental documented guarantee
- Breaks generic array processing code that might encounter size-1 arrays
- The forward transform works, making the asymmetry surprising
- Size-1 arrays occur naturally in many contexts (e.g., single-channel signals, 1x1 images)
- The fix is simple and doesn't affect other cases

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported):
**Evidence For:**
- Could argue that automatic handling of size-1 is a new feature

**Evidence Against:**
- The documentation already promises this will work via the round-trip guarantee
- The forward transform already supports size-1 arrays
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue):
**Evidence For:**
- Could update docs to warn about size-1 arrays
- Could document that n must be explicitly specified for size-1 inputs

**Evidence Against:**
- The documentation correctly states the round-trip property should work
- Changing the docs would be admitting defeat on a fundamental property
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- The fix to the code is simpler than documenting workarounds

### Final Assessment:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The code violates an explicitly documented guarantee (the round-trip property) for valid inputs (size-1 arrays). The forward transform handles these arrays correctly, but the inverse transform fails due to an incorrect default parameter calculation. The bug has a clear fix that doesn't impact other functionality.
