## Documentation Analysis for numpy.ma.flatnotmasked_edges

### Official Documentation Review

The function docstring states:
- "Find the indices of the first and last unmasked values."
- "Expects a 1-D MaskedArray, returns None if all values are masked."
- Returns: "The indices of first and last non-masked value in the array. Returns None if all values are masked."

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Explicit behavior for all-masked arrays**: The documentation clearly states that the function returns `None` when all values are masked. This is demonstrated in the example:
   ```python
   >>> a[:] = np.ma.masked
   >>> print(np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a))
   None
   ```

2. **No explicit mention of empty arrays**: The documentation does not specifically address the behavior for empty arrays. It only mentions:
   - "Expects a 1-D MaskedArray"
   - "Returns None if all values are masked"

3. **Semantic interpretation**: An empty array conceptually has no unmasked values (there are no values at all). The documentation's statement "returns None if all values are masked" could reasonably be interpreted to include the case where there are no values at all.

4. **Expected return format**: When the function does return indices, the documentation states it returns "The indices of first and last non-masked value in the array." This implies valid, usable indices into the array.

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not explicitly specify:
- What happens with empty arrays (arrays with size 0)
- Whether returned indices should always be valid array indices
- The relationship between "no unmasked values" and "no values at all"

### Reasonable User Expectations

Based on the documentation:
1. A user would expect valid indices when indices are returned
2. The indices should satisfy basic properties: first_index <= last_index and both should be valid array indices
3. An empty array, having no unmasked values, might reasonably be expected to return `None` (similar to all-masked arrays)
4. Returning `[0, -1]` for an empty array is not documented behavior and produces invalid indices that cannot be used
