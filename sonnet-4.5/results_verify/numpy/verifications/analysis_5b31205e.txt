## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug):
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function returns negative values (-9223372036854775808) when it should only return positive integers >= 1
- The documentation explicitly states the distribution is "supported on the positive integers, k = 1, 2, ..."
- The input p=1e-100 is mathematically valid (0 < p < 1) according to both documentation and mathematical definition
- This is silent data corruption - no error is raised, just incorrect values returned
- The behavior violates fundamental mathematical properties of the geometric distribution
- The issue occurs consistently and reproducibly with small p values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None - this clearly violates documented behavior

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that p=1e-100 is unreasonably small for practical use

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation does not specify a minimum value for p beyond "between 0 and 1"
- 1e-100 is mathematically valid (0 < 1e-100 < 1)
- Even if the input is extreme, returning INT64_MIN is incorrect - it should either work or raise an error
- The function accepts the value without raising an error, implying it's considered valid input

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- p=1e-100 is an extremely small probability that would rarely occur in practice
- With such small probabilities, the expected number of trials would be astronomical (1e100)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not just a minor edge case - it returns completely invalid data (negative numbers)
- Silent data corruption is a serious issue regardless of how rare the input might be
- The function could easily validate input and raise an error if it can't handle small p values
- Other users might encounter this with p values as "large" as 1e-20, which is not that extreme

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could reframe as requesting support for extremely small probability values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function already claims to support all p values between 0 and 1
- This is not adding new functionality but fixing existing broken functionality
- The mathematical definition of geometric distribution includes all p in (0, 1]

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could update documentation to specify minimum supported p values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- The documentation correctly describes what the function SHOULD do
- Changing documentation to say "doesn't work for small p" would be admitting a limitation that shouldn't exist

### Final Analysis:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function violates its documented behavior by returning negative values when it should only return positive integers. The severity is high because:

1. It silently corrupts data without raising an error
2. It violates fundamental mathematical properties
3. The input values are within the documented valid range
4. The issue affects a range of small p values (< ~1e-20), not just one extreme edge case

The correct fix would be either:
- Fix the algorithm to handle small p values correctly
- Raise a clear error when p is too small to compute accurately
- Document the limitation IF fixing is technically infeasible (but this would still be acknowledging a bug)
