## Documentation Analysis for eliminate_quotes and insert_quotes

### Available Documentation

1. **Function Docstrings**:
   - `eliminate_quotes(s)`: "Replace quoted substrings of input string. Return a new string and a mapping of replacements."
   - `insert_quotes(s, d)`: "Inverse of eliminate_quotes."

2. **Module Context**:
   - Part of numpy.f2py.symbolic module for handling "Fortran/C symbolic expressions"
   - Module references J3/21-007: Draft Fortran 202x specification

### Key Findings

1. **No Explicit Constraints Documented**:
   - The documentation does not specify what happens with unmatched quotes
   - No mention of required input format or constraints
   - No documentation states that input must have properly matched quotes

2. **Documented Inverse Relationship**:
   - `insert_quotes` is explicitly documented as "Inverse of eliminate_quotes"
   - This implies a round-trip property: `insert_quotes(eliminate_quotes(s)) == s`
   - The existing tests (test_symbolic.py) verify this round-trip property

3. **Usage Context**:
   - Used by FortranExpressionParser.parse() to preprocess Fortran expressions
   - All test cases in test_symbolic.py use properly quoted strings
   - Tests verify round-trip with strings like: '"1234" // "ABCD"', '"1\\"2\'AB\'34"'

4. **Implementation Details (from code)**:
   - Uses regex to match complete quoted strings
   - Has assertions that no quotes remain after processing
   - These assertions are not documented as part of the API contract

### Critical Observation

The documentation states `insert_quotes` is the "inverse" of `eliminate_quotes` but does not specify:
- Whether this inverse relationship should hold for ALL inputs
- Whether there are preconditions on the input (e.g., properly matched quotes)
- What the expected behavior is for malformed input

The assertion failures are internal implementation details not exposed in the public API documentation. The user-facing documentation suggests these functions should work as inverses without stating exceptions.
