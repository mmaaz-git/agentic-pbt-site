## Reproduction of the Bug

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Property-Based Test Reproduction
- The Hypothesis test fails as described, finding counterexamples where det(A) != det(A.T)
- Example failure found: A matrix with pattern [[0, 0, x], [x, x, x], [x, x, x]] where x is a non-zero value
- This pattern consistently produces opposite signs for det(A) vs det(A.T)

### Specific Example Reproduction
Testing the provided example matrix:
```
A = [[     0. ,      0. , 416614.5],
     [416614.5, 416614.5, 416614.5],
     [416614.5, 416614.5, 416614.5]]
```

Results:
- det(A) = 10.102966428399663
- det(A.T) = -10.102966428399663
- Magnitudes are identical: |det(A)| = |det(A.T)| = 10.102966428399663
- Signs are opposite, confirming the bug

### Mathematical Analysis
The matrix is singular (rank 2, not 3) because rows 2 and 3 are identical. Mathematically, the determinant should be exactly 0. The condition number is extremely high (~1.64e17), indicating severe numerical instability.

### Effect
The bug causes a violation of the fundamental mathematical property det(A) = det(A.T). While the computed values are small (near-zero as expected for singular matrices), the sign inconsistency is problematic because:
1. It violates a basic linear algebra invariant
2. It produces different results for mathematically equivalent operations
3. It could lead to incorrect conclusions in algorithms that depend on determinant signs
