## Documentation Analysis for numpy.linalg.pinv

### Official Documentation Review

I examined the official numpy documentation for `numpy.linalg.pinv` and found the following:

#### Function Purpose
The function computes the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a matrix using singular-value decomposition (SVD).

#### Documented Mathematical Properties
The documentation explicitly states in the **Examples** section (lines 2247-2257 in source):
- "The following example checks that `a * a+ * a == a` and `a+ * a * a+ == a+`"
- Example code demonstrates: `np.allclose(a, np.dot(a, np.dot(B, a)))` returns True
- This establishes that the reconstruction property `a @ pinv(a) @ a == a` is a documented guarantee

#### Mathematical Definition
The documentation explains that the pseudo-inverse is computed as:
- Q2 * Σ+ * Q1^T where Σ+ consists of "reciprocals of A's singular values"
- This reciprocal operation is where the overflow occurs with subnormal values

#### Edge Case Documentation
**CRITICAL FINDING**: The documentation does NOT mention:
- How the function handles subnormal/denormalized floating-point values
- Any limitations regarding extremely small singular values that could cause overflow
- Expected behavior when computing reciprocals leads to infinity
- Any warnings about NaN or inf in results

#### Error Handling
The documentation only mentions:
- Raises `LinAlgError` if SVD computation does not converge
- No mention of overflow errors or NaN/inf handling

### Implementation Analysis
From the source code (line 2285):
```python
s = divide(1, s, where=large, out=s)
```
This line performs the reciprocal operation without checking for overflow, which causes the bug.

### Conclusion
The documentation establishes that `a @ pinv(a) @ a == a` is a fundamental property that should hold. The function fails to satisfy this documented property when given valid (though extreme) floating-point inputs. The documentation does not warn about or exclude subnormal values from the expected domain of the function.
