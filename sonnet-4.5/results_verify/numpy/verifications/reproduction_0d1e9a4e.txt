Bug Reproduction Analysis for django.utils.lorem_ipsum.words()

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. Here are the findings:

1. CONFIRMED: words(-1, common=True) returns 18 words instead of 0 words or raising an error
   - Actual output: 'lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna'
   - This is 18 out of the 19 COMMON_WORDS

2. The bug is caused by Python's list slicing behavior on line 285 of the source code:
   ```python
   else:
       word_list = word_list[:count]  # Line 285
   ```

   When count is -1 and word_list has 19 elements:
   - word_list[:-1] returns all elements except the last one (18 words)
   - This is standard Python slicing behavior, not a Python bug

3. Interestingly, the behavior differs between common=True and common=False:
   - words(-1, common=True) returns 18 words
   - words(-1, common=False) returns 0 words (empty string)

   This inconsistency occurs because:
   - With common=True, word_list starts with 19 COMMON_WORDS
   - With common=False, word_list starts empty []
   - The slicing [:âˆ’1] on an empty list returns an empty list

4. Testing various negative values with common=True:
   - words(-1, common=True): 18 words (all but last 1)
   - words(-5, common=True): 14 words (all but last 5)
   - words(-10, common=True): 9 words (all but last 10)
   - words(-19, common=True): 0 words (all but all 19)
   - words(-20, common=True): 0 words (beyond list bounds)

5. The Hypothesis test correctly identifies this as unexpected behavior, as it asserts that negative counts should return 0 words or raise an error.

The technical details in the bug report are accurate. The function does indeed return unexpected results for negative count values due to Python's negative list slicing semantics.
