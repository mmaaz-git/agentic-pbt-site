## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that providing gdict alone without ldict should work. One could argue that when using custom dictionaries, both should be provided together as a pair. The documentation states ldict is "ignored if gdict is None" which might imply they work as a unit.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
Both parameters are marked as optional with default values of None, which strongly suggests they should be independently optional. The function crashes with a basic TypeError rather than providing a meaningful error message. When providing an empty dict for ldict works perfectly, it shows the intended behavior is clear - the function should handle None the same as an empty dict.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue this is an edge case since most users either use the implicit scope lookup (no parameters) or provide both dictionaries explicitly. The workaround is trivial - just pass an empty dict for ldict. The matrix module is considered legacy in numpy (users are encouraged to use regular arrays instead).

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not an obscure edge case - it's a natural use case to want to provide a global namespace without a local one. The crash is ungraceful and confusing. The fix is trivial (one line change) and makes the API more consistent. Even legacy code should not crash on reasonable inputs.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be clearer about the relationship between ldict and gdict parameters. It could explicitly state that when providing gdict, ldict must also be provided (at least as an empty dict). This would set proper expectations for users.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior is clearly a bug, not a documentation issue. Optional parameters should be independently optional unless explicitly documented otherwise. Changing documentation to match buggy behavior is backwards - the code should be fixed to match the reasonable interpretation of "optional" parameters.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting gdict without ldict could be seen as a new feature - extending the function to handle a case it wasn't originally designed for. The current design might have assumed both would always be provided together when overriding scope lookup.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality - it's asking for optional parameters to actually be optional. The function already has all the logic needed (it works with an empty ldict). This is fixing broken behavior, not adding features.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with an unhelpful TypeError when called with reasonable, documented parameters. Both ldict and gdict are marked as optional, suggesting they should be independently usable. The fix is trivial and obvious - treating None the same as {} for ldict. The code already has proper fallback logic from ldict to gdict; it just needs to handle the None case.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise this should work. Some might argue the parameters, while optional, were meant to be used together when overriding default scope behavior.

## Overall consideration
This appears to be a legitimate bug. The function has two optional parameters that should be independently optional based on standard Python conventions and the documentation. When a user provides gdict without ldict, they're making a reasonable request: "use this global namespace for variable lookup." The function crashes ungracefully rather than handling this sensible use case.

The implementation already has the correct logic to search ldict first and fall back to gdict - it just fails to handle the case where ldict is None. The proposed fix is minimal, correct, and makes the API behave as users would reasonably expect. The fact that passing an empty dict for ldict works perfectly demonstrates what the intended behavior should be.

While the numpy.matrix module is considered legacy, it's still part of the public API and should not crash on reasonable inputs. This is a clear case where the implementation doesn't match reasonable expectations set by marking parameters as optional.
