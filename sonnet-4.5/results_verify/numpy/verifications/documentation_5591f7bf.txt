DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION SAYS:
----------------------------

1. Polynomial Class Support for Operators:
   - The documentation confirms that the Polynomial class provides standard Python numerical
     methods including '*' and '**'
   - These are listed as supported operators without qualification

2. Trim Method:
   - A trim() method exists and is documented
   - Purpose: "Remove trailing coefficients until a coefficient is reached whose absolute
     value greater than tol or the beginning of the series is reached"
   - If all coefficients would be removed, the series is set to [0]
   - Returns a NEW instance with trimmed coefficients

3. Mathematical Properties:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly state that p**n should equal p*p*...*p
     in terms of coefficient representation
   - No mention of consistency requirements between ** and * operators regarding
     coefficient arrays
   - No documentation about how underflow situations should be handled

4. Coefficient Representation:
   - Coefficients are specified "in order of increasing degree"
   - No explicit statement about normalization or canonical forms for coefficient arrays

WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT SAY:
------------------------------------

1. The documentation does NOT specify:
   - That p**n must produce identical coefficient arrays to p*p*...*p
   - How trailing zeros should be handled consistently across operations
   - Whether coefficient arrays should be automatically trimmed after operations
   - That different operators should produce normalized/canonical representations

2. Implementation details are not documented:
   - When trimming occurs automatically
   - Whether different operators use different code paths
   - How numerical underflow affects coefficient representation

MATHEMATICAL ALGEBRA CONSIDERATIONS:
------------------------------------

From a mathematical standpoint:
- The fundamental property p^n = p × p × ... × p (n times) is a basic algebraic identity
- This is universally expected in polynomial algebra
- While not explicitly documented, this is an implicit mathematical requirement

IMPLICATIONS:
-------------

The documentation is INCOMPLETE regarding:
1. Consistency expectations between operators
2. Coefficient array normalization behavior
3. The relationship between mathematical equivalence and representation equivalence

The lack of explicit documentation about coefficient array consistency means this could be
viewed as either:
- An undocumented implementation detail (user should not rely on specific array shapes)
- A violation of implicit mathematical expectations (operators should behave consistently)
