## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test
The property-based test fails as reported with the input `coefs=[0.0], size=2`:
- Expected behavior: `truncate(2)` should return a polynomial with 2 coefficients
- Actual behavior: Returns a polynomial with 1 coefficient (the original unchanged)

### Manual Reproduction
I ran the provided reproduction code and confirmed the exact outputs:

Test 1: `Polynomial([1]).truncate(3)`
- Expected length: 3
- Actual length: 1
- Result: The polynomial remains unchanged when size > len(coef)

Test 2: `Polynomial([0.0]).truncate(2)`
- Expected length: 2
- Actual length: 1
- Result: Same behavior, polynomial unchanged

Test 3: `Polynomial([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).truncate(3)`
- Expected length: 3
- Actual length: 3
- Result: Works correctly when size <= len(coef), truncating to exactly 3 coefficients

### Source Code Analysis
Examining the implementation in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/polynomial/_polybase.py` at lines 773-776:

```python
if isize >= len(self.coef):
    coef = self.coef
else:
    coef = self.coef[:isize]
```

This confirms the behavior: when `size >= len(self.coef)`, the method returns the original coefficients unchanged rather than extending to the requested size.

### Effect
The method's behavior directly contradicts its documentation which states "Truncate series to length `size`" and "The series is reduced to length `size`". When size is larger than the current length, users expect the result to have exactly `size` coefficients (possibly padded with zeros), but instead get a polynomial with fewer coefficients than requested.
