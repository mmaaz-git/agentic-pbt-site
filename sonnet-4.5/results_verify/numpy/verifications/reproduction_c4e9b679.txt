I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report:

1. **Bug Reproduction**:
   - Created a structured array with dtype `[('x', np.int32), ('y', np.float64)]`
   - Attempted to call `np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes(arr)`
   - Result: `NotImplementedError: Converting dtype('V12') to a ctypes type`
   - This matches the exact error reported

2. **Root Cause Verified**:
   - The issue is on line 599 of `_ctypeslib.py`: `ctype_scalar = as_ctypes_type(ai["typestr"])`
   - For structured arrays, `ai["typestr"]` returns `'|V12'` (void type with size)
   - This void typestr loses all field information from the structured dtype
   - When `as_ctypes_type` receives `'|V12'`, it cannot reconstruct the struct

3. **Inconsistency Confirmed**:
   - `np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes_type(arr.dtype)` works perfectly and returns `<class 'struct'>`
   - `np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes_type(ai["typestr"])` fails with NotImplementedError
   - This proves the bug is specifically in passing typestr instead of dtype

4. **Fix Validation**:
   - Implemented the proposed fix: changing line 599 to use `obj.dtype` instead of `ai["typestr"]`
   - The fixed version successfully converts structured arrays to ctypes
   - Round-trip conversion (to ctypes and back to numpy) preserves data correctly
   - Regular arrays still work correctly with the fix

5. **Property-Based Test**:
   - The hypothesis test fails with the current implementation for ANY structured dtype
   - This confirms it's a systematic issue, not an edge case

The technical details in the bug report are accurate. The bug is real, reproducible, and the proposed fix works correctly.
