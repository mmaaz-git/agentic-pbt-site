## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Verification
The bug report's technical details are CORRECT:

1. **Hypothesis test fails**: The provided hypothesis test correctly fails with input `text='\n'`, showing that removespaces does indeed remove newline characters.

2. **Specific examples confirmed**:
   - `removespaces('\n')` returns `''` (not `'\n'`)
   - `removespaces('\ra\r')` returns `'a'` (not `'\ra\r'`)
   - `removespaces('\t')` returns `''` (not `'\t'`)

3. **Root cause confirmed**: The function uses `expr.strip()` which removes ALL whitespace characters from both ends of the string, not just spaces.

### Function Behavior Analysis
The function's actual behavior:
1. Removes ALL leading and trailing whitespace (via `strip()`)
2. Then selectively removes internal spaces that are adjacent to operators/delimiters
3. Keeps spaces that are not adjacent to special characters

Examples:
- `removespaces('a b c')` → `'a b c'` (internal spaces preserved)
- `removespaces('a + b')` → `'a+b'` (spaces near operators removed)
- `removespaces('(a b)')` → `'(a b)'` (space after '(' removed, middle space kept)

### Context of Usage
The function is used in processing Fortran entity declarations where:
- It's paired with `markinnerspaces()` which protects quoted spaces
- It normalizes spacing in Fortran expressions
- It's an internal utility, not a public API

### Key Finding
The bug report is technically accurate: the function DOES remove non-space whitespace characters (tabs, newlines, carriage returns) despite its name suggesting it only removes spaces. The implementation uses `strip()` which removes all whitespace, not `strip(' ')` which would only remove spaces.
