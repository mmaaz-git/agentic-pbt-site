DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing the NumPy documentation for the affected functions (str_len, capitalize, find, slice), I found:

1. NumPy String Function Documentation:
   - The documentation for numpy.strings.str_len states it returns "the length of each string element"
   - For Unicode strings, it counts "Unicode code points"
   - For byte strings, it counts "bytes"
   - NO explicit mention of null character handling
   - NO statement that null characters terminate strings

2. numpy.strings.capitalize Documentation:
   - States it calls "str.capitalize() element-wise"
   - Should return "a copy with only the first character of each element capitalized"
   - NO mention of null character handling
   - Implies it should follow Python's str.capitalize() behavior

3. numpy.strings.find Documentation:
   - Returns "the lowest index where substring is found"
   - NO mention of special null character handling
   - NO statement about C-style string termination

4. Python String Documentation:
   - Python documentation confirms: "Since Python strings have an explicit length, %s conversions do not assume that '\0' is the end of the string"
   - This indicates Python strings are length-prefixed and null bytes are valid characters
   - Python's standard string methods correctly handle null bytes as regular characters

5. NumPy String Module Notes:
   - Documentation states string operations are "based on the methods in the Python string module"
   - This strongly implies NumPy should follow Python's string behavior
   - The numpy.char module (legacy) is being replaced by numpy.strings for better consistency

KEY FINDING:
The documentation does NOT specify that null characters should terminate strings. Since NumPy string functions claim to be "based on Python string methods" and call methods "element-wise", they should handle null characters the same way Python does - as valid characters that don't terminate the string.

The current behavior (treating \x00 as a string terminator) contradicts:
1. The implicit promise of Python-compatible string handling
2. The stated behavior of counting "Unicode code points" (null is a valid code point)
3. The claim of calling Python's str methods "element-wise"
