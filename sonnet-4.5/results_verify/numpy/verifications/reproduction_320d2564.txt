REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the reported behavior with numpy.char.array() and numpy.char.asarray().

TEST RESULTS:

1. Hypothesis Test:
   - The property-based test from the bug report FAILS as reported
   - Input: strings=['\r']
   - Expected output: '\r'
   - Actual output: ''
   - Result: AssertionError - data is not preserved

2. Manual Test Cases:
   Both numpy.char.array() and numpy.char.asarray() exhibit identical stripping behavior:

   Strings that are completely stripped (become empty):
   - '\r' -> ''
   - '\n' -> ''
   - '\t' -> ''
   - '\x00' -> ''
   - ' ' (single space) -> ''
   - '  ' (multiple spaces) -> ''
   - '\r\n' -> ''

   Trailing whitespace is stripped:
   - 'hello\r' -> 'hello'
   - 'hello\n' -> 'hello'
   - 'hello\t' -> 'hello'
   - 'hello\x00' -> 'hello'
   - 'trailing  ' -> 'trailing'
   - '  both  ' -> '  both' (only trailing stripped)

   Leading/internal whitespace is preserved:
   - '\rhello' -> '\rhello' (preserved)
   - '\nhello' -> '\nhello' (preserved)
   - '\thello' -> '\thello' (preserved)
   - '\x00hello' -> '\x00hello' (preserved)
   - 'hello\tworld' -> 'hello\tworld' (preserved)
   - 'hello\r\nworld' -> 'hello\r\nworld' (preserved)
   - '  leading' -> '  leading' (preserved)

3. Pattern of Behavior:
   The functions consistently strip:
   - ALL trailing whitespace characters (space, \r, \n, \t, \x00)
   - Strings consisting entirely of whitespace become empty strings
   - Leading and internal whitespace is preserved

EFFECT:
This behavior causes silent data loss when:
- Processing text that needs to preserve line endings
- Working with data where trailing whitespace is significant
- Handling strings that consist only of whitespace characters

The behavior is consistent and reproducible across both numpy.char.array() and numpy.char.asarray().
