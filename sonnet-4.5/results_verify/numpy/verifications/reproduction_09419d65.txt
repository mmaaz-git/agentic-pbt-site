## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in the numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes function.

### Reproduction Results:

1. **Basic reproduction code**: The provided reproduction code runs and produces the exact error described:
   - Input: `np.array([(1, 2.0)], dtype=[('x', np.int32), ('y', np.float64)])`
   - Error: `NotImplementedError: Converting dtype('V12') to a ctypes type`
   - The error occurs at the exact location mentioned in the report

2. **Hypothesis test**: The property-based test using Hypothesis also fails consistently with the same error for all structured arrays tested, confirming this is a systematic issue, not an edge case.

3. **Verification of inconsistency**: I confirmed that:
   - `as_ctypes_type()` successfully converts structured dtypes to ctypes Structure classes
   - The created ctypes Structure has the correct fields (x as c_int, y as c_double)
   - Instances can be created and work correctly
   - However, `as_ctypes()` fails on arrays with these same structured dtypes

4. **Root cause verification**: The bug report correctly identifies the issue:
   - In line 599 of _ctypeslib.py, the code uses `ai["typestr"]`
   - For structured arrays, this returns a void type string like "|V12" (12 bytes void)
   - This void type cannot be converted by as_ctypes_type, causing the NotImplementedError
   - Meanwhile, the actual structured dtype can be successfully converted

The bug is reproducible exactly as described in the report, with the error occurring at the specified location and for the stated reason.
