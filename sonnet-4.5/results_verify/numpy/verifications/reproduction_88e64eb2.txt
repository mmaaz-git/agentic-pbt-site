REPRODUCTION REPORT
==================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in numpy.ma.make_mask.

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
- The provided Hypothesis test fails as expected
- Failing input: masked_array(data=[0.0], mask=[False])
- The assertion `mask.shape == arr.shape` fails because make_mask returns a scalar False instead of array([False])

MANUAL REPRODUCTION RESULTS:
The bug manifests exactly as described in the report:

1. Input: np.array([False]) with shape (1,)
   Output: scalar False with shape ()
   Expected: array([False]) with shape (1,)

2. Comparison shows inconsistent behavior:
   - make_mask([True]) → array([True]) with shape (1,)  [SHAPE PRESERVED]
   - make_mask([False]) → False with shape ()           [SHAPE LOST - BUG]
   - make_mask([False, True]) → array([False, True]) with shape (2,) [SHAPE PRESERVED]

3. Extended testing confirms the pattern:
   - Any array containing at least one True preserves its shape
   - Arrays containing only False values collapse to scalar False
   - This happens for 1D and 2D arrays: [False], [False, False], [[False]], etc.
   - With shrink=False, shape is always preserved as expected

4. The bug also affects ma.mask_or as reported:
   - mask_or([False], [False]) → scalar False (shape lost)
   - mask_or([True], [False]) → array([True]) (shape preserved)

EFFECT OF THE BUG:
This is a real inconsistency that violates the principle of least surprise. Code that expects make_mask to preserve array shapes will break when the input happens to be an all-False array. This creates unpredictable behavior in downstream code that depends on shape consistency.

The shrink parameter's documented purpose is to return nomask (which equals False) for all-False masks, but the documentation doesn't explicitly state that this should also collapse the dimensionality from an array to a scalar. The current behavior conflates two separate concepts:
1. Returning a special nomask value vs an array of False values
2. Preserving vs collapsing array dimensions

This bug makes it impossible to reliably predict the output shape without inspecting the values, which is problematic for array operations that depend on shape consistency.
