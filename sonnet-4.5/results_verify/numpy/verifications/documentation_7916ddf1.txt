DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION:
   The eliminate_quotes function has minimal documentation:
   - Docstring: "Replace quoted substrings of input string. Return a new string and a mapping of replacements."
   - No specification of what constitutes valid input
   - No mention of error handling or exceptions
   - No specification of behavior for malformed quotes

2. TEST SUITE ANALYSIS:
   From test_symbolic.py (lines 37-49), the test only covers valid cases:
   - Tests proper single-quoted strings: 'ABCD'
   - Tests proper double-quoted strings: "1234"
   - Tests strings with escaped quotes inside: "1\"2'AB'34"
   - Tests concatenation of properly quoted strings
   - All test cases use complete, matched quote pairs
   - No test cases for unmatched quotes or error conditions

3. USAGE CONTEXT:
   - The function is used internally in symbolic.py's parse() method (line 1313)
   - It's part of F2PY's symbolic expression parser for Fortran code
   - The function replaces quoted strings with placeholders to simplify parsing
   - insert_quotes() is the inverse operation to restore original strings

4. INFERRED PURPOSE:
   - The function is designed to handle Fortran string literals
   - It supports both single and double quotes
   - It handles kind-prefixed strings (e.g., MYSTRKIND_"ABC")
   - The regex patterns expect complete quoted strings with matching delimiters

5. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
   - No specification of error behavior for malformed input
   - No mention that unmatched quotes are unsupported
   - No documented exceptions or error conditions
   - The assertion use suggests an internal invariant check, not input validation

6. CONCLUSION:
   The documentation does not specify the expected behavior for unmatched quotes. The function appears designed only for well-formed quoted strings as would appear in valid Fortran code. The use of assertions rather than exceptions suggests the developers assumed the input would always be valid (coming from parsed Fortran code).
