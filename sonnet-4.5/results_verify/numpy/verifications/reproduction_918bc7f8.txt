## Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in numpy.strings.multiply function.

### Property-Based Test Results
The hypothesis test failed as expected with the input `['\x00']`:
- Input string: `'\x00'`
- Expected result after multiply by 3: `'\x00\x00\x00'`
- Actual result: `''` (empty string)

### Manual Test Case Results
Ran three test cases and found issues in all cases involving null characters:

1. `multiply('\x00', 3)`:
   - Expected: `'\x00\x00\x00'`
   - Got: `''` (empty string)
   - **Bug confirmed**: Complete failure to handle null-only strings

2. `multiply('\x00\x00', 2)`:
   - Expected: `'\x00\x00\x00\x00'`
   - Got: `''` (empty string)
   - **Bug confirmed**: Multiple null characters also result in empty string

3. `multiply('a\x00', 2)`:
   - Expected: `'a\x00a\x00'`
   - Got: `'aa'`
   - **Additional finding**: Not only do pure null strings fail, but mixed strings with nulls have the null characters stripped entirely

### Analysis
The bug is more extensive than initially reported. The function appears to:
1. Return empty strings when the input consists only of null characters
2. Strip null characters entirely from strings that contain both regular and null characters

This suggests the implementation is treating strings as C-style null-terminated strings, stopping at the first null character when processing. This is a significant deviation from Python's string handling, where null characters are valid characters within strings.

The bug is reproducible and the effect is that numpy.strings.multiply does not handle null characters correctly at all.
