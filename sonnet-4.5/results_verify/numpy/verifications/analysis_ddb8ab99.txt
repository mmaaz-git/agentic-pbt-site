## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Arguments for:**
- The documentation explicitly states "Compatible JSON strings can be produced by ``to_json()`` with a corresponding orient value", which creates a strong expectation of round-trip compatibility
- Silent data type conversion changes '0' (string) to 0 (integer) without warning, which is data corruption
- The behavior is inconsistent - mixed indices preserve strings while all-numeric-looking indices don't
- This affects real use cases where string labels like '0', '1', '2' are intentionally strings (e.g., categorical codes, IDs)
- The workaround exists (convert_axes=False) but users wouldn't know to use it without documentation

**Arguments against:**
- The convert_axes parameter exists and is documented to "convert axes to proper dtypes"
- Some might argue that inferring numeric types from numeric-looking strings is "helpful" behavior

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments for:**
- The code behavior might be considered "working as designed" with convert_axes=True being the intended default
- The documentation could be updated to clarify that round-trip compatibility requires convert_axes=False
- The convert_axes documentation could better explain what "proper dtypes" means

**Arguments against:**
- The documentation explicitly promises compatibility, which is violated
- This is more than just unclear documentation - it's unexpected behavior that loses data fidelity

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments for:**
- One could argue that preserving exact round-trip compatibility is a new feature request
- The ability to round-trip with type preservation could be seen as an enhancement

**Arguments against:**
- The documentation already claims this compatibility exists
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Arguments for:**
- The workaround (convert_axes=False) exists and works
- Some users might rely on the current type inference behavior
- Changing the default could break existing code

**Arguments against:**
- This violates documented behavior and user expectations
- Silent type conversion without warning is problematic
- The issue affects common use cases

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Arguments for:**
- The parameter convert_axes exists and its default behavior is documented
- Users could argue that numeric-looking strings being converted to numbers is expected

**Arguments against:**
- The documentation explicitly promises compatibility between to_json and read_json
- The behavior is inconsistent (mixed indices behave differently)
- String indices are a valid and common use case that should be preserved

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** or **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. The key deciding factor is the documentation's explicit claim:

"Compatible JSON strings can be produced by ``to_json()`` with a corresponding orient value."

This creates a reasonable expectation that round-tripping will preserve the DataFrame structure, including data types. The fact that string indices are silently converted violates this compatibility promise.

Given that:
1. The documentation makes an explicit promise of compatibility that is broken
2. The behavior causes silent data type changes (data integrity issue)
3. The behavior is inconsistent between mixed and all-numeric string indices
4. A simple workaround exists but is not documented

This should be categorized as either:
- **BUG**: If we interpret the documentation's compatibility promise as the intended behavior
- **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**: If we accept the current behavior but acknowledge the documentation is misleading

The stronger case is for **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** because:
1. The convert_axes behavior appears intentional (default=True for non-table orients)
2. Changing the default behavior could break existing code
3. The fix is primarily about clarifying expectations and documenting the workaround
4. The current behavior might be useful for some users who want automatic type inference
