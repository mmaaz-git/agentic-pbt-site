TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (incorrect report, wrong behavior expected):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE: None - the report is technically accurate
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - The bug is real and reproducible
   - The code explicitly intends to emit a deprecation warning (lines 173-184)
   - The documentation confirms NBitBase is deprecated
   - The test correctly expects a DeprecationWarning
   VERDICT: NOT INVALID

2. WONTFIX (trivial, uninteresting, or obscure):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - NBitBase is already deprecated and will be removed anyway
   - Users can still access NBitBase without issues (functionality works)
   - It's "just" a missing warning
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - Deprecation warnings are critical for users to migrate their code
   - Without the warning, users won't know to update their code before NBitBase is removed
   - This affects ALL users of NBitBase, not an obscure edge case
   - The fix is straightforward and low-risk
   VERDICT: NOT WONTFIX

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (asking for unsupported functionality):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE: None - deprecation warnings are already implemented
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - The deprecation warning is already coded and intended to work
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
   - The __getattr__ mechanism exists specifically to emit this warning
   VERDICT: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (documentation doesn't match code behavior):
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - The documentation says NBitBase is deprecated, but no warning is emitted
   - Could argue the docs should be updated to match actual behavior
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - The code INTENDS to emit the warning (lines 173-184 prove this)
   - This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue
   - The proper fix is to make the code work as intended, not change the docs
   - Deprecation warnings are standard practice and expected behavior
   VERDICT: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX

5. BUG (valid bug that should be fixed):
   WHY IT IS:
   - The code explicitly tries to emit a deprecation warning but fails
   - The failure mechanism is clear: direct import bypasses __getattr__
   - This breaks the deprecation process for all NBitBase users
   - The documentation and release notes confirm the deprecation
   - Users need this warning to migrate their code before NBitBase is removed
   - The bug report correctly identifies the problem and provides a valid fix
   - This is a contract violation: promised behavior (warning) doesn't occur
   WHY IT'S NOT: No valid reasons - this is clearly a bug
   VERDICT: THIS IS A BUG

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a clear BUG. The code contains explicit logic to emit a deprecation warning that is
completely bypassed due to an implementation error. This violates the documented deprecation
contract and prevents users from receiving important migration warnings. The bug report is
accurate, well-documented, and provides a valid fix.
