## Documentation Analysis for numpy.random.geometric

### NumPy Documentation Review:

1. **Official NumPy Documentation States:**
   - The geometric distribution "models the number of trials that must be run in order to achieve success"
   - "It is therefore supported on the positive integers, k = 1, 2, ..."
   - The probability mass function is: f(k) = (1 - p)^(k - 1) * p
   - Parameter p is described as "The probability of success of an individual trial"
   - p is specified as "float or array_like of floats"
   - The documentation states p must be "between 0 and 1"

2. **Mathematical Definition (Wikipedia/Standard References):**
   - The geometric distribution requires 0 < p â‰¤ 1
   - The support is k = 1, 2, 3, ... (positive integers only)
   - By mathematical definition, the geometric distribution can NEVER return negative values
   - It represents counting trials, which must be positive integers

3. **Key Documentation Findings:**

   **What the documentation DOES specify:**
   - The function should return positive integers (k = 1, 2, ...)
   - p should be between 0 and 1
   - The distribution models number of trials to first success

   **What the documentation DOES NOT specify:**
   - No explicit minimum value for p (just says "between 0 and 1")
   - No mention of potential overflow issues with very small p values
   - No warning about numerical limitations or edge cases
   - No statement that extremely small p values might cause errors

4. **Critical Analysis:**
   - The documentation clearly states the output must be positive integers starting from 1
   - A value of -9223372036854775808 (INT64_MIN) violates the documented behavior
   - Even if p=1e-100 is an extreme value, it is still mathematically valid (0 < 1e-100 < 1)
   - The documentation provides no disclaimer about numerical limitations for small p values

5. **Conclusion:**
   The behavior observed (returning negative values) directly contradicts the documented specification that the geometric distribution is "supported on the positive integers, k = 1, 2, ...". The documentation makes an unequivocal mathematical statement about the support of the distribution, which the implementation violates.
