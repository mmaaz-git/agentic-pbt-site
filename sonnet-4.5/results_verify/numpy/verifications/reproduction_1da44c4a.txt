REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and behaves exactly as described.

Test Results:
-------------
1. When replacing the ENTIRE string with a longer replacement, numpy.strings.replace FAILS:
   - replace('0', '0', '00'): Expected '00', got '0'
   - replace('a', 'a', 'aa'): Expected 'aa', got 'a'
   - replace('hello', 'hello', 'hellohello'): Expected 'hellohello', got 'hello'

2. When replacing PART of a string (even with longer replacement), it WORKS:
   - replace('hello', 'l', 'll'): Correctly returns 'hellllo'

Key Pattern:
-----------
The bug occurs specifically when:
- The pattern to replace (old) equals the entire string (s == old)
- AND the replacement (new) is longer than the original (len(new) > len(old))

In these cases, numpy.strings.replace returns the original string unchanged rather than performing the replacement.

The property-based test using Hypothesis also fails consistently on this pattern, confirming that numpy.strings.replace does not match the behavior of Python's built-in str.replace() for these cases.

This is a clear behavioral discrepancy where the function silently fails to perform the expected operation without raising any errors or warnings.
