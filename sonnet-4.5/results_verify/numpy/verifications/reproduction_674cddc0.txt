## Reproduction Results

### Bug Report Test Execution

I successfully reproduced the bug using the provided test cases:

#### Test 1: Direct Access to npt.NBitBase
```python
_ = npt.NBitBase
```
Result: **No warning issued** (0 warnings captured)

#### Test 2: Access via __getattr__
```python
_ = npt.__getattr__('NBitBase')
```
Result: **Warning issued correctly** (1 DeprecationWarning captured with expected message)

#### Test 3: Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis test failed as expected:
```
AssertionError: Expected deprecation warning for NBitBase but got none
Falsifying example: test_deprecated_attributes_trigger_warnings(attr_name='NBitBase')
```

### Additional Verification
- NBitBase is in __all__: True
- NBitBase is in module globals: True
- NBitBase is directly accessible: True

### Technical Analysis
The bug report is technically accurate:
1. **Normal attribute access** (npt.NBitBase) finds the attribute in the module's namespace immediately, bypassing __getattr__
2. **Direct __getattr__ call** correctly triggers the deprecation warning
3. The Python attribute resolution mechanism dictates that __getattr__ is only called when an attribute is NOT found through normal lookup

### Impact
Users accessing `npt.NBitBase` in their code will NOT receive the intended deprecation warning. This defeats the purpose of the deprecation notice, as users won't be informed that NBitBase is deprecated and should migrate to alternatives.

The bug report's claim that "this warning will never fire" is correct for normal usage patterns. The warning code exists but is unreachable through standard attribute access.
