## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Property-Based Test Reproduction
The hypothesis test fails as reported. When running the test with `shape='0'`, the ndpointer function accepts the string and converts it to `_shape_=('0',)` instead of raising a TypeError or ValueError. The test correctly identifies that the function is accepting invalid input types.

### Manual Example Reproduction
All the manual examples behave exactly as described in the bug report:

1. **String shape 'abc'**: Accepted and converted to `_shape_ = ('a', 'b', 'c')` - treating each character as a shape dimension
2. **Dict shape {'x': 1, 'y': 2}**: Accepted and converted to `_shape_ = ('x', 'y')` - using dictionary keys as shape dimensions
3. **Set shape**: Also accepted and converted individual elements to shape tuple
4. **String '100'**: Converted to `_shape_ = ('1', '0', '0')` - a nonsensical shape of individual characters rather than the integer 100

### Error Messages
When attempting to use these malformed ndpointer types with actual numpy arrays, the error messages are indeed confusing:
- Trying to validate a (3,) array against a pointer with shape "abc" gives: "array must have shape ('a', 'b', 'c')"
- This error message is meaningless to users who may have accidentally passed a string

### Impact
The bug is real and has the following effects:
1. The function silently accepts invalid types (strings, dicts, sets) for the shape parameter
2. These invalid types are converted to nonsensical shape tuples containing non-integer elements
3. When these malformed pointers are used, they produce confusing error messages that don't help users identify the root cause
4. A particularly problematic case is passing numeric strings like "100" which creates shape ('1', '0', '0') instead of shape (100,)

The bug report's assessment is accurate - the function is accepting invalid input types and producing confusing behavior rather than failing fast with a clear error message.
