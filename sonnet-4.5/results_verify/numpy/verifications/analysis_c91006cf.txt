TRIAGE ANALYSIS FOR numpy.strings.rfind NULL CHARACTER BUG

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation could be interpreted to not cover null characters as a special case, and perhaps NumPy has chosen to handle null characters differently for some internal reason. Maybe null characters are considered string terminators in the underlying C implementation and thus have undefined behavior.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states that rfind returns -1 when a substring is not found, with no exceptions mentioned for null characters. The function accepts null characters as valid input without error, and Python's str.rfind handles null characters correctly. The behavior directly contradicts the documented specification of returning -1 for not found.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Null character handling might be considered an obscure edge case that rarely occurs in practice. Most string operations don't involve searching for null characters, and fixing this might require significant changes to the underlying string handling code. The issue might be deeply rooted in how NumPy handles string termination at the C level.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not an obscure error message or minor inconsistency - it's a fundamental violation of the function's documented contract. The function returns completely wrong values (string length instead of -1, wrong indices when found). This affects data correctness, not just aesthetics or convenience. The behavior is inconsistent with Python's standard library, which NumPy claims to mirror.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Perhaps the documentation should explicitly state that null characters have special handling or undefined behavior in NumPy string operations. The documentation could be updated to warn users about this limitation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation already clearly states the expected behavior (return -1 when not found), and this applies to all substrings including null characters. Changing the documentation to match the buggy behavior would be backwards - the code should match the documented specification, not the other way around. This would also break compatibility with Python's str.rfind.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting null character searches could be viewed as a new feature if NumPy never intended to support them. The request could be to add proper null character handling as an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function already accepts null characters as input without throwing an error, indicating it intends to support them. This is not asking for new functionality but for the existing functionality to work correctly according to its documented specification. The feature (searching for substrings) already exists; it just doesn't work correctly for certain inputs.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function clearly violates its documented contract by returning string length instead of -1 when null characters are not found. It provides incorrect results even when null characters ARE found in the string. The behavior is inconsistent with Python's str.rfind, which numpy.strings.rfind is meant to emulate for arrays. The function accepts the input without error but produces wrong results, which is a classic bug pattern. Regular substring searches work correctly, showing this is a specific problem with null character handling.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There could be an undocumented design decision to handle null characters specially due to C string termination conventions. Perhaps this behavior is intentional for some compatibility reason with underlying libraries.

## Overall Consideration

This is clearly a BUG. The numpy.strings.rfind function has a well-defined contract documented in the official NumPy documentation: return the highest index where a substring is found, or -1 if not found. This contract makes no exception for null characters or any other special characters. The function accepts null character input without error, indicating it intends to handle them, but produces demonstrably incorrect results.

The bug is not a minor inconsistency or edge case - it returns completely wrong values. When searching for a null character that doesn't exist, instead of returning -1 as documented, it returns the string length. When null characters ARE present, it often returns the wrong index. This violates the fundamental contract of the function and produces incorrect data that could lead to serious errors in data processing pipelines.

Furthermore, numpy.strings functions are meant to provide array-based equivalents of Python's string methods. Python's str.rfind handles null characters correctly, returning -1 when not found and the correct index when found. Users reasonably expect NumPy to behave consistently with Python's standard library. The fact that regular substring searches work correctly while null character searches fail systematically indicates this is an implementation bug, not a design choice. This should be filed as a BUG that needs to be fixed to maintain correctness and compatibility.
