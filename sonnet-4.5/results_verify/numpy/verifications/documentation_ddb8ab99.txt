## Documentation Analysis

After reviewing the pandas documentation for both `read_json()` and `to_json()`, here are the key findings:

### read_json() Documentation

1. **Key Statement**: The documentation explicitly states:
   > "Compatible JSON strings can be produced by ``to_json()`` with a corresponding orient value."

   This statement strongly implies round-trip compatibility between the two functions.

2. **convert_axes Parameter**:
   - Type: bool, default None
   - Description: "Try to convert the axes to the proper dtypes."
   - Default behavior: "For all ``orient`` values except ``'table'``, default is True."

   The documentation indicates that by default, `convert_axes=True` (when None), which means pandas will attempt to infer and convert axis dtypes automatically.

3. **No Warning About Round-Trip Issues**: The documentation does not warn users that string indices/columns that look like numbers will be silently converted to integers during round-tripping, despite claiming compatibility with `to_json()`.

### to_json() Documentation

1. **Cross-Reference**: The documentation states:
   > "See Also: read_json : Convert a JSON string to pandas object."

   This suggests these functions are meant to work together.

2. **Orient Descriptions**: The documentation describes the JSON format for each orient value but doesn't mention any type conversion issues when round-tripping.

### Documentation Gaps

1. **Missing Round-Trip Warning**: Neither function's documentation warns that round-tripping may not preserve string indices/columns that appear numeric.

2. **Incomplete convert_axes Description**: The `convert_axes` parameter documentation doesn't explain:
   - What constitutes "proper dtypes"
   - That numeric-looking strings will be converted to integers
   - The inconsistent behavior with mixed indices

3. **No Mention of Workaround**: The documentation doesn't inform users that they need to use `convert_axes=False` to preserve exact round-trip compatibility for string indices.

### Conclusion

The documentation creates a reasonable expectation that `to_json()` and `read_json()` with matching orient values will preserve DataFrame structure, including index/column types. The claim of "Compatible JSON strings" strongly suggests round-trip compatibility. The silent conversion of string indices violates this expectation and is not adequately documented.
