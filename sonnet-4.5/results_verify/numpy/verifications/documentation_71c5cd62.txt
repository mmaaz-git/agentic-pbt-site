DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. NUMPY.REC.FROMRECORDS DOCUMENTATION:
From official NumPy documentation and docstring:
- Purpose: "Create a recarray from a list of records in text form"
- Parameters include recList (sequence) which can contain heterogeneous data
- No explicit mention of requirements for non-empty lists
- No documented restriction against empty sequences
- No warning about empty list behavior

2. NUMPY.REC.FROMARRAYS DOCUMENTATION:
From the docstring:
- Purpose: "Create a record array from a (flat) list of arrays"
- Takes arrayList parameter: "List of array-like objects"
- Shape parameter: "If not provided, inferred from arrayList[0]"
- This documentation hints at potential issue but doesn't explicitly state empty lists aren't supported

3. EMPTY ARRAY SUPPORT IN NUMPY:
NumPy generally supports empty arrays across its API:
- Empty ndarrays are valid: np.array([])
- Empty structured arrays are valid: np.array([], dtype=[...])
- Empty record arrays are valid: np.recarray(shape=(0,), ...)
- Many NumPy functions handle empty inputs gracefully

4. PRINCIPLE OF LEAST SURPRISE:
- Users would reasonably expect fromrecords to handle empty lists
- Python's built-in functions generally handle empty sequences
- Other NumPy functions handle empty inputs
- The function name doesn't suggest a non-empty requirement

5. CONSISTENCY WITH NUMPY ECOSYSTEM:
- np.rec.fromarrays CAN handle empty inputs when given explicit empty arrays [[], []]
- np.array handles empty lists with structured dtypes
- np.recarray explicitly supports shape=(0,) for empty arrays
- The inconsistency between fromrecords and fromarrays is unexpected

6. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
- No explicit statement that empty lists are unsupported
- No documented minimum size requirement
- No example showing empty list handling
- No warning about IndexError on empty input

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not indicate that empty lists should cause crashes. Given NumPy's general support for empty arrays and the lack of documented restrictions, users would reasonably expect np.rec.fromrecords([]) to return an empty record array rather than crash with IndexError. This appears to be an undocumented limitation that conflicts with NumPy's general patterns.
