DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Official Documentation Review:
------------------------------

1. NumPy Matrix Class Documentation:
   - Clearly states: "A matrix is a specialized 2-D array that retains its 2-D nature through operations"
   - Emphasizes it is designed for 2-dimensional data
   - No mention of handling 3D inputs or dimension squeezing behavior
   - No documented difference between array vs list input handling

2. Deprecation Status:
   - Documentation includes clear warning: "It is no longer recommended to use this class, even for linear algebra"
   - States: "The class may be removed in the future"
   - Recommends using regular arrays instead

3. Input Type Documentation:
   - States it accepts "array_like or string"
   - array_like includes both numpy arrays and lists
   - No documented behavioral differences between input types

4. Dimensional Requirements:
   - Documentation explicitly says it's a "specialized 2-D array"
   - No documentation about accepting 3D inputs
   - No documentation about automatic dimension squeezing

Critical Finding:
-----------------
The documentation does NOT specify:
- That 3D inputs should be rejected or accepted
- That dimension squeezing should occur
- That array and list inputs might behave differently

However, the fundamental principle is clear: matrix is meant to be 2-dimensional. The fact that it sometimes accepts 3D arrays (when passed as ndarray) appears to be an undocumented implementation detail, not an intended feature.

The documentation strongly implies that all inputs should result in 2D matrices, and there's no reason users should expect different behavior based on input type (array vs list) for the same logical data structure.
