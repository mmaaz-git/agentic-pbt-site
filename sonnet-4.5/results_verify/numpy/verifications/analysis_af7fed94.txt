## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. **Data Loss**: The function silently strips null characters, causing actual data loss without warning.
2. **Inconsistent with Python**: Violates the principle of least surprise - numpy.strings.add is documented as equivalent to '+' operator, but behaves differently from Python's string concatenation.
3. **Undocumented Behavior**: Documentation doesn't mention that null characters will be stripped.
4. **Breaks Mathematical Properties**: Violates basic concatenation properties like length preservation (len(a+b) != len(a)+len(b) when nulls are present).
5. **Inconsistent Internal Behavior**: Nulls in the middle of strings are preserved, but edge nulls are stripped - this inconsistency suggests unintended behavior.
6. **Real-World Impact**: Null bytes are valid in many contexts (binary data, protocol delimiters, etc.) and their silent removal can cause serious issues.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Could be argued this is C-string compatibility behavior (though not documented as such)

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. Could argue that NumPy string arrays have different semantics than Python strings
2. Might be intentional C-string compatibility (though undocumented)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior causes actual data loss
- No documentation suggests this is intended behavior
- Inconsistent handling (middle nulls preserved, edge nulls stripped) suggests a bug rather than design

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. Null bytes in strings might be considered an edge case
2. The numpy.char module is marked as legacy (though numpy.strings has the same issue)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - null bytes are valid string characters in Python
- Data loss is a serious issue that shouldn't be ignored
- The replacement module (numpy.strings) has the same bug

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. If this is intended behavior, the documentation should warn about null stripping
2. Users need to know their data might be modified

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior appears to be a bug, not a documentation issue
- Simply documenting data loss doesn't make it acceptable
- The inconsistent behavior (middle vs edge nulls) suggests implementation bug

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could frame it as "requesting support for null characters in concatenation"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This isn't a new feature - it's fixing broken existing functionality
- Python strings already support nulls, so this should too
- The function already partially works with nulls (in the middle), just not at edges

### Conclusion:
This should be classified as **BUG** because:

1. **Clear Data Loss**: The function silently removes valid data without warning or documentation.

2. **Violates Documented Contract**: Documentation claims equivalence to Python's '+' operator, but behavior differs significantly.

3. **Inconsistent Implementation**: The fact that middle nulls are preserved while edge nulls are stripped strongly suggests an implementation bug rather than intentional design. If null stripping were intentional, it would be consistent.

4. **Not an Edge Case**: Null bytes are valid Python string characters used in many real-world scenarios (binary protocols, data serialization, testing, etc.).

5. **Breaks Fundamental Properties**: String concatenation should preserve all input data. Silent data modification violates basic expectations.

The bug likely stems from improper handling of Python strings as C-strings somewhere in the implementation, causing null bytes to be treated as terminators rather than valid characters.
