## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis test**: The property-based test fails as reported with the exact same failing input:
   - Input: `string_list=['0'], start=0, step=2`
   - Expected: '0' (from Python slice '0'[0:None:2])
   - Actual: '' (empty string from numpy.strings.slice)

2. **Manual reproduction cases**:

   Test 1: `ns.slice(["hello", "world"], 0, None, 2)`
   - Expected: ['hlo', 'wrd'] (matching Python's "hello"[0:None:2])
   - Actual: ['', ''] (empty strings)

   Test 2: `ns.slice(['0'], 0, None, 2)`
   - Expected: ['0'] (matching Python's '0'[0:None:2])
   - Actual: [''] (empty string)

3. **Additional finding**: The bug also affects cases without step parameter:
   Test 3: `ns.slice(["hello", "world"], 2, None)`
   - Expected: ['llo', 'rld'] (matching Python's "hello"[2:None])
   - Actual: ['he', 'wo'] (incorrect slicing)

### Root Cause Verification

The bug is located in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/_core/strings.py` lines 1804-1806:

```python
if stop is None:
    stop = start
    start = None
```

This swap logic is meant to handle the single-argument case (e.g., `slice(3)` â†’ `slice(None, 3)`), mimicking Python's built-in slice behavior. However, it incorrectly triggers in two problematic scenarios:

1. When `stop=None` is explicitly passed with a `step` parameter
2. When `stop=None` is explicitly passed without a `step` parameter (but with `start` specified)

### Effect of the Bug

When `ns.slice(arr, 0, None, 2)` is called:
1. The swap logic changes it to: start=None, stop=0, step=2
2. Line 1818 then sets start=0 (since step > 0)
3. This results in slicing [0:0:2] which returns empty strings

Similarly, when `ns.slice(arr, 2, None)` is called:
1. The swap logic changes it to: start=None, stop=2, step=None
2. This results in slicing [:2] instead of [2:], giving the wrong portion of the string

The bug causes numpy.strings.slice to behave differently from Python's standard slicing when None is explicitly passed as the stop parameter.
