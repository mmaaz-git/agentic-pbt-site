REPRODUCTION RESULTS

The bug has been successfully reproduced. Both the Hypothesis test and the direct reproduction code confirm the issue.

## Hypothesis Test Results

The provided Hypothesis test fails on the first example with 'ß':
- Input: 'ß'
- numpy.char.upper result: 'S' (truncated)
- Python str.upper result: 'SS' (correct)

The test also found another failing case with 'ŉ' where the uppercase expansion is truncated.

## Direct Reproduction Results

The direct reproduction code confirms the bug clearly:

1. For 'ß' (German eszett):
   - Input: 'ß' (dtype <U1)
   - numpy.char.upper result: 'S' (dtype <U1)
   - Expected (Python str.upper): 'SS'
   - The result is truncated to fit the original dtype size

2. Additional test cases that all fail similarly:
   - 'ﬁ' -> numpy: 'F', expected: 'FI'
   - 'ﬂ' -> numpy: 'F', expected: 'FL'
   - 'ﬃ' -> numpy: 'F', expected: 'FFI'
   - 'ﬄ' -> numpy: 'F', expected: 'FFL'
   - 'ﬅ' -> numpy: 'S', expected: 'ST'
   - 'ﬆ' -> numpy: 'S', expected: 'ST'

## Key Observations

1. The input array has dtype '<U1' (1 Unicode character)
2. The output array maintains the same dtype '<U1'
3. When uppercase conversion expands the character count (e.g., 'ß' -> 'SS'), numpy.char.upper truncates the result to fit the original dtype size
4. This happens silently without any warning or error
5. The truncation always keeps only the first character of the expanded result

The bug is confirmed: numpy.char.upper does not properly handle Unicode characters that expand when converted to uppercase, resulting in silent data corruption through truncation.
