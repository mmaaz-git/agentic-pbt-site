## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation
The parse method documentation is minimal:
```
parse(s, language=<Language.C: 2>)
    Parse a Fortran expression to a Expr.
```

Key observations:
1. The function is described as parsing "a Fortran expression" but defaults to C language mode
2. No explicit documentation about round-trip guarantees
3. No documentation about how ** should be handled in different language modes

### Code Comments
From the source code comments (lines 14-21):
- The module is designed to parse expressions for "Fortran expressions to solve dimensions specifications"
- It explicitly states support for "exponentiation (**)"
- It mentions ".pyf files may contain C expressions that support here is implemented as well"

### Language Modes
The code supports three language modes:
- Python (0)
- Fortran (1)
- C (2) - the default

### Behavior by Design
The source code reveals intentional different handling of ** by language:
- In Fortran mode: ** is recognized as the power operator
- In C mode: ** is not a valid operator (C uses pow() function, not **)
- The parser appears to intentionally parse ** as two separate * operators in C mode

### Documentation Inconsistency
The most significant issue is that the function is documented as parsing "a Fortran expression" but defaults to C language mode. This creates confusion:
1. Users expect Fortran expression parsing (including ** operator)
2. The default behavior uses C mode where ** is not valid
3. The tostring() method can output ** notation regardless of language mode

### Missing Documentation
The documentation does not specify:
- Round-trip guarantees or expectations
- Language-specific operator handling
- The semantic difference between C and Fortran parsing modes
- That ** is only valid in Fortran mode, not C mode

The lack of clear documentation about language modes and operator support is a significant issue that contributes to user confusion.
