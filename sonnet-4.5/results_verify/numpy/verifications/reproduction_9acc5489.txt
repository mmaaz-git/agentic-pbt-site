## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Environment
- NumPy version: 2.3.0
- Python version: 3.13

### Test 1: Direct Access to NBitBase
```python
result = npt.NBitBase
```
**Result**: No warning emitted (0 warnings caught)
**Expected**: 1 DeprecationWarning
**Status**: BUG CONFIRMED

### Test 2: Access via getattr()
```python
result = getattr(npt, "NBitBase")
```
**Result**: No warning emitted (0 warnings caught)
**Expected**: 1 DeprecationWarning
**Status**: BUG CONFIRMED

### Test 3: Module Internals Check
- `'NBitBase' in npt.__dict__`: True
- This confirms NBitBase is directly in the module's dictionary, bypassing __getattr__

### Test 4: Hypothesis Test
The property-based test from the bug report was executed and failed as expected:
- Assertion: "Expected deprecation warning to be emitted"
- Result: Test failed, confirming no warning was emitted

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue is confirmed in numpy/typing/__init__.py:
- Line 160: `from numpy._typing import ArrayLike, DTypeLike, NBitBase, NDArray`
  - This imports NBitBase directly into the module namespace
- Lines 173-184: Contains __getattr__ hook to emit deprecation warning
  - This code is never reached because NBitBase is already in __dict__

Python's attribute lookup order:
1. Check instance __dict__ (finds NBitBase immediately)
2. Check class __dict__
3. Call __getattr__ (never reached)

### Fix Validation
A simulation of the proposed fix was tested:
- Importing NBitBase as _NBitBase (private)
- Removing it from direct module namespace
- Accessing via __getattr__ only

**Result**: The fix successfully emits the deprecation warning

### Conclusion
The bug is 100% reproducible and the root cause is correctly identified. The deprecation warning mechanism is implemented but bypassed due to the direct import. The proposed fix would resolve the issue.
