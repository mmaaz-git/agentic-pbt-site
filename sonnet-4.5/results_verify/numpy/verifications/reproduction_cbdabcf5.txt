# Reproduction of Bug Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug as reported. The issue occurs when dealing with extremely small (subnormal) values that cause the default tolerance calculation to underflow to exactly 0.0.

## Reproduction Results

### 1. Property-Based Test Failure
The hypothesis test with the specific failing input confirms the violation of the mathematical property:
- Matrix A has rank 1
- Matrix B has rank 1
- Their product AB has rank 2
- This violates the fundamental property: rank(AB) ≤ min(rank(A), rank(B))

### 2. Tolerance Underflow Demonstration
The reproduction code confirms:
- For a matrix with singular values [2e-323, 5e-324]
- The default tolerance calculation: 2 * 2e-323 * 2.22e-16 = 0.0 (underflow)
- With default tolerance (0.0): rank = 2 (counts all non-zero values)
- With explicit tolerance 1e-15: rank = 0 (correctly identifies near-zero matrix)
- With explicit tolerance 1e-300: rank = 0 (correctly identifies near-zero matrix)

### 3. Root Cause
The issue occurs because:
1. When dealing with subnormal values (like 5e-324, which is the smallest positive float64), the default tolerance calculation can underflow
2. The formula: S.max() * max(M, N) * eps multiplies very small numbers
3. When this underflows to exactly 0.0, the comparison S > tol becomes S > 0.0
4. This causes any non-zero value (even 5e-324) to be counted as significant

### 4. Impact
The bug causes mathematically incorrect results by:
- Violating the rank product theorem: rank(AB) ≤ min(rank(A), rank(B))
- Treating numerically zero matrices as having full rank
- Providing inconsistent results between default and explicit tolerances
- Silently producing incorrect results without warning about underflow

The bug is confirmed and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
