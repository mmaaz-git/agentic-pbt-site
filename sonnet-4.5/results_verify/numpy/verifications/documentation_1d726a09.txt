## Documentation Analysis

I have reviewed the numpy.linalg.eig documentation to understand what behavior is specified and guaranteed.

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Function Purpose**: `numpy.linalg.eig` computes eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square array, where the fundamental equation `a @ v = w * v` should be satisfied.

2. **Mathematical Guarantee**: The documentation explicitly states:
   - "The number `w` is an eigenvalue of `a` if there exists a vector `v` such that `a @ v = w * v`"
   - "Thus, the arrays `a`, `eigenvalues`, and `eigenvectors` satisfy the equations `a @ eigenvectors[:,i] = eigenvalues[i] * eigenvectors[:,i]`"

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Uses LAPACK's `_geev` routines for general square arrays
   - Eigenvectors are normalized to unit length

4. **Warnings About Numerical Issues**:
   - The documentation mentions "Be careful about round-off error!" with an example showing 1e-9 perturbations
   - States that eigenvector columns "may not be of maximum rank" and "some of the columns may be linearly dependent, although round-off error may obscure that fact"
   - Notes that for non-Hermitian normal matrices, scipy.linalg.schur is preferred for numerical stability

5. **What Is NOT Documented**:
   - No mention of special handling requirements for matrices with very small values
   - No warning about failures for ill-conditioned or rank-deficient matrices
   - No documented threshold below which the algorithm may fail
   - No mention that subnormal or very small normal values may cause incorrect results
   - No documentation that the eigenvalue equation might not be satisfied in certain cases

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not warn users that:
1. Matrices containing values smaller than ~1e-20 may produce completely incorrect eigenvalues
2. The fundamental eigenvalue equation `A @ v = Î» @ v` may be violated with large errors (not just round-off)
3. Rank-deficient matrices with small non-zero values may have their zero eigenvalues incorrectly computed

### Conclusion

The documentation creates an expectation that the eigenvalue equation will be satisfied (within reasonable numerical tolerance), but does not document this significant failure mode for matrices with very small values. This represents either:
- A bug in the implementation (it violates the documented mathematical guarantee)
- A documentation deficiency (failure to document known limitations)
