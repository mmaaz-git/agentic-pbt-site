## Bug Report Analysis

### Summary of the Issue
The bug report states that `numpy.f2py.symbolic.Expr.tostring()` produces syntactically invalid output `x * *2` instead of proper power notation for expressions like `x**2`.

### Analysis by Category

#### 1. BUG - Why this might be a valid bug:
- **Invalid syntax generation**: The output `x * *2` is syntactically invalid in C, Fortran, and Python
- **Module purpose violated**: The module is meant to handle symbolic expressions for code generation, but produces unusable code
- **Documented operation fails**: Exponentiation with `**` is explicitly listed as a supported operation in the source comments
- **Default behavior broken**: Using the default parameters (`fromstring('x**2')`) produces incorrect results
- **Cross-language output error**: Even when parsing in C mode, outputting to Fortran/Python should produce valid Fortran/Python syntax, but it doesn't

**Strength**: STRONG - This is the most likely categorization.

#### 2. INVALID - Why this might be invalid:
- **Wrong input for C**: The `**` operator doesn't exist in C, so using it when parsing C code could be considered user error
- **Language mismatch**: User is parsing with C mode (default) but using Fortran/Python syntax
- **Works with correct language**: When using `fromstring('x**2', language=Language.Fortran)`, it works correctly

**Strength**: WEAK - The module should either reject invalid input or handle it correctly.

#### 3. WONTFIX - Why this might be wontfix:
- **Obscure edge case**: Users rarely parse `**` in C mode since it's not valid C
- **Workaround exists**: Users can specify the correct language parameter
- **Accidental round-trip**: The malformed output accidentally round-trips correctly

**Strength**: WEAK - The issue affects default behavior and produces invalid syntax.

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why this might be a documentation issue:
- **Unclear language semantics**: Documentation doesn't clarify what syntax is valid for each language mode
- **Missing warnings**: No documentation warns about using `**` in C parsing mode
- **Ambiguous purpose**: Unclear if the module is meant to parse actual C/Fortran code or a unified symbolic language

**Strength**: MODERATE - Better documentation would help, but the core issue is still a bug.

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why this might be a feature request:
- **New capability needed**: Adding proper `**` support in C parsing mode
- **Cross-language translation**: Converting between C's pow() and Fortran/Python's `**`
- **Enhanced parser**: Detecting and converting non-native operators

**Strength**: WEAK - The feature is already supposed to be supported according to comments.

### Technical Analysis

The root cause is clear from code inspection:

1. In C parsing mode, the condition `if self.language is not Language.C and '**' in r:` prevents the exponentiation handler from running
2. The `**` gets parsed as two separate `*` operators
3. This creates a malformed internal representation mixing multiplication and dereferencing
4. The tostring() method faithfully outputs this malformed representation

The fix would involve either:
- Properly parsing `**` as exponentiation even in C mode, then outputting as `pow()`
- Rejecting `**` in C parsing mode with a clear error
- Documenting that different syntax must be used for different language modes

### Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. The module produces syntactically invalid output for a documented operation when using default parameters. The output cannot be used in any of the target languages (C, Fortran, or Python), defeating the purpose of a symbolic expression module meant for code generation.

The fact that it affects the default behavior (`fromstring('x**2')` with no language specified) and produces unusable output makes this a clear bug rather than a documentation issue or user error.
