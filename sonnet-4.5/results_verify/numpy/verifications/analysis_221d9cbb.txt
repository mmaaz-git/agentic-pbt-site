## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation states this is a "lazy" parser and doesn't specify how it should handle expressions like `-1 + -1`. The parser's behavior of treating ambiguous cases as symbols (with warnings) could be considered a valid interpretation of "lazy parsing". Since the documentation doesn't promise to correctly parse all arithmetic expressions, especially those with consecutive operators, this could be working as designed.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The parser is specifically designed for arithmetic operations according to its docstring. The expression `-1 + -1` is valid arithmetic that equals `-2`. The fact that it generates warnings and produces incorrect results (with phantom empty symbols) suggests the parser recognizes something is wrong but fails to handle it properly. This is clearly incorrect behavior for an arithmetic parser.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This issue only occurs with a specific pattern (negative numbers after operators without parentheses) that has a simple workaround (use parentheses). The parser already emits warnings alerting users to the issue. For F2PY's use case of parsing Fortran dimension expressions, this edge case might be considered unimportant enough to leave as-is, especially since Fortran code generators could easily add parentheses.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue affects basic arithmetic operations that users would reasonably expect to work. Variable substitution commonly produces these patterns, making this more than just an edge case. The warnings indicate the parser knows something is wrong but continues with incorrect behavior rather than fixing it. This is not a trivial formatting issue but a fundamental parsing error.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify how consecutive operators should be handled, leaving the behavior undefined. If the current behavior is intentional (treating `+ -` as requiring an operand between them), then the documentation should explicitly state that negative numbers after operators require parentheses. The warning message shows this is known behavior that just needs documenting.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The parser is producing objectively incorrect results for valid arithmetic expressions. The warnings indicate this is recognized as problematic behavior, not an intentional design choice. Documenting broken behavior doesn't fix the underlying issue that `-1 + -1` should evaluate to `-2`, not `-2 + <empty_symbol>`.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting negative literals after operators without parentheses could be viewed as an enhancement rather than a bug fix. The current parser might have been designed with simpler grammar rules that don't distinguish between binary and unary minus. Adding this capability would be extending the parser to handle more complex expressions.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Basic arithmetic operations like `-1 + -1` are not feature requests - they're fundamental functionality for an arithmetic expression parser. This isn't asking for new capability but for correct parsing of standard mathematical notation. The parser already attempts to handle these cases (generating warnings), indicating this is expected functionality that's broken.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The parser fails to correctly evaluate valid arithmetic expressions like `-1 + -1`, producing malformed results with phantom empty symbols. The system generates warnings acknowledging the parsing failure but continues with incorrect behavior. This breaks variable substitution in practical use cases. For an arithmetic expression parser, failing to parse basic arithmetic is a clear bug. The expression `-1 + -1 = -2` is unambiguous mathematics that the parser handles incorrectly.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise to handle all arithmetic expressions, only that it's a "lazy" parser. The behavior is consistent and predictable (always fails for `<op> -<number>` patterns). A workaround exists (parentheses), and warnings are provided. The F2PY context might not require this specific pattern to work correctly.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at all considerations, this issue presents a parser that fails to correctly handle standard arithmetic notation. While the documentation is vague about expected behavior, an arithmetic expression parser that cannot correctly parse `-1 + -1` has a fundamental flaw. The parser recognizes the problem (generates warnings) but produces incorrect results rather than fixing the tokenization logic.

The key question is whether F2PY's symbolic parser is meant to be a general arithmetic parser or just a minimal parser for Fortran dimension expressions. The docstring says it resolves "arithmetic operations," which suggests general arithmetic should work. The fact that it attempts to parse these expressions (rather than rejecting them) but gets them wrong indicates buggy behavior rather than intentional limitations.

However, given that this is F2PY's internal symbolic parser primarily used for Fortran dimension expressions, and that Fortran code rarely uses this specific pattern in dimension specifications, this could be considered a low-priority edge case. The warnings make it clear when the issue occurs, and the parentheses workaround is straightforward. This leans toward WONTFIX rather than BUG, as it's an obscure case with minimal real-world impact on F2PY's primary use case.
