## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in scipy.integrate.simpson. The issue is confirmed to exist.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test failed exactly as described in the bug report, with the same failing input `y = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]`.

2. **Manual Reproduction**: The manual example code produces the exact output claimed in the bug report:
   - Forward integration: 0.4166666666666667
   - Backward integration: -0.3333333333333333
   - Expected backward: -0.4166666666666667
   - Difference: 0.08333333333333337

3. **Additional Testing**: I conducted further tests to understand the pattern:
   - With odd number of points (N=5): The reversal property holds correctly (difference = 0.0)
   - With even number of points (N=6): The reversal property is violated (difference = 1.0)
   - This confirms the bug occurs specifically when N is even (N % 2 == 0)

### Mathematical Expectation

The fundamental property being violated is:
∫[a,b] f(x)dx = -∫[b,a] f(x)dx

This is a core mathematical property of definite integrals. When we reverse the integration limits, the result should be negated. This property should hold for any numerical integration method claiming to approximate definite integrals.

### Bug Confirmation

The bug is real and reproducible:
- It consistently occurs when the number of sample points is even
- It does not occur when the number of sample points is odd
- The violation of the reversal property is significant (not just floating-point rounding errors)
- The issue appears to stem from asymmetric correction formulas applied for even N cases
