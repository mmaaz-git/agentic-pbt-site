# Documentation Analysis

## Official NumPy Documentation

### NBitBase Deprecation Status
The official NumPy documentation (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html) clearly states:
- **"Deprecated since version 2.3: Use `@typing.overload` or a `TypeVar` with a scalar-type as upper bound, instead."**
- This confirms that `NBitBase` is officially deprecated as of NumPy 2.3

### NumPy 2.3.0 Release Notes
The release notes explicitly document the deprecation:
- States that `numpy.typing.NBitBase` is being deprecated and will be removed in a future version
- Provides migration examples showing how to replace NBitBase usage with `@overload` decorators
- The deprecation is related to changes in how `float64` and `complex128` are treated as concrete subtypes

## Python Deprecation Warning Standards

According to Python's official documentation on warnings:
1. **DeprecationWarning** is the correct warning category for deprecated features
2. These warnings are intended for Python developers to notify about features that will be removed
3. By default, DeprecationWarning is ignored unless triggered from `__main__`
4. Best practice is that deprecated features should emit warnings when accessed/used

## Expected Behavior

Based on the documentation:
1. **The deprecation is official and documented** - NBitBase is deprecated as of NumPy 2.3
2. **A warning should be emitted** - The code includes a `__getattr__` implementation specifically designed to emit a DeprecationWarning
3. **The warning message is appropriate** - It matches what's documented in release notes
4. **Users should be notified** - The purpose of deprecation warnings is to give developers time to update their code

## Conclusion

The documentation clearly establishes that:
- NBitBase is officially deprecated
- A deprecation warning is the intended mechanism for notifying users
- The current implementation attempts to provide this warning but fails due to the import issue
- The bug prevents the documented deprecation behavior from working as intended
