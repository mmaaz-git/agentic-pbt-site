## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The `numpy.typing.__getattr__` function indeed crashes with a `NameError` when attempting to access `NBitBase` after it has been removed from the module's `__dict__`.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Created a test script that:
   - Imports `numpy.typing` as `npt`
   - Deletes `NBitBase` from `npt.__dict__` to force `__getattr__` to be called
   - Attempts to access `npt.NBitBase`

### Results
When running the reproduction code:
```python
import numpy.typing as npt
del npt.__dict__['NBitBase']
obj = npt.NBitBase
```

The following error occurred:
```
NameError: name 'NBitBase' is not defined
```

Additionally, a deprecation warning was issued:
```
DeprecationWarning: `NBitBase` is deprecated and will be removed from numpy.typing
in the future. Use `@typing.overload` or a `TypeVar` with a scalar-type as upper
bound, instead. (deprecated in NumPy 2.3)
```

### Code Analysis
Looking at `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/typing/__init__.py`:

Line 160: `from numpy._typing import ArrayLike, DTypeLike, NBitBase, NDArray`
- NBitBase is imported at the module level

Lines 173-184: The `__getattr__` function:
```python
def __getattr__(name: str):
    if name == "NBitBase":
        import warnings
        warnings.warn(...)
        return NBitBase  # Line 184: NameError occurs here
```

The issue is exactly as described: on line 184, the function attempts to return `NBitBase` directly, but this name is not available in the function's scope. The name `NBitBase` was imported at the module level (line 160), but within the `__getattr__` function, it's not accessible without explicitly referencing it from `globals()` or re-importing it.

### Conditions for Bug Manifestation
The bug report correctly notes this is currently "masked" in normal usage because:
1. NBitBase exists in the module's `__dict__` after import
2. `__getattr__` is only called when normal attribute lookup fails
3. Normal attribute lookup succeeds because NBitBase is in the module globals

The bug would manifest if:
- NBitBase were somehow removed from the module's `__dict__` (as in our test)
- The module were reloaded in certain ways
- Future changes removed NBitBase from the regular imports (as planned per the deprecation)
