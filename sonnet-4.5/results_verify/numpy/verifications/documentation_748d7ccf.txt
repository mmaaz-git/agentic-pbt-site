DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer

According to the official NumPy documentation (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.ctypeslib.html):

1. The ndpointer function signature is:
   numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer(dtype=None, ndim=None, shape=None, flags=None)

2. The flags parameter specification:
   - Type: str or tuple of str
   - Purpose: Specify array flags that must be satisfied
   - Valid values include: C_CONTIGUOUS/C/CONTIGUOUS, F_CONTIGUOUS/F/FORTRAN, OWNDATA/O, WRITEABLE/W, ALIGNED/A, WRITEBACKIFCOPY/X
   - Multiple flags can be combined using comma-separated strings

3. Error handling behavior mentioned in documentation:
   - "If a given array does not satisfy the specified restrictions, a TypeError is raised"
   - This statement refers to when arrays are passed to ctypes functions with ndpointer restrictions

4. What the documentation DOES NOT specify:
   - The documentation does not explicitly state what happens with invalid flag specifications during ndpointer creation
   - The documentation does not mention how empty strings in flag lists should be handled
   - The documentation does not specify whether KeyError or TypeError should be raised for invalid flag names
   - The documentation does not clarify the exact exception type for malformed flag inputs at ndpointer creation time

5. Important distinction:
   The documentation mentions TypeError for arrays that don't meet ndpointer requirements during runtime use, but doesn't specify the exception type for invalid flag specifications during ndpointer type creation itself.

The documentation is incomplete regarding error handling for malformed flag inputs during ndpointer creation.
