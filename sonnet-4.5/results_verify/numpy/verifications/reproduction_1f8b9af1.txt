REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION (from bug report):
   Code: printing.pprint_thing("hello world", escape_chars=['a'])
   Result: KeyError: 'a'
   Status: CONFIRMED - Raises KeyError as reported

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   The property-based test from the bug report was run with escape_chars containing ['\t', '\n', '\r', 'a', 'b', 'c'].
   Result: Failed immediately with KeyError: 'a' when escape_chars=['a']
   Status: CONFIRMED - Test fails as reported

3. ADDITIONAL TESTING PERFORMED:

   Test with standard escapes (list mode):
   - Input: "hello\tworld\n", escape_chars=['\t', '\n']
   - Result: 'hello\\tworld\\n' (successful escaping)
   - This works because '\t' and '\n' are in the hardcoded translate dict

   Test with custom characters (list mode):
   - Input: "hello world", escape_chars=['a']
   - Result: KeyError: 'a'
   - This fails because 'a' is not in the hardcoded translate dict

   Test with mixed valid/invalid (list mode):
   - Input: "hello\tworld", escape_chars=['\t', 'o']
   - Result: KeyError: 'o'
   - Fails on first non-standard character

   Test with dict mode:
   - Input: "hello world", escape_chars={'o': 'X', 'l': 'Y'}
   - Result: 'heYYX wXrYd' (successful replacement)
   - Dict mode works for ANY characters as advertised

4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   The bug occurs in the as_escaped_string internal function (lines 196-212):
   - Line 199 creates a hardcoded translate dict with only '\t', '\n', '\r'
   - Lines 210-211 iterate through escape_chars and do: result.replace(c, translate[c])
   - This raises KeyError for any character not in the hardcoded dict

5. BEHAVIOR INCONSISTENCY:
   - When escape_chars is a dict: ANY characters work (custom replacements)
   - When escape_chars is a list: ONLY '\t', '\n', '\r' work (hardcoded replacements)
   - This inconsistency is not documented

CONCLUSION:
The bug report is technically correct. The function crashes with KeyError when escape_chars is a list containing characters other than '\t', '\n', or '\r', despite the documentation suggesting that any list of characters should be acceptable.
