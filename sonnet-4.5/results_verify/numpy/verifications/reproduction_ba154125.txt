## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Hypothesis Test Results
The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report successfully identified the bug. When run with an input of `[()]` (a list containing a single empty tuple), the test fails with:
- Error: `IndexError: list index out of range`
- Location: `numpy/_core/records.py`, line 624 in `fromarrays`
- Cause: Attempting to access `arrayList[0].shape` when `arrayList` is empty

### Direct Reproduction Results
I tested multiple scenarios to confirm the bug:

1. **List of empty tuples `[(), (), ()]`**: FAILS with `IndexError: list index out of range`
   - Confirms the bug exists for multiple empty tuples

2. **Single empty tuple `[()]`**: FAILS with `IndexError: list index out of range`
   - Confirms the minimal failing case

3. **NumPy empty structured array `np.zeros(5, dtype=[])`**: SUCCEEDS
   - Creates a valid array with shape (5,) and empty dtype
   - This proves NumPy does support empty structured types

4. **Empty fromarrays `numpy.rec.fromarrays([])`**: FAILS with same error
   - Interestingly, this also fails with the same error, contradicting the bug report's claim
   - The bug is actually in the `fromarrays` function itself

### Key Findings
1. The bug is reproducible exactly as described in the report
2. The error occurs in `fromarrays` at line 624 when trying to access `arrayList[0].shape` on an empty list
3. NumPy does indeed support empty structured types (confirmed via `np.zeros(5, dtype=[])`)
4. The bug report's claim about `numpy.rec.fromarrays([])` working is incorrect - it also fails
5. The traceback and error message match exactly what was reported

### Conclusion
The bug is fully reproducible and the core issue is correctly identified: when `fromrecords` receives empty tuples, it passes an empty `arrayList` to `fromarrays`, which then tries to access the first element without checking if the list is non-empty.
