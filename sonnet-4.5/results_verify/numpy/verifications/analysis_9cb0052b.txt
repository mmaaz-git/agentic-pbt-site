## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG Classification
**Arguments for:**
- The parse method is documented as parsing "a Fortran expression" but fails to parse the Fortran power operator ** correctly by default
- The internal representation can generate 'x ** 2' but cannot parse it back, breaking a reasonable expectation
- The inconsistency between tostring() output and parse() input is problematic
- Users working with Fortran expressions would reasonably expect ** to work

**Arguments against:**
- The default language mode is C, where ** is not a valid operator
- The behavior is technically correct for C mode parsing
- The function works correctly when language=Language.Fortran is specified

### Considering INVALID Classification
**Arguments for:**
- The parser is working as designed - in C mode, ** is not a single operator
- The user can get correct behavior by specifying language=Language.Fortran
- C doesn't have a ** operator, so parsing it as * followed by * (dereference) is technically correct

**Arguments against:**
- The function claims to parse "Fortran expressions" in its documentation
- The code comments explicitly mention support for "exponentiation (**)"
- The tostring() method generates ** notation that the parser cannot handle in default mode

### Considering WONTFIX Classification
**Arguments for:**
- This might be considered an edge case of mixing language modes
- Users can work around by explicitly using Fortran language mode
- Changing default behavior could break existing code

**Arguments against:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - exponentiation is fundamental
- The issue affects basic mathematical expression parsing
- The round-trip property failure is a significant functional problem

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST Classification
**Arguments for:**
- Could be seen as requesting better C mode support for ** operator
- Asking for automatic language detection based on operators used

**Arguments against:**
- The code comments claim ** is already supported
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification
**Arguments for:**
- The main issue is the mismatch between documentation ("Parse a Fortran expression") and default behavior (C mode)
- Users would avoid the problem if documentation clearly stated language mode requirements
- The function technically works correctly for its actual design

**Arguments against:**
- Even with better documentation, the round-trip property failure is still a functional bug
- The tostring() method produces output that parse() cannot handle in the same mode

### Analysis Summary
The core issues are:
1. Documentation says "Parse a Fortran expression" but defaults to C mode
2. tostring() can output ** syntax that parse() cannot read in the same language mode
3. The round-trip property (parse(x.tostring()) == x) fails for valid inputs

The most significant problem is the internal inconsistency where the library generates expressions it cannot parse. This violates a fundamental principle of serialization/deserialization.
