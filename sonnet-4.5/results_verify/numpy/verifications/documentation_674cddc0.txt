## Documentation Review for NBitBase Deprecation

I reviewed the NumPy documentation and source code regarding NBitBase:

### Official Documentation (NumPy stable docs)
- NBitBase is officially documented as "Deprecated since version 2.3"
- The documentation clearly states that NBitBase should issue a deprecation warning when accessed
- It recommends using "@typing.overload or a TypeVar with a scalar-type as upper bound, instead"
- NBitBase represents number precision during static type checking

### Source Code Implementation (`numpy/typing/__init__.py`)
- Line 160: NBitBase is imported directly from numpy._typing: `from numpy._typing import ArrayLike, DTypeLike, NBitBase, NDArray`
- Line 162: NBitBase is included in __all__: `__all__ = ["ArrayLike", "DTypeLike", "NBitBase", "NDArray"]`
- Lines 173-184: __getattr__ contains code to issue a deprecation warning when NBitBase is accessed:
  - It checks if name == "NBitBase"
  - Issues a DeprecationWarning with stacklevel=2
  - Returns the NBitBase object

### Documentation Intent vs Implementation
The documentation's intent is clear:
1. NBitBase is deprecated and should warn users when accessed
2. The deprecation warning should inform users about alternatives
3. The warning should appear with NumPy 2.3+

The implementation attempts to achieve this through __getattr__, with a comment stating "Deprecated in NumPy 2.3, 2025-05-01". However, the implementation fails because NBitBase is directly imported into the module namespace, making the __getattr__ hook unreachable.

### Key Finding
There is no ambiguity in the documentation - NBitBase is meant to trigger a deprecation warning when accessed. The code explicitly tries to implement this warning mechanism in __getattr__, demonstrating clear intent that accessing NBitBase should produce a warning.
