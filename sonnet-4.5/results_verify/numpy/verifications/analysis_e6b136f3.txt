Triage Analysis
===============

Evaluating this bug report against the five possible categorizations:

1. INVALID (The bug report is incorrect):
   Why it might be INVALID:
   - None. The bug is real and reproducible.

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The test case clearly demonstrates different behavior between numpy and Python
   - The documentation explicitly claims to call str methods element-wise
   - The discrepancy is objectively verifiable

2. WONTFIX (Trivial and uninteresting):
   Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - Characters that expand during case conversion are relatively rare
   - Most ASCII-only text processing wouldn't encounter this issue
   - The fix might require significant internal restructuring of numpy's string handling

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - This affects proper internationalization and Unicode support
   - German language commonly uses ÃŸ, affecting millions of users
   - Data corruption (losing characters) is a serious issue
   - The documentation makes an explicit promise that isn't kept

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Requesting unsupported functionality):
   Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - numpy might never have intended to support expanding character conversions
   - The internal dtype system might not have been designed for variable-length results

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The documentation explicitly states it calls str methods element-wise
   - This isn't asking for new functionality, but for documented behavior to work
   - Python's str methods have always supported this since Python 3

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The easiest fix would be to update documentation to clarify the limitation
   - The documentation could add a warning about characters that expand
   - numpy's fixed-width dtype system might make the proper fix impractical

   Why it might NOT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation makes a clear promise about behavior
   - Changing documentation would be admitting a feature doesn't work as advertised
   - Users rely on the documented contract

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
   Why it IS a BUG:
   - The documentation explicitly promises to call str methods element-wise
   - The actual behavior differs from the documented behavior
   - Data is lost/corrupted (SS becomes S)
   - This is a contract violation, not undefined behavior
   - The functions produce incorrect results for valid Unicode input
   - No warnings or errors are raised when the truncation occurs

   Why it might NOT be a BUG:
   - If numpy has fundamental architectural limitations that were known but not documented

Final Assessment:
This is clearly a BUG. The documentation makes an unqualified claim that these functions call Python's str methods element-wise, but they demonstrably do not for certain valid inputs. The behavior difference is not a corner case or undefined behavior - it's a direct contradiction of the documented specification. While it could be reclassified as DOCUMENTATION_FIX if fixing the code is deemed impossible, the current state represents a bug in the implementation not matching its specification.
