Bug Reproduction Results
========================

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
The property-based test from the bug report FAILS as claimed:
- Test: Assert that compress_rows always returns 2D arrays
- Failure: When input is ma.array([[999]], mask=[[True]]), the result has ndim=1 with shape (0,)
- The test correctly identifies the dimensionality loss issue

2. MANUAL REPRODUCTION:

Test Case 1: Single masked element (1x1 array)
Input: ma.array([[999]], mask=[[True]])
- Input shape: (1, 1), ndim=2
- compress_rows result: shape=(0,), ndim=1
- compress_cols result: shape=(0,), ndim=1
- compress_rowcols result: shape=(0,), ndim=1
All three functions return 1D arrays instead of 2D when all data is masked.

Test Case 2: Fully masked 2x2 array
Input: ma.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], mask=[[True, True], [True, True]])
- Input shape: (2, 2), ndim=2
- compress_rows result: shape=(0,), ndim=1
- compress_cols result: shape=(0,), ndim=1
- compress_rowcols result: shape=(0,), ndim=1
Again, all return 1D arrays.

Test Case 3: Partially masked array (control case)
Input: ma.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], mask=[[True, False], [False, False]])
- compress_rows result: shape=(1, 2), ndim=2, content=[[3, 4]]
- compress_cols result: shape=(2, 1), ndim=2, content=[[2], [4]]
- compress_rowcols result: shape=(1, 1), ndim=2, content=[[4]]
When data remains, functions correctly return 2D arrays.

3. DOWNSTREAM IMPACT:
The bug report's claim about breaking downstream code is CONFIRMED:
```python
result = ma.compress_rows(arr)
num_cols = result.shape[1]
```
This raises IndexError: "tuple index out of range" when the result is 1D.

4. COMPARISON WITH NUMPY CONVENTIONS:
Standard numpy array slicing preserves dimensionality:
- Regular 2D array: shape (2, 2), ndim=2
- Empty slice of 2D array: shape (0, 2), ndim=2
This shows numpy's general convention is to preserve array dimensions even when empty.

5. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
In numpy/ma/extras.py, the compress_nd function at line 948:
```python
if m.all():
    return nxarray([])  # Returns np.array([]) - always 1D
```
This explicitly returns a 1D empty array regardless of input dimensions.

6. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
The bug report's technical details are CORRECT:
- The failing test case is valid
- The reproduction code works as described
- The behavior is inconsistent (2D when data remains, 1D when all masked)
- The proposed fix location (extras.py around line 948) is accurate
