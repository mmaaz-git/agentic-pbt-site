## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Result
The hypothesis test fails as expected with the error:
"Expected DeprecationWarning when accessing NBitBase"

This confirms that when accessing `numpy.typing.NBitBase`, no deprecation warning is triggered.

### Direct Reproduction
Running the reproduction code confirms:
- No deprecation warning is triggered when accessing `npt.NBitBase`
- The NBitBase class is accessible and returns `<class 'numpy.typing.NBitBase'>`

### Root Cause Analysis
By examining the numpy/typing/__init__.py file, I can confirm the exact cause described in the bug report:

1. Line 160: `from numpy._typing import ArrayLike, DTypeLike, NBitBase, NDArray`
   - NBitBase is directly imported into the module namespace

2. Line 162: `__all__ = ["ArrayLike", "DTypeLike", "NBitBase", "NDArray"]`
   - NBitBase is added to __all__, making it a public export

3. Lines 172-184: The __getattr__ function contains code to trigger a deprecation warning for NBitBase

The problem is that Python's attribute lookup mechanism finds `NBitBase` in the module's `__dict__` before ever calling `__getattr__`. This is confirmed by:
- `"NBitBase" in npt.__dict__` returns True
- Directly calling `npt.__getattr__("NBitBase")` DOES trigger the deprecation warning

This demonstrates that the deprecation mechanism is correctly implemented in `__getattr__`, but it's never reached during normal attribute access because NBitBase is already present in the module namespace.

### Impact
Users accessing the deprecated `NBitBase` attribute never see the intended deprecation warning, which defeats the purpose of gracefully deprecating this API. This is a clear bug in the deprecation mechanism implementation.
