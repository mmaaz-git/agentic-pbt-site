DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. numpy.strings.slice Documentation Analysis:

The function docstring explicitly states:
- "Slice the strings in `a` by slices specified by `start`, `stop`, `step`."
- "Like in the regular Python `slice` object, if only `start` is specified then it is interpreted as the `stop`."

Key documentation points:
- The function is explicitly documented to behave "Like in the regular Python `slice` object"
- Parameters start, stop, and step can be None, integers, or arrays of integers
- The documentation includes an example: np.strings.slice(b, None, None, -1) which demonstrates that None values should be supported

2. Python Slice Standard Behavior:

Python's built-in slice documentation and behavior establish that:
- slice(start, None) means "slice from start to the end of the sequence"
- None as a stop parameter means "go to the end"
- This is fundamental Python behavior, documented in the Python Language Reference

3. Comparison with Documentation:

The documentation clearly states the function should behave like Python's regular slice object. In Python:
- s[0:None] equals 'hello' (full string from index 0)
- s[1:None] equals 'ello' (from index 1 to end)
- s[2:None] equals 'llo' (from index 2 to end)

However, numpy.strings.slice produces:
- nps.slice(arr, 0, None) returns '' (empty string)
- nps.slice(arr, 1, None) returns 'h' (one character)
- nps.slice(arr, 2, None) returns 'he' (two characters)

4. Documentation Examples:

The documentation provides this example:
>>> np.strings.slice(b, None, None, -1)

This demonstrates that None values are intended to be supported and should follow Python's slice semantics.

5. Conclusion on Documentation:

The documentation explicitly states that numpy.strings.slice should behave "Like in the regular Python `slice` object". Python's slice object with stop=None means "slice to the end". The current implementation violates this documented behavior.

The function is not working according to its documented specification. This is NOT a case of unspecified behavior - the documentation is clear about the expected behavior matching Python's slice semantics.
