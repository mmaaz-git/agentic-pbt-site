## Documentation Analysis

### PEP 562 - Module __getattr__ Specification

Python's PEP 562 (implemented in Python 3.7) defines how module-level `__getattr__` should work:

1. **When Called**: `__getattr__` is called when an attribute is not found through normal module attribute lookup
2. **Scope Access**: The PEP examples show using `globals()` to access module-level names
3. **Expected Behavior**: Should either return a value or raise AttributeError

Example from PEP 562:
```python
def __getattr__(name):
    if name in deprecated_names:
        return globals()[f"_deprecated_{name}"]
    raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__!r} has no attribute {name!r}")
```

### NumPy Documentation

1. **numpy.typing Documentation**: No specific documentation found for the `__getattr__` implementation
2. **NBitBase Documentation**: Documented as deprecated since NumPy 2.3, with deprecation warnings expected
3. **Internal Implementation**: The `__getattr__` function appears to be an internal implementation detail for handling deprecated attributes

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected Behavior (per PEP 562)**:
- When `__getattr__` is called for a missing attribute, it should be able to handle the case gracefully
- Should use `globals()` to access module-level attributes, as shown in PEP examples
- Should work even if the attribute has been deleted from the module namespace

**Actual Behavior in NumPy**:
- Line 184 uses bare `NBitBase` reference instead of `globals()['NBitBase']`
- Line 187 correctly uses `globals()[name]` for other attributes
- Inconsistent pattern within the same function

### Conclusion

The bug violates PEP 562's expected pattern. While there's no explicit NumPy documentation requiring `__getattr__` to handle deleted attributes, the function should follow Python's standard module `__getattr__` behavior as defined in PEP 562. The inconsistency within the same function (using `globals()` in one branch but not the other) suggests this is an implementation oversight rather than intentional design.
