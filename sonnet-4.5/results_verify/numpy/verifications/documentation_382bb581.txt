## Documentation Analysis for numpy.random.geometric

### Official NumPy Documentation Findings

The NumPy documentation for `numpy.random.geometric()` provides the following information:

1. **Function Purpose**: Draws samples from the geometric distribution, which models the number of trials needed to achieve a single success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials.

2. **Mathematical Definition**: The probability mass function is f(k) = (1 - p)^(k - 1) * p, where k represents the number of trials and p is the probability of success.

3. **Parameter Description**:
   - `p`: Described as "float or array_like of floats" representing the "probability of success of an individual trial"
   - `size`: Optional parameter for output shape

4. **Return Values**:
   - Returns ndarray or scalar
   - Values represent "number of trials until first success"
   - The documentation states the distribution is "supported on positive integers: k = 1, 2, 3, ..."

5. **Critical Omissions**:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly specify the valid range for parameter p (i.e., 0 < p <= 1)
   - There is NO mention of behavior with extremely small p values
   - There is NO documentation about overflow behavior or limitations
   - There is NO mention of what happens when the expected value (1/p) exceeds int64 range
   - There are NO warnings about parameter constraints or edge cases

6. **Comparison with Generator API**:
   - The documentation recommends using `Generator.geometric()` for new code
   - The Generator.geometric() documentation is similarly lacking in edge case specifications

7. **Mathematical Context**:
   - The geometric distribution has expected value E[X] = 1/p
   - For very small p values, this expectation can exceed the range of int64
   - The documentation does not address this limitation

### Key Finding

The documentation does not specify what should happen when p is so small that the expected number of trials (1/p) exceeds the representable range of int64. This is a critical omission because:
- For p < 1e-18, the expected value exceeds int64 max (9.22e18)
- The function returns int64 values but doesn't document overflow behavior
- There are no warnings about practical parameter limits

The bug report's claim that the function "violates the fundamental contract of the geometric distribution" is based on the mathematical expectation that geometric distribution must return positive integers >= 1, which is stated in the documentation ("supported on positive integers: k = 1, 2, 3, ...").
