DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Official Documentation for numpy.strings.slice

The function signature is:
```
slice(a, start=None, stop=None, step=None, /)
```

### Key Documentation Points:

1. **Special Case Explicitly Documented**:
   The documentation states: "Like in the regular Python `slice` object, if only `start` is specified then it is interpreted as the `stop`."

2. **Parameter Descriptions**:
   - start: "None, an integer or an array of integers" - The start of the slice
   - stop: "None, an integer or an array of integers" - The end of the slice
   - step: "None, an integer or an array of integers" - The step for the slice

3. **Examples in Documentation**:
   - `np.strings.slice(a, 2)` returns `['he', 'wo']` - treating 2 as stop, not start
   - `np.strings.slice(b, None, None, -1)` shows that None can be used for parameters

## Analysis of Documentation vs. Bug Report

### The Core Issue:

The documentation describes a special case: "if only `start` is specified then it is interpreted as the `stop`."

However, the implementation appears to check if `stop is None` rather than checking if stop was actually provided as an argument. This creates an ambiguity:

1. When calling `slice(arr, 1)` - only start is specified, so 1 should be treated as stop âœ“
2. When calling `slice(arr, 1, None)` - BOTH start AND stop are specified, so this special case should NOT apply

### Python Slicing Behavior:

Regular Python slicing treats `None` as "no limit":
- `s[1:None]` equals `s[1:]` equals "slice from 1 to end"
- `s[None:2]` equals `s[:2]` equals "slice from start to 2"

### Documentation Interpretation:

The documentation says the function should behave "Like in the regular Python `slice` object". In Python:
- `slice(1)` creates a slice object with stop=1
- `slice(1, None)` creates a slice object with start=1, stop=None (meaning to end)

These are fundamentally different behaviors, and Python's slice() correctly distinguishes them.

### Conclusion:

The documentation clearly states the function should behave like Python's slice object. Python's slice object DOES distinguish between:
- Only providing one argument (treated as stop)
- Providing two arguments where the second is None (treated as start=first, stop=end)

The current numpy.strings.slice implementation violates this documented behavior by treating `slice(arr, 1, None)` the same as `slice(arr, 1)`, which is incorrect according to both:
1. The stated goal of behaving "Like in the regular Python `slice` object"
2. User expectations based on Python's standard slicing semantics

The bug report correctly identifies this as a violation of the documented behavior.
