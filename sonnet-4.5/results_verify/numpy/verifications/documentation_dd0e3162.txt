DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS
======================

NUMPY.POLYNOMIAL.POLYMUL DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------------------------

The official documentation for numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polymul states:
- Function multiplies two polynomials represented as coefficient arrays
- Coefficients are ordered from lowest to highest order term
- Returns a NumPy array of coefficients representing the product polynomial
- Example: polymul([1,2,3], [3,2,1]) returns [3, 8, 14, 8, 3]

CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS:
----------------------

1. NO ASSOCIATIVITY GUARANTEE:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly guarantee associativity
   - No mention of mathematical properties that must be preserved
   - No warnings about potential violations of algebraic properties

2. NO FLOATING-POINT PRECISION DISCUSSION:
   - Documentation does not address floating-point precision issues
   - No mention of denormal/subnormal number handling
   - No warnings about edge cases with extremely small values
   - No discussion of IEEE 754 compliance or limitations

3. POLYNOMIAL TRIMMING BEHAVIOR:
   - Documentation for polytrim function confirms it removes "small" trailing coefficients
   - Default tolerance is zero (removes exact zeros)
   - This trimming is applied after polynomial operations
   - Documentation does not warn about trimming affecting associativity

4. GENERAL NUMPY POLYNOMIAL DOCUMENTATION:
   - Focuses on API usage and migration from legacy poly1d
   - Does not provide mathematical guarantees or precision warnings
   - No discussion of numerical stability considerations

DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
-------------------

The documentation lacks:
1. Warning about non-associativity with denormal numbers
2. Discussion of floating-point underflow behavior
3. Explanation of when/how polynomial trimming affects results
4. Mathematical properties that are/aren't guaranteed

CONCLUSION:
-----------

The polymul function documentation does not specify that associativity must be preserved,
nor does it warn users that associativity may be violated in edge cases. This is a
documentation gap - users would reasonably expect polynomial multiplication to be
associative (as it is mathematically), but the implementation doesn't guarantee this
for all floating-point inputs due to the interaction between underflow and polynomial
trimming.
