## Bug Reproduction Results

### Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis test confirms the bug. Running the test with negative ndim values (from -1000 to -1) shows that `numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer` accepts negative values without raising any exception. The test fails with the assertion error "Should reject negative ndim -1", confirming that the function does not validate negative ndim values.

### Direct Reproduction
The reproduction code confirms the exact behavior described in the bug report:

1. `numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer(ndim=-1)` successfully creates a pointer class without raising any exception
2. The created class has the name 'ndpointer_any_-1d' showing it accepts the negative value
3. The internal `_ndim_` attribute is set to -1
4. When attempting to use this pointer with an actual array via `from_param()`, it raises a TypeError with the confusing message "array must have -1 dimension(s)"

Testing with other negative values (e.g., -10) shows the same behavior - the pointer is created successfully but produces nonsensical error messages like "array must have -10 dimension(s)".

### Key Findings
1. The bug report is accurate - negative ndim values are accepted without validation
2. The error only manifests when trying to use the pointer, not at creation time
3. The error messages produced are confusing because they reference impossible negative dimensions
4. This is a clear case of missing input validation - negative dimensions are semantically invalid for arrays

The bug violates the principle of early validation. Invalid inputs should be rejected when the pointer type is created, not later during array validation.
