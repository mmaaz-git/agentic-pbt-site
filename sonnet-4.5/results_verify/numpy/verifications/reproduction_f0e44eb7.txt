## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the behavior described in the bug report. The key findings are:

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The provided hypothesis test does identify a discrepancy, but the actual issue is more fundamental than the bug report suggests.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: Running the exact code from the bug report produces the reported output:
   ```
   not_equal      : Python=True, NumPy=False
   less           : Python=True, NumPy=False
   greater_equal  : Python=False, NumPy=True
   ```

3. **Root Cause Identified**: The issue is NOT in the comparison functions themselves, but in NumPy's fundamental string handling. NumPy's `np.str_` type **intentionally strips trailing null characters**.

### Evidence

When creating NumPy arrays with strings containing trailing nulls:
- `'a'` becomes `np.str_('a')`
- `'a\x00'` also becomes `np.str_('a')` (null is stripped)
- The arrays `np.array(['a'])` and `np.array(['a\x00'])` contain identical values

This means the comparison operators are working correctly - they are comparing two identical strings ('a' == 'a'), which explains why:
- `not_equal` returns False (they ARE equal after null stripping)
- `less` returns False (they ARE equal after null stripping)
- `greater_equal` returns True (they ARE equal after null stripping)

### Additional Testing

I verified that:
1. Trailing nulls are stripped: `'a\x00'` → `'a'`
2. Multiple trailing nulls are stripped: `'a\x00\x00'` → `'a'`
3. Non-trailing nulls are preserved: `'a\x00b'` → `'a\x00b'`
4. Leading nulls are preserved: `'\x00a'` → `'\x00a'`

This behavior is consistent and affects all string comparison operations, not just the three mentioned in the bug report.
