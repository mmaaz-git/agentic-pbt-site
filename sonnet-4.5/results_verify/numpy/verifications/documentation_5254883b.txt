## Documentation Analysis for numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer

### Official Documentation Review

I have reviewed both the inline documentation (docstring) and the online NumPy documentation for `numpy.ctypeslib.ndpointer`. Here are the key findings:

#### Parameter Documentation
The documentation clearly states that the `shape` parameter should be:
- **Type**: "tuple of ints, optional"
- **Description**: "Array shape"

This is explicitly documented in:
1. The function's docstring (accessed via help())
2. The official NumPy documentation (numpy.org/doc/stable)

#### Key Documentation Points

1. **Explicit Type Requirement**: The documentation unambiguously states "tuple of ints" for the shape parameter. This means:
   - The shape should be a tuple
   - The elements of the tuple should be integers
   - Strings, dictionaries, sets, or tuples containing non-integers are NOT mentioned as valid inputs

2. **Purpose of the Parameter**: The documentation explains that shape is used to verify array dimensions when calling ctypes functions, and that a TypeError should be raised if the array doesn't satisfy the restrictions.

3. **Source Code vs Documentation**: The actual implementation (lines 314-319 of _ctypeslib.py) shows:
   ```python
   if shape is not None:
       try:
           shape = tuple(shape)
       except TypeError:
           # single integer -> 1-tuple
           shape = (shape,)
   ```
   This implementation blindly converts any iterable to a tuple without validating that the elements are integers.

### Documentation Contract Violation

The current implementation violates the documented API contract in several ways:

1. **Accepts non-tuple iterables**: While the docs say "tuple of ints", the code accepts strings, dicts, sets, and any iterable
2. **No integer validation**: The code doesn't check if tuple elements are integers, allowing strings like 'a', 'b', 'c' as shape dimensions
3. **Misleading behavior**: String "100" becomes shape ('1', '0', '0') instead of being rejected or interpreted as integer 100

### Conclusion

The documentation is clear and unambiguous: the shape parameter should be "tuple of ints". The current implementation fails to enforce this documented constraint, making this a legitimate bug where the code doesn't match its documented behavior. Users following the documentation would reasonably expect type validation that prevents nonsensical shapes like ('a', 'b', 'c').
