## Documentation Analysis

### numpy.char.title Documentation

The official NumPy documentation states:
- numpy.char.title "Returns element-wise title cased version of string or unicode"
- It "Calls str.title() element-wise"
- For 8-bit strings, it's locale-dependent

Critically, the documentation **does not mention**:
- Any truncation behavior when Unicode case conversion expands character count
- Any limitations with Unicode ligatures or characters that expand during case conversion
- That results may differ from Python's str.title() due to dtype constraints

### NumPy String dtype Behavior

From the NumPy types documentation:
- NumPy uses fixed-width string arrays (U<n> notation)
- When strings exceed allocated dtype size, they are **truncated**
- This is documented general behavior for string arrays

### Comparison with Other numpy.char Functions

Testing reveals inconsistent behavior:
- `char.add()` properly expands dtype when concatenating (U4 + U3 = U7)
- `char.multiply()` properly expands dtype when repeating strings
- `char.upper()` and `char.title()` do NOT expand dtype, leading to truncation

### Key Finding

The documentation claims numpy.char.title "calls str.title() element-wise" but this is **misleading**. While it does apply the title case transformation, it does not produce identical results to str.title() when Unicode expansion occurs. The function truncates results to match the input dtype size, which is not mentioned in the documentation.

### Expected Behavior Based on Documentation

Users would reasonably expect:
1. Results identical to Python's str.title() (as documented)
2. Either automatic dtype expansion (like char.add) or at least a warning about truncation
3. Consistency with how other numpy.char functions handle string expansion

The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise and the documented claim of calling "str.title() element-wise".
