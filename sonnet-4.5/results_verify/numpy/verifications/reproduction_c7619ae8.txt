Bug Reproduction Report for numpy.f2py.capi_maps

REPRODUCTION RESULTS:

1. PROPERTY-BASED TEST EXECUTION:
   The test correctly identifies the issue:
   - float → NPY_FLOAT matches complex_float → NPY_CFLOAT (FLOAT == FLOAT) ✓
   - double → NPY_DOUBLE matches complex_double → NPY_CDOUBLE (DOUBLE == DOUBLE) ✓
   - long_double → NPY_LONGDOUBLE DOES NOT match complex_long_double → NPY_CDOUBLE (LONGDOUBLE != DOUBLE) ✗

   Test fails with: "Precision mismatch: long_double -> NPY_LONGDOUBLE, but complex_long_double -> NPY_CDOUBLE"

2. DIRECT INSPECTION:
   Current mapping in numpy/f2py/capi_maps.py line 73:
   - complex_long_double maps to NPY_CDOUBLE
   - This breaks the consistent pattern where complex types preserve the precision of their base type

3. INCONSISTENCY VERIFICATION:
   - c2capi_map['complex_long_double'] = 'NPY_CDOUBLE' (line 73)
   - c2pycode_map['complex_long_double'] = 'G' (line 93)
   - 'G' corresponds to NPY_CLONGDOUBLE according to NumPy headers
   - This internal inconsistency suggests an error in c2capi_map

4. IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
   The bug is real and would cause:
   - Silent precision loss when F2PY wraps Fortran code using complex*16 or complex(kind=16) types
   - Inconsistent behavior between the C API mapping and Python type code mapping
   - Violation of the principle that complex types should preserve base type precision

5. TECHNICAL VALIDITY:
   - NPY_CLONGDOUBLE exists and is defined in NumPy headers
   - The suggested fix (changing NPY_CDOUBLE to NPY_CLONGDOUBLE) is technically valid
   - The pattern analysis strongly supports this change

CONCLUSION:
The bug report is technically accurate. The test correctly identifies that complex_long_double incorrectly maps to NPY_CDOUBLE instead of NPY_CLONGDOUBLE, causing a precision mismatch that breaks the consistent pattern observed in other type mappings.
