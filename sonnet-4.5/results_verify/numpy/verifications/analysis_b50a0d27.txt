## Bug Report Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Strong evidence this is a valid bug:**
- The numpy.char functions produce objectively incorrect results that violate their documented behavior
- The documentation states these functions are "based on" Python's string methods, establishing a clear behavioral contract
- Multiple functions are affected in a systematic way, showing a fundamental implementation issue
- The bug produces completely wrong results (not just edge cases):
  - find() returns 0 instead of -1 for non-existent substrings
  - count() returns 6 for a string with 0 null bytes
  - startswith/endswith return True when they should return False
- The control tests show the functions work correctly for non-null-byte cases
- This affects basic string operations that developers would reasonably expect to work

### Consideration for INVALID
**Reasons it might be invalid:**
- None identified. The documentation clearly establishes expected behavior, and the implementation violates it.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Reasons it might be WONTFIX:**
- The numpy.char module is marked as "legacy" and will "no longer receive updates"
- However, the bug is severe enough that it makes the functions unusable for any data containing null bytes
- The functions produce completely incorrect results, not just minor edge cases
- This is not an obscure edge case - null bytes are valid Unicode characters

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Reasons it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could argue the documentation should explicitly state null bytes are not supported
- However, the documentation says these are "based on" Python methods, which do support null bytes
- Changing documentation to say "doesn't work with null bytes" would be acknowledging a major limitation

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Reasons it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue null byte support is a "new feature" not originally intended
- However, Python strings inherently support null bytes, and numpy claims to provide Python-like string operations
- This is not adding new functionality but fixing broken existing functionality

### Severity Assessment
This is a HIGH severity bug because:
1. It produces completely incorrect results (not just slightly wrong)
2. It affects multiple core string functions
3. It violates the documented behavior
4. There's no workaround within numpy.char
5. It could cause silent data corruption in applications

### Conclusion
This is unequivocally a BUG. The functions fail to perform their documented purpose when given valid input (strings containing null bytes). The failure is systematic, severe, and violates the clear expectation set by the documentation that these functions behave like Python's string methods. While the module is legacy, the bug is severe enough that it warrants fixing rather than being dismissed as WONTFIX.
