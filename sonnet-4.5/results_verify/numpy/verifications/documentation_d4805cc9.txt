DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

NUMPY.STRINGS.INDEX DOCUMENTATION:
-----------------------------------
The documentation states:
"Like `find`, but raises :exc:`ValueError` when the substring is not found."

Returns:
- out : ndarray - Output array of ints

Key observations:
1. The documentation says it returns an "Output array of ints" - this implies it should return an array, not raise an exception for the entire operation
2. It says it's "Like `find`" - this creates an expectation of similar behavior, just with different error handling
3. The phrase "when the substring is not found" is ambiguous in a vectorized context - does it mean:
   - When the substring is not found in ANY element? (current behavior)
   - When the substring is not found in ALL elements?
   - When the substring is not found in a specific element?

NUMPY.STRINGS.FIND DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------------------
The documentation states:
"For each element, return the lowest index in the string where substring `sub` is found"

Returns:
- y : ndarray - Output array of ints

The rfind documentation includes an example showing mixed results:
```
>>> b = np.array(["Computer Science", "Science"])
>>> np.strings.rfind(b, "Science", start=0, end=None)
array([9, 0])
```

This demonstrates that find/rfind are designed to work element-wise and return results for each element independently.

PYTHON STR.INDEX BEHAVIOR:
--------------------------
Python's str.index() documentation states:
"Raises ValueError when the substring is not found."

For a single string, this is unambiguous - if the substring isn't found, raise ValueError.

VECTORIZATION CONTEXT:
----------------------
NumPy functions are generally expected to operate element-wise on arrays. The documentation for index() says it returns an "ndarray" which suggests it should handle arrays properly. However, the current implementation raises ValueError for the entire array if any single element doesn't contain the substring.

DOCUMENTATION AMBIGUITY:
------------------------
The core issue is that the documentation doesn't clearly specify the behavior for arrays with mixed results. The phrase "raises ValueError when the substring is not found" doesn't clarify:
1. Whether this applies to individual elements or the entire array
2. How to handle arrays where some elements contain the substring and others don't
3. Whether the function is intended for vectorized operations or only for cases where all elements contain the substring

COMPARISON WITH LEGACY numpy.char:
-----------------------------------
The numpy.char module is marked as legacy and recommends using numpy.strings instead. However, the documentation doesn't provide clear guidance on how numpy.strings.index should behave differently from standard Python string methods in a vectorized context.

CONCLUSION:
-----------
The documentation is ambiguous about the expected behavior for arrays with mixed results. While it states the function returns an "Output array of ints", it also says it raises ValueError when the substring is not found, without clarifying how this applies to vectorized operations. This ambiguity is at the heart of the reported issue.
