## Bug Report Analysis

### Category Considerations

#### BUG (Valid Bug) - **LIKELY**
**Supporting Evidence:**
- The inconsistency between the three mapping dictionaries is real and reproducible
- Code crashes with KeyError when processing unsigned_long or unsigned_long_long types
- The parallel structure of the three maps strongly suggests they should have matching keys
- Other unsigned types (unsigned_char, unsigned_short, unsigned) ARE present in c2py_map, so the omission of unsigned_long and unsigned_long_long appears unintentional
- The suggested fix (mapping to 'long') is consistent with how signed long_long is handled
- Real-world impact: Any f2py wrapper generation for Fortran code using these types will fail

**Against:**
- No explicit documentation requiring consistency between the maps

#### INVALID - **UNLIKELY**
**Supporting Evidence:**
- Could argue that undocumented internal implementation details aren't bugs
- Perhaps unsigned_long/unsigned_long_long were intentionally omitted

**Against:**
- The code actively uses these maps together and expects consistency
- KeyError crashes are clearly not intended behavior
- Other unsigned types ARE included, making selective omission illogical

#### WONTFIX - **UNLIKELY**
**Supporting Evidence:**
- Could be considered an obscure edge case if unsigned_long_long is rarely used

**Against:**
- unsigned_long and unsigned_long_long are standard C types
- f2py is meant to be a general Fortran-to-Python wrapper generator
- The fix is trivial (just add two dictionary entries)
- Not fixing means f2py cannot handle legitimate Fortran code

#### FEATURE_REQUEST - **UNLIKELY**
**Supporting Evidence:**
- Could frame as "add support for unsigned_long_long"

**Against:**
- The infrastructure already exists (entries in c2capi_map and c2pycode_map)
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities
- The types are already partially supported, just inconsistently

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - **UNLIKELY**
**Supporting Evidence:**
- Could document that unsigned_long_long isn't supported

**Against:**
- The code structure indicates these types SHOULD be supported
- Documenting limitations is inferior to fixing a simple omission
- Other parts of the code already handle these types

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The three mapping dictionaries are designed to work in concert, providing different aspects of C type information. The presence of unsigned_long and unsigned_long_long in two maps but not the third is an inconsistency that causes actual failures. The fix is straightforward and consistent with how other types are handled.
