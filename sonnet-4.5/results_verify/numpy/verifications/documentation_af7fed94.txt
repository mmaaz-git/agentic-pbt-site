## Documentation Analysis

### NumPy Documentation Review:

1. **Limited Documentation**: The official NumPy documentation for `numpy.strings.add` and `numpy.char.add` does not explicitly specify how null characters (\x00) should be handled during string concatenation.

2. **Function Purpose**: The documentation states that `numpy.strings.add` performs element-wise addition/concatenation of strings, supporting array broadcasting. It's described as equivalent to the `+` operator for NumPy arrays.

3. **No Special Character Handling Mentioned**: The documentation does not mention any special handling, stripping, or transformation of null characters or other special characters during concatenation.

4. **Legacy Status**: The numpy.char module is marked as "legacy" with a recommendation to use numpy.strings instead, though both exhibit the same null-handling issue.

### Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:

Since the documentation states that `numpy.strings.add` is equivalent to the `+` operator and provides element-wise string concatenation, users would reasonably expect:

1. **Consistency with Python**: String concatenation should behave like Python's native string concatenation, which preserves all characters including nulls.

2. **No Data Loss**: Without explicit documentation stating that certain characters will be stripped or transformed, users expect all input data to be preserved.

3. **Mathematical Properties**: String concatenation should maintain standard properties like:
   - Length preservation: len(a + b) == len(a) + len(b)
   - Character preservation: All characters from both inputs should appear in the output

### Python's Behavior (Reference Standard):

Testing confirms that Python's native string concatenation:
- Preserves all null characters regardless of position
- Maintains exact string lengths
- Does not strip or transform any characters

### Documentation Gap:

The NumPy documentation fails to warn users that:
- Null characters at string boundaries are stripped
- This behavior differs from Python's standard string concatenation
- Data loss can occur when working with strings containing null bytes

### Conclusion:

The lack of documentation about null character handling, combined with the stated equivalence to Python's `+` operator, creates a reasonable expectation that numpy.strings.add should preserve all characters. The actual behavior (stripping edge nulls) contradicts this expectation and constitutes undocumented data loss.
