REPRODUCTION FINDINGS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report.

1. Property-Based Test Results:
   - The test with negative shape dimensions PASSES when it should fail
   - ndpointer(shape=(-1, 3)) creates successfully without validation
   - ndpointer(shape=(0, -1)) creates successfully without validation
   - ndpointer(shape=(-5, 10)) creates successfully without validation
   - All these cases should have raised ValueError or TypeError

2. Manual Example Results:
   - Created ndpointer with shape=(-1, 3) successfully
   - The pointer class name is 'ndpointer_any_-1x3'
   - The _shape_ attribute is correctly set to (-1, 3)
   - When attempting to use this pointer with valid NumPy arrays:
     * np.zeros((2, 3)) fails with "array must have shape (-1, 3)"
     * np.zeros((1, 3)) fails with "array must have shape (-1, 3)"
     * np.zeros((3, 3)) fails with "array must have shape (-1, 3)"
   - The error message is nonsensical since no NumPy array can have shape (-1, 3)

3. Additional Findings:
   - NumPy itself does NOT allow negative dimensions in array creation:
     * np.zeros((-1, 3)) raises ValueError: "negative dimensions are not allowed"
   - The -1 value in reshape has special meaning (infer dimension) but this is different
   - ndpointer also allows negative ndim values (e.g., ndim=-1) without validation
   - Zero dimensions ARE valid (shape=(0, 5) works correctly with np.zeros((0, 5)))

4. Core Issue:
   The ndpointer function accepts negative shape values at creation time but these values
   are meaningless and impossible to satisfy. This leads to confusing error messages when
   the pointer is actually used, as it asks for arrays with impossible shapes.

The bug report is accurate in its description and reproduction steps.
