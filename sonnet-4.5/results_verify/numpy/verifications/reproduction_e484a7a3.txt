REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

The bug report is accurate and reproducible. I have confirmed the following:

1. The Hypothesis test fails as described:
   - When test_slice_with_none_stop(['hello']) is run, it fails with:
     AssertionError: slice(arr, 0, None) failed: got '', expected 'hello'
   - This confirms that nps.slice(arr, 0, None) returns an empty string instead of the full string.

2. Direct reproduction confirms the bug:
   - nps.slice(['hello', 'world', 'test'], 1, None) returns ['h', 'w', 't']
   - Expected result should be ['ello', 'orld', 'est'] (slicing from index 1 to end)
   - The function is incorrectly treating the start parameter (1) as the stop parameter

3. Pattern of incorrect behavior:
   - nps.slice(arr, 0, None) returns empty strings (takes first 0 characters)
   - nps.slice(arr, 1, None) returns first character only (takes first 1 character)
   - nps.slice(arr, 2, None) returns first 2 characters (takes first 2 characters)

   In all cases, when stop=None is explicitly passed, the function treats start as stop.

4. Comparison with Python slicing:
   - Python's arr[0][1:None] correctly returns 'ello'
   - numpy.strings.slice with (arr, 1, None) incorrectly returns 'h'

5. The bug occurs consistently:
   - nps.slice(arr, 1) (without explicit None) has the same incorrect behavior
   - This suggests the function cannot distinguish between "stop not provided" and "stop=None"

The bug is real and affects the core functionality of the slice() function when None is used as the stop parameter, which should mean "slice to the end" according to Python slicing conventions.
