## Reproduction of Bug Report

### Bug Confirmation
The bug report is accurate. I have successfully reproduced the reported behavior.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The property-based test from the bug report fails immediately on the example input "'" (single apostrophe)
   - Error: AssertionError raised from line 1195 in numpy/f2py/symbolic.py

2. **Direct Reproduction**:
   - `symbolic.eliminate_quotes("'")` raises AssertionError as reported
   - The same error occurs with other unmatched quotes:
     - Single unmatched double quote: '"'
     - Unmatched quotes at beginning: "'test", '"test'
     - Unmatched quotes at end: 'test"', "test'"
     - Mixed unmatched quotes: '"test\'', '\'test"'

3. **Normal Behavior**:
   - The function works correctly with properly quoted strings
   - Examples that work:
     - "'hello'" → replaces with placeholder, stores in dictionary
     - '"world"' → same behavior for double quotes
     - "text 'with quotes' inside" → only replaces the quoted portions
   - Round-trip with insert_quotes() works perfectly for valid inputs

### Technical Details

The function uses regex patterns to match complete quoted strings:
- Single quotes: `r"('([^'\\]|(\\.))*')"`
- Double quotes: `r"("([^"\\]|(\\.))*")"`

These patterns only match complete, properly quoted strings. Any unmatched quote character remains in the output string `new_s`, triggering the assertions:
```python
assert '"' not in new_s
assert "'" not in new_s
```

### Effect

The bug causes the function to crash with AssertionError when processing strings containing unmatched quote characters. This prevents the function from handling arbitrary string inputs and breaks the documented inverse relationship with insert_quotes() for these cases.
