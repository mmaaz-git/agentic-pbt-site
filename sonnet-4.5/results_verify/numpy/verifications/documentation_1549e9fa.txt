DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR pandas.core.strings.accessor.cat_core

Function Documentation:
- The cat_core function is documented as an "Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`"
- It accepts two parameters:
  1. list_of_columns: list of numpy arrays (arrays may not contain NaNs)
  2. sep: string - The separator string for concatenating the columns
- Returns: nd.array - The concatenation of list_of_columns with sep

Key Documentation Points:
1. The 'sep' parameter is simply documented as "string" with no restrictions mentioned
2. No documentation indicates that null bytes (\x00) should not be supported
3. No documentation warns about special character limitations
4. The function is internal (auxiliary) but is exposed in the public namespace

pandas.Series.str.cat Documentation:
- The public-facing str.cat() method documentation shows no restrictions on separator characters
- Examples show space and comma separators, but no explicit list of allowed/disallowed characters
- No mention of null byte handling or restrictions

NumPy Documentation:
- numpy.sum documentation doesn't specifically address string concatenation behavior
- No documented warnings about mixing array types with string scalars containing null bytes
- The behavior with object arrays containing strings is not explicitly documented

Documentation Gap:
There is NO documentation that indicates null bytes should be treated differently or dropped. The separator parameter is documented as accepting any string, which in Python includes strings containing null bytes. The silent dropping of null bytes is therefore undocumented behavior that violates the principle of least surprise.
