BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS FOR NBITBASE DEPRECATION
=============================================

Evaluating Each Possible Category:
-----------------------------------

1. INVALID (Not a bug - incorrect report)
   Why it might be INVALID:
   - None - the bug is real and reproducible

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The code clearly intends to emit a deprecation warning (lines 172-184)
   - The documentation states NBitBase is deprecated since 2.3
   - The warning mechanism exists but doesn't work due to Python's attribute lookup
   - The test case correctly identifies the problem

   Verdict: NOT INVALID

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - NBitBase still works functionally (users can access it)
   - Only the warning is missing, not the functionality

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - Deprecation warnings are critical for user migration paths
   - NumPy has a documented removal timeline (2025-05-01)
   - Silent breaking changes violate semantic versioning principles
   - This affects all users of NBitBase who need to migrate their code
   - The fix is simple and non-breaking

   Verdict: NOT WONTFIX

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
   Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - None - deprecation warnings are already implemented

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The deprecation warning is already coded and intended to work
   - This is fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new features
   - The __getattr__ mechanism already exists but isn't triggered

   Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - Could argue the docs should say "NBitBase will be removed" without warning

   Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code explicitly implements the warning mechanism
   - The intent is clear from comments: "# Deprecated in NumPy 2.3"
   - The __getattr__ function exists specifically to emit this warning
   - The problem is a Python mechanics issue, not wrong documentation

   Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Why it IS a BUG:
   - Clear intent: Code exists to emit deprecation warning
   - Broken mechanism: Python attribute lookup bypasses __getattr__
   - User impact: No migration warning for deprecated API
   - Contract violation: Documentation promises deprecation, code attempts it
   - Simple fix: Import as _NBitBase to trigger __getattr__
   - Regression risk: None - fix maintains all functionality
   - Severity: Medium - affects API migration but not functionality

   Why it might NOT be a BUG:
   - None - all evidence points to this being a legitimate bug

   Verdict: IS A BUG

Additional Considerations:
--------------------------
- The bug reporter provides a working fix
- The fix is minimal and follows Python best practices
- This type of __getattr__ deprecation pattern is common
- The bug defeats NumPy's deprecation policy
- Users relying on deprecation warnings for CI/CD will miss this

Final Assessment:
-----------------
This is a clear BUG where the implementation fails to achieve its documented
and intended behavior. The deprecation warning mechanism exists but is
bypassed due to a simple import issue. The fix is straightforward and
maintains backward compatibility while properly warning users.
