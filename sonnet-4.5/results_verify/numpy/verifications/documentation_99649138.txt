## Documentation Analysis

### numpy.ma.mask_or Documentation
The function's docstring clearly states:
```
Parameters
----------
m1, m2 : array_like
    Input masks.
```

The function explicitly documents that it accepts "array_like" inputs for both m1 and m2 parameters.

### NumPy's array_like Convention
According to NumPy's official glossary (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/glossary.html):
- "array_like" refers to "Any scalar or sequence that can be interpreted as an ndarray"
- This includes: lists (possibly nested), tuples, scalars, and ndarrays
- The definition states: "Any argument accepted by numpy.array is array_like"

### Consistency Check with Other NumPy Functions

1. **Other mask functions in numpy.ma**:
   - `make_mask`: Accepts array_like and correctly handles lists. Test: `ma.make_mask([True, False, True])` works correctly.
   - `getmask`: Accepts array_like and correctly handles lists. Test: `ma.getmask([1, 2, 3])` works correctly.

2. **Core NumPy functions**:
   - `np.logical_or`: Accepts lists as array_like inputs and works correctly
   - `np.add`: Accepts lists as array_like inputs and works correctly
   - `np.array` and `np.asarray`: By definition, accept array_like inputs including lists

### Documentation vs Implementation Gap
There is a clear mismatch between:
1. **What the documentation promises**: The function should accept array_like inputs (including lists)
2. **What the implementation delivers**: The function crashes with AttributeError when given lists

### Conclusion
The documentation explicitly states that `mask_or` accepts array_like inputs, which by NumPy's own definition includes Python lists. The implementation fails to honor this documented contract. This is not a case of unspecified behavior - the documentation is clear and explicit about accepting array_like inputs. The function's failure to handle lists is a violation of its documented interface.
