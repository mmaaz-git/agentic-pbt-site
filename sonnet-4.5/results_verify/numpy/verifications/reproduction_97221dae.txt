REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

The bug report is confirmed to be reproducible. I ran both the Hypothesis test and the simple test case provided in the bug report.

1. Hypothesis Test Result:
   - The test with s='hello' and start=0 fails as reported
   - Expected: 'hello' (from s[0:None])
   - Got: '' (empty string from nps.slice(arr, 0, None))
   - AssertionError is raised as expected

2. Simple Test Case Result:
   - The simple example also reproduces the issue
   - Expected: 'hello' (from s[0:None])
   - Got: np.str_('') (empty string from nps.slice(arr, 0, None))
   - AssertionError is raised as expected

3. Extended Testing Results:
   I performed additional tests to understand the behavior pattern:

   With concrete integer values (working correctly):
   - nps.slice(arr, 0, 5) returns 'hello' ✓
   - nps.slice(arr, 1, 4) returns 'ell' ✓

   With None as stop parameter (incorrect behavior):
   - nps.slice(arr, 0, None) returns '' (expected 'hello') ✗
   - nps.slice(arr, 1, None) returns 'h' (expected 'ello') ✗
   - nps.slice(arr, 2, None) returns 'he' (expected 'llo') ✗
   - nps.slice(arr, None, 3) returns 'hel' ✓
   - nps.slice(arr, None, None) returns 'hello' ✓

   The pattern shows that when stop=None with an explicit start value, the function returns start characters from the beginning instead of all characters from start to the end.

4. Comparison with Python's Standard Slice:
   Python's standard slice behavior with None:
   - s[0:None] = 'hello'
   - s[1:None] = 'ello'
   - s[2:None] = 'llo'
   - slice(0, None) behaves identically to s[0:]

   numpy.strings.slice deviates significantly from this expected behavior.

CONCLUSION: The bug is reproducible and behaves exactly as described in the report.
