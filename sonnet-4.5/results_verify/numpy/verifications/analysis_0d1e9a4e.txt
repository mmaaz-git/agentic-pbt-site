## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function's docstring does not specify what valid values for `count` are, nor does it explicitly state that negative counts are prohibited. The function is in django.utils, which is an internal utility module not part of Django's public API. Since there's no documented contract about how negative values should be handled, the current behavior (using Python's standard list slicing semantics) could be considered acceptable. The function technically does return a string of words - just not the number specified when using negative indices, which follows Python's slicing conventions.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The docstring clearly states "Return a string of `count` lorem ipsum words", which implies that if count is -1, it should return -1 words (impossible) or handle this case explicitly. Returning 18 words when asked for -1 words clearly violates the stated purpose. A reasonable developer would expect the function to either return 0 words or raise an error for negative counts, not return an arbitrary positive number of words.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal Django utility function not documented in the public API. Negative counts are nonsensical input that no reasonable developer would intentionally pass. The issue only affects edge cases with invalid input that would never occur in legitimate use. The current behavior doesn't cause crashes or security issues - it just returns unexpected but harmless output. Since this is likely never used with negative values in practice, fixing it provides minimal value.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistent behavior between common=True and common=False for negative counts suggests this is unintended behavior rather than a conscious design choice. Even internal utilities should handle edge cases predictably. The fix is trivial (adding a simple check for negative values), so there's no technical reason not to fix it.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior is technically deterministic and follows Python's slicing rules. The documentation (docstring) could be updated to specify that negative counts will use Python's negative slicing semantics, making the current behavior officially correct. This would be the path of least resistance - documenting the quirk rather than changing code that may have existed for years.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior is clearly not intentional - no developer would design a function to return 18 words when asked for -1 words. Documenting this as expected behavior would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it. The behavior is confusing and inconsistent (different results for common=True vs common=False), making it poor design to codify in documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The function currently doesn't validate input parameters. Adding validation for negative counts would be a new feature - input validation that doesn't currently exist. The request is essentially asking for the function to be enhanced with better error handling or edge case handling, which could be seen as a feature addition rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Properly handling invalid input isn't a new feature - it's fixing incorrect behavior. The function already has an implicit contract (return `count` words), and negative counts violate this contract. This isn't asking for new functionality but rather for the existing functionality to work correctly with all inputs.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function violates its stated contract by returning 18 words when count=-1. This is objectively incorrect behavior - the function claims to return `count` words but doesn't. The inconsistent behavior between common=True and common=False suggests this wasn't intentionally designed. The fix is straightforward and would prevent confusing behavior. Any function that returns 18 when asked for -1 of something has a logic error.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an internal utility function with no public documentation or specification about edge cases. The function works perfectly for all valid, positive inputs. Negative counts are nonsensical and passing them is user error. The current behavior follows Python's standard slicing semantics, which could be considered a reasonable default. Since this is unlikely to affect real users and the function is internal, it may not rise to the level of a bug worth filing.

## Overall consideration
This bug report presents a classic edge case handling issue in an internal Django utility function. The function django.utils.lorem_ipsum.words() returns unexpected results when given negative count values, specifically returning 18 words when count=-1 and common=True. While the technical analysis in the bug report is accurate and the behavior is indeed unexpected, several factors suggest this should not be treated as a high-priority bug.

First and foremost, this is an internal utility function in django.utils that lacks public API documentation. Django's utilities are primarily for internal use, and developers using undocumented internal functions do so at their own risk. The function works correctly for all reasonable, positive inputs, which covers virtually all real-world use cases. Passing negative counts to a function asking for a number of words is nonsensical user input that would never occur in legitimate code.

The classification ultimately depends on Django's philosophy toward internal utilities and edge case handling. Given that this function has likely existed for years without this issue being problematic, and considering that the impact is minimal (unexpected but harmless output rather than crashes or security issues), this falls into the category of issues that, while technically incorrect, don't warrant the effort to fix. The bug report, despite being technically accurate, focuses on an obscure edge case in an internal utility that would never affect real users in practice. This is exactly the type of pedantic issue that maintainers often close as WONTFIX or INVALID, as it provides no practical value to fix while potentially introducing risk to stable code.
