## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments Against**:
- The assertion exists specifically to validate that `num_items` matches the actual count
- The assertion works correctly for non-empty cases
- The function's internal usage always passes the correct count
- The error message "Fed in wrong num_items" clearly indicates this is meant to be checked

**Arguments For**: None. The bug is demonstrably real - the assertion check is bypassed for empty iterators.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments For**:
- This is an internal function, not part of the public API
- In practice, internal callers likely always pass correct values
- The impact is low - it only affects error detection, not correctness of results
- Empty iterator with wrong count is an edge case unlikely to occur in real usage

**Arguments Against**:
- The assertion exists for a reason - to catch programming errors
- Inconsistent behavior (assertion works for non-empty but not empty) is confusing
- The fix is trivial (2-3 lines of code)
- Assertions are specifically for catching bugs during development

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For**:
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state the requirement that `num_items` must match
- Could document that the assertion is only enforced for non-empty iterators

**Arguments Against**:
- The assertion itself serves as the contract documentation
- The bug is in the code behavior, not the documentation
- Documenting this inconsistency would be acknowledging a bug rather than fixing it

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For**: None. This is clearly a bug, not a missing feature.

**Arguments Against**:
- The assertion already exists and is intended to work
- This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new functionality

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments For**:
- Clear inconsistency: assertion works for non-empty but not empty iterators
- The assertion's purpose is defeated when it can be bypassed
- The code explicitly tries to validate `num_items` but fails to do so consistently
- The fix is straightforward and makes the behavior consistent
- Other similar validation code in pandas is consistent (doesn't skip validation for edge cases)

**Arguments Against**:
- Low severity - only affects error detection for an internal function
- Unlikely to cause actual problems in practice

### Final Assessment
This is a **BUG**. While it's a low-severity issue in an internal function, it's still a genuine bug where:
1. The code has an explicit assertion to validate input consistency
2. The assertion is bypassed in certain cases (empty iterator)
3. This creates inconsistent behavior that defeats the purpose of the validation
4. The fix is trivial and makes the behavior consistent

The fact that it's internal and low-impact might make it low priority, but it's still a valid bug that violates the function's intended contract.
