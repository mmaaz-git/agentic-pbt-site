TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
   --------------------------------------
   Arguments FOR:
   - The function explicitly promises to match Python's str.replace behavior
   - The documentation states it performs "element-wise string replacement"
   - No documented limitations or exceptions for this case
   - Silently returns incorrect results without errors or warnings
   - The behavior is inconsistent: partial replacements work, full replacements fail
   - Data corruption risk: operations appear to succeed but produce wrong results
   - The bug is reproducible and deterministic

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - None identified

2. INVALID (Incorrect report, code works as intended)
   ---------------------------------------------------
   Arguments FOR:
   - None identified

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug is clearly reproducible
   - Documentation explicitly promises Python str.replace compatibility
   - No documentation suggests this limitation is intentional

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   -------------------------------------
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue replacing entire string with longer string is uncommon

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - replacing strings is fundamental
   - Silent data corruption is never trivial
   - The operation works for partial replacements but not full replacements
   - No errors or warnings are raised - silent failure is dangerous
   - '0' -> '00' or 'a' -> 'aa' are simple, reasonable operations

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Unsupported functionality)
   ---------------------------------------------
   Arguments FOR:
   - None - the documentation explicitly claims this is supported

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Documentation promises full Python str.replace compatibility
   - This is not a new feature but a failure of existing functionality
   - Partial string replacement already works with expansion

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   --------------------------------------------
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could fix by documenting this limitation

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code is wrong, not the documentation
   - Python's str.replace has no such limitation
   - This would be accepting a bug rather than fixing it
   - The inconsistent behavior (partial vs full replacement) suggests a bug

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This is clearly a BUG. The function fails to perform as documented, silently returning incorrect results when replacing an entire string with a longer replacement. The documentation explicitly promises Python str.replace compatibility, which this violates. The silent nature of the failure (no errors, just wrong results) makes this particularly serious as it can lead to data corruption that goes unnoticed.
