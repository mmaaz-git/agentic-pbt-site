## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function's behavior is mathematically correct - it computes the pseudoinverse for non-square matrices as expected. One could argue that "non-singular" in the docstring implicitly refers only to square matrices, since non-square matrices cannot be non-singular in the traditional sense. The implementation works correctly and follows standard mathematical conventions for matrix pseudoinverses.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The docstring explicitly makes a claim that is mathematically impossible: that both ret * self and self * ret equal the same n×n identity matrix for all "non-singular" matrices. Since the code explicitly handles non-square matrices by computing their pseudoinverse, the documentation should accurately describe what happens in that case. The claim creates a ValueError when users try to verify it.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a minor documentation inconsistency in a deprecated module (numpy.matrix is deprecated in favor of regular arrays). The actual functionality works correctly, and users who understand linear algebra will know that pseudoinverses of non-square matrices don't satisfy the same properties as inverses of square matrices. The error only occurs when trying to verify the docstring claim, not in actual usage.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Documentation accuracy is important, especially for mathematical libraries where users rely on precise specifications. Even if the matrix module is deprecated, it's still part of numpy and its documentation should be correct. The fix is trivial (updating a few lines of documentation), and incorrect documentation can confuse users learning linear algebra concepts.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code implementation is entirely correct - it properly computes inverses for square matrices and pseudoinverses for non-square matrices. The only issue is that the docstring makes an incorrect mathematical claim about the properties of these operations. The docstring should be updated to correctly describe that for non-square matrices, the products have different dimensions and satisfy different properties (Moore-Penrose conditions).

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There are no strong reasons against this categorization. This is clearly a documentation issue where the code works correctly but the documentation incorrectly describes its behavior.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that the user wants better documentation or clearer explanation of pseudoinverse properties, which could be seen as requesting an enhancement to the documentation rather than fixing a bug.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality or enhanced features. The issue is pointing out that existing documentation contains a factually incorrect statement. Fixing incorrect documentation is a bug fix, not a feature request. The user isn't asking for new capabilities but for the documentation to accurately describe current behavior.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The docstring contains a demonstrably false mathematical claim that causes errors when users try to verify it. This could be considered a bug in the documentation that should be fixed to prevent user confusion.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The actual code functionality is completely correct - there's no bug in the implementation. The term "bug" typically refers to code defects, not documentation issues. Since the code behaves correctly according to mathematical principles, and only the documentation is wrong, this is more accurately a documentation fix rather than a code bug.

**Overall consideration**
The bug report correctly identifies a clear error in the documentation. The docstring for matrix.I makes a mathematically impossible claim about non-square matrices: that both m.I * m and m * m.I equal np.eye(m[0,:].size). For a non-square m×n matrix, these products have shapes n×n and m×m respectively, so they cannot both equal the same identity matrix. The reproduction confirms this raises a ValueError when users attempt to verify the documented behavior.

The implementation itself is correct - it properly uses numpy.linalg.inv for square matrices and numpy.linalg.pinv for non-square matrices, and the pseudoinverse satisfies all Moore-Penrose conditions. The issue is purely in the documentation making an incorrect claim about the mathematical properties of the returned value.

Given that this is deprecated functionality (numpy.matrix is discouraged), the documentation is technically incorrect but the code works properly, and the fix would be trivial (updating a few lines of docstring), this should be categorized as DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The docstring should be updated to correctly distinguish between the inverse properties for square matrices and pseudoinverse properties for non-square matrices.
