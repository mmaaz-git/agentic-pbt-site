REPRODUCTION OF BUG

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. TEST EXECUTION:
   - When calling symbolic.eliminate_quotes('"'), the function raises AssertionError
   - When calling symbolic.eliminate_quotes("'"), the function raises AssertionError
   - The property-based test from the bug report fails on both inputs: s='"' and s="'"

2. CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
   - The function works correctly with properly quoted strings:
     - eliminate_quotes('"hello"') returns ('@__f2py_QUOTES_DOUBLE_1@', {'@__f2py_QUOTES_DOUBLE_1@': '"hello"'})
     - eliminate_quotes("'hello'") returns ('@__f2py_QUOTES_SINGLE_2@', {'@__f2py_QUOTES_SINGLE_2@': "'hello'"})

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   - The function uses regex patterns to match complete quoted strings (with opening and closing quotes)
   - When given a single unmatched quote, the regex doesn't match it
   - The quote character remains in the new_s variable
   - The function then hits the assertions: assert '"' not in new_s and assert "'" not in new_s
   - These assertions fail, causing AssertionError

4. PYTHON -O FLAG ISSUE:
   - When running with python3 -O (optimization mode), assertions are disabled
   - The function returns incorrect output: ('"', {}) for input '"'
   - This silently produces wrong results instead of failing

5. IMPACT:
   - The function crashes on malformed input (unmatched quotes)
   - Uses non-semantic AssertionError instead of proper exceptions
   - With -O flag, produces incorrect output silently
   - The roundtrip property (eliminate_quotes â†’ insert_quotes) fails on these inputs

The bug is confirmed and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
