DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

OFFICIAL DEPRECATION STATUS:
----------------------------
1. NumPy 2.3.0 Release Notes:
   - NBitBase is officially deprecated in NumPy 2.3
   - Clear deprecation notice in release notes
   - Recommended alternative: Use @typing.overload or TypeVar with scalar-type upper bound
   - Pull request #28884 implemented the deprecation

2. NBitBase Class Documentation (numpy/_typing/_nbit_base.py):
   - Line 20-22: Explicit deprecation notice in docstring
   - States: "deprecated:: 2.3"
   - Provides migration guidance to use @typing.overload or TypeVar
   - Line 55: Comment confirms "Deprecated in NumPy 2.3, 2025-05-01"

3. Module-level __getattr__ Implementation:
   - Lines 176-183 in numpy/typing/__init__.py
   - Contains deprecation warning text matching the documentation
   - Intended to emit DeprecationWarning when NBitBase is accessed
   - Comment explicitly states: "# Deprecated in NumPy 2.3, 2025-05-01"

DOCUMENTED INTENT vs ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
-------------------------------------
The documentation clearly establishes that:
1. NBitBase SHOULD emit a deprecation warning when accessed
2. The warning text is defined and ready in __getattr__
3. The deprecation is official as of NumPy 2.3

The actual behavior violates this documented intent because:
- No warning is emitted when accessing NBitBase
- Users are not informed about the deprecation
- The deprecation mechanism exists but is bypassed

DEPRECATION TIMELINE:
--------------------
- Deprecated in: NumPy 2.3 (2025-05-01)
- Will be removed: Future version (unspecified)
- Current status: Should be warning users but isn't

CONCLUSION:
----------
The documentation unambiguously states that NBitBase is deprecated and should emit warnings. The code contains the deprecation mechanism, but it's not functioning due to the import structure. This is a clear violation of the documented behavior and deprecation policy.
