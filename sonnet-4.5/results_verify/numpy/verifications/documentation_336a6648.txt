DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## SparseArray.cumsum Documentation

### Internal Documentation (from source code):

The cumsum method in pandas/core/arrays/sparse/array.py has the following docstring:

```
Cumulative sum of values.

When performing the cumulative summation, any non-NA/null values will
be skipped. The resulting SparseArray will preserve the locations of
NaN values, but the fill value will be `np.nan` regardless.

Parameters
----------
axis : int or None
    Axis over which to perform the cumulative summation. If None,
    perform cumulative summation over flattened array.

Returns
-------
cumsum : SparseArray
```

### Public API Documentation:

The public pandas documentation does not have a dedicated page for SparseArray.cumsum. The general SparseArray documentation only mentions that it is "an ExtensionArray for storing sparse data efficiently, where a single value is repeated many times (e.g. `0` or `NaN`)."

### NumPy cumsum Behavior (Reference Standard):

NumPy's cumsum is documented as:
"Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis."

For numpy.array([1, 2, 3]), cumsum returns [1, 3, 6].
For arrays with zeros like [0, 1, 0, 2, 0], cumsum returns [0, 1, 1, 3, 3].

## Key Documentation Findings:

1. **The documentation clearly states cumsum should return a cumulative sum** - This is an unambiguous mathematical operation that should produce predictable results.

2. **The method is expected to return a SparseArray** - Not crash with a RecursionError.

3. **The docstring mentions handling of NaN values** but does not indicate that integer arrays with fill_value=0 should fail or behave differently in terms of basic functionality.

4. **No documentation suggests infinite recursion is expected behavior** - The documentation promises a cumulative sum result, not an error.

5. **Pandas SparseArrays are meant to be drop-in replacements for regular arrays** in many contexts, supporting standard array operations like cumsum.

## Conclusion:

The documentation clearly indicates that cumsum() should compute and return a cumulative sum as a SparseArray. There is no indication that:
- Integer arrays should fail
- RecursionError is an expected outcome
- Arrays with non-null fill values should behave differently

The current behavior (infinite recursion) directly contradicts the documented purpose of the method, which is to return the cumulative sum of values.
