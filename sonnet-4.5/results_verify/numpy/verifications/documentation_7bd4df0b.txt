## Documentation Analysis for numpy.matrixlib.bmat

The official documentation for `numpy.bmat` states:

**Parameters:**
- `obj`: str or array_like - Input data. If a string, variables in the current scope may be referenced by name.
- `ldict`: dict, optional - A dictionary that replaces local operands in current frame. Ignored if `obj` is not a string or `gdict` is None.
- `gdict`: dict, optional - A dictionary that replaces global operands in current frame. Ignored if `obj` is not a string.

**Key observations from the documentation:**

1. Both `ldict` and `gdict` are marked as optional parameters.

2. The documentation states that `ldict` is "Ignored if `obj` is not a string or `gdict` is None." This implies that when `gdict` is provided (not None), `ldict` may be used.

3. The documentation says `gdict` is "Ignored if `obj` is not a string", but doesn't say what happens when `gdict` is provided without `ldict`.

4. The examples show using string syntax like `np.bmat('A,B; C,D')` where A, B, C, D are variables in the current scope, but none of the examples demonstrate using `gdict` or `ldict` parameters explicitly.

5. The documentation doesn't explicitly state that `ldict` must be provided when `gdict` is provided, nor does it say that omitting `ldict` when providing `gdict` should work.

**Source code analysis:**

Looking at the implementation, when a string is provided:
- If `gdict` is None, it uses the caller's frame to get both global and local dictionaries
- If `gdict` is not None, it uses the provided `gdict` and sets `loc_dict = ldict` (which could be None)
- The `_from_string` function then tries to access `ldict[col]` directly without checking if `ldict` is None first

The documentation is ambiguous about whether providing `gdict` without `ldict` should be supported. It doesn't explicitly state that both must be provided together, but the optional nature of both parameters suggests they should be independently optional.
