BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Considering each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed):
   STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
   - The documentation explicitly states the function should behave "Like in the regular Python `slice` object"
   - Python's slice(0, None) clearly means "from index 0 to the end"
   - The function returns incorrect results: empty string instead of the full string when stop=None
   - The behavior is inconsistent - nps.slice(arr, None, None) works correctly but nps.slice(arr, 0, None) doesn't
   - This is a fundamental operation that users would expect to work correctly
   - The bug affects a core functionality of string slicing

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - None

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The bug is reproducible
   - The documentation clearly specifies the expected behavior
   - Python's slice semantics are well-established and documented

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/obscure error):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Users could work around by passing the string length instead of None

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - using None for "to the end" is standard Python
   - The workaround requires knowing the string length, which defeats the purpose of None
   - This breaks basic Python slice compatibility

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The documentation already claims this is supported behavior
   - The function partially works with None values (when both are None)
   - This is not a new feature but a bug in existing functionality

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - One could argue the documentation should clarify None handling

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - The documentation is correct - it states the function should work like Python's slice
   - The code is wrong, not the documentation
   - Changing the documentation to match the buggy behavior would break user expectations

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
=================

The evidence overwhelmingly supports categorizing this as a BUG:

1. Clear documentation violation - The function explicitly claims to work "Like in the regular Python `slice` object" but doesn't
2. Standard Python semantics - slice(start, None) has well-defined meaning in Python
3. Inconsistent behavior - The function handles None correctly in some cases but not others
4. User impact - This breaks expected behavior for a common operation
5. No ambiguity - There's no reasonable interpretation where the current behavior is correct

The bug appears to be in the implementation where stop=None with a non-None start value is being mishandled, possibly treating None as 0 or using start as the count of characters to return instead of as the starting index.
