REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix.matrix.I BUG REPORT

TEST 1: EXACT REPRODUCTION FROM BUG REPORT
The bug report's test case was successfully reproduced:
- Created a non-square matrix m of shape (2, 3)
- Computed pseudoinverse m.I of shape (3, 2)
- Product inv * m has shape (3, 3)
- Product m * inv has shape (2, 2)
- Attempting to compare m * inv with np.eye(3) raises ValueError due to shape mismatch
- This confirms the bug report's claim about shape incompatibility

TEST 2: HYPOTHESIS TEST CASE
The zero matrix case from the hypothesis test:
- Zero matrix of shape (2, 3) produces pseudoinverse of shape (3, 2)
- Products do not equal identity matrices (they are zero matrices)
- Shape mismatch error occurs when comparing as described in docstring

TEST 3: SQUARE MATRIX CONTROL TEST
Testing with square non-singular matrix (the case that SHOULD work):
- Square matrix [[1,2],[3,4]] correctly produces inverse
- Both products (inv * m and m * inv) equal identity matrix within numerical precision
- This confirms the docstring IS correct for square matrices

TEST 4: IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION
Direct examination of the source code confirms:
- For square matrices (M == N): uses numpy.linalg.inv
- For non-square matrices (M != N): uses numpy.linalg.pinv
- The .I property returns pinv for non-square matrices, not a true inverse

TEST 5: MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION
Verified Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse conditions:
- A * A+ * A = A ✓
- A+ * A * A+ = A+ ✓
- (A * A+) is symmetric ✓
- (A+ * A) is symmetric ✓
All conditions satisfied - the implementation is mathematically correct.

CONCLUSION:
The bug report is technically correct. The docstring incorrectly states that for non-singular matrices, both ret * self and self * ret equal np.eye(self[0,:].size). This is impossible for non-square matrices due to shape mismatch. The implementation is correct (uses pseudoinverse for non-square matrices), but the documentation is wrong.
