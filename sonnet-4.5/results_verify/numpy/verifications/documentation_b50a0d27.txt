## Documentation Analysis

### NumPy Documentation
The numpy.char module documentation states that it provides "a set of vectorized string operations for arrays" that are "based on the methods in string module". This clearly indicates these functions should behave like Python's standard string methods, but operating element-wise on arrays.

Key findings from NumPy documentation:
1. The numpy.char module provides vectorized versions of string operations
2. These operations are described as being "based on" Python's string methods
3. The module is marked as legacy (but still functional and documented)
4. No special mention of null byte handling or exceptions for special characters

### Python String Method Documentation
Python's standard string methods have well-defined behavior:
- `str.find()`: Returns the lowest index of substring, or -1 if not found
- `str.rfind()`: Returns the highest index of substring, or -1 if not found
- `str.count()`: Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring
- `str.startswith()`: Returns True if string starts with the prefix, False otherwise
- `str.endswith()`: Returns True if string ends with the suffix, False otherwise
- `str.index()`: Like find(), but raises ValueError when substring is not found

### Null Byte Handling in Python
Testing confirms Python treats null bytes (\x00) as regular characters:
- Null bytes can appear anywhere in Python strings
- String methods search for null bytes just like any other character
- Empty strings do not implicitly contain null bytes
- Strings do not have implicit null terminators

### Expected Behavior
Based on the documentation stating numpy.char functions are "based on" Python's string methods and provide "vectorized string operations", the expected behavior is clear:
1. numpy.char functions should produce the same results as Python's string methods
2. Null bytes should be treated as regular searchable characters
3. Functions should not assume C-style null termination

### Documentation Verdict
The documentation clearly establishes that numpy.char functions should behave identically to Python's string methods when operating on individual array elements. The current behavior with null bytes violates this documented contract. There is no mention in the documentation of any special handling or limitations regarding null bytes or Unicode characters.
