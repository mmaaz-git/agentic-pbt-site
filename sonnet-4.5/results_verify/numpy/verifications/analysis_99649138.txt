## Bug Report Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The function's documentation explicitly states it accepts "array_like" inputs
- NumPy's official definition of "array_like" includes Python lists
- The function crashes with an AttributeError when given lists, which is clearly incorrect behavior
- Other similar functions in numpy.ma (like make_mask and getmask) correctly handle lists
- Core NumPy functions (like logical_or) correctly handle lists as array_like inputs
- The crash is not a graceful failure with an informative error message, but an AttributeError accessing None.names
- The inconsistency within the numpy.ma module makes this a clear bug

**Arguments against BUG:**
- None. This is a clear violation of the documented interface.

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
- None. The documentation is explicit about accepting array_like inputs.

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The documentation clearly states the function accepts array_like inputs
- NumPy's definition of array_like explicitly includes lists
- The bug report correctly identifies the issue and provides accurate reproduction steps

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- None. This is not an obscure edge case but a fundamental failure to handle documented input types.

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- Lists are a common Python data structure, not an obscure input type
- The function's primary purpose is to combine masks, which users might naturally provide as lists
- The fix is straightforward (converting inputs to arrays)
- The issue breaks basic functionality promised by the documentation

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- One could argue the documentation should be updated to say it only accepts numpy arrays

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- This would be inconsistent with NumPy's conventions and other functions in the same module
- Other mask functions (make_mask, getmask) correctly handle array_like inputs
- The fix to the code is simpler and more appropriate than changing documentation
- Changing documentation would break backward compatibility expectations

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- None. The documentation already promises this functionality.

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not requesting new functionality but reporting broken existing functionality
- The documentation already states the function accepts array_like inputs

### Conclusion
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The function fails to implement its documented interface by crashing when given Python lists as inputs, despite explicitly documenting that it accepts "array_like" inputs. The crash is due to a coding error (accessing .names on None) rather than an intentional restriction. The fix is straightforward and would bring the function in line with both its documentation and NumPy conventions.
