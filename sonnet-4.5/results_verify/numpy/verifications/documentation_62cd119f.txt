## Documentation Analysis for numpy.random.gamma

### NumPy Documentation Findings

1. **Parameter Constraints**
   - The NumPy documentation states that shape and scale parameters must be "non-negative"
   - The documentation also states both parameters must be "> 0" (positive)
   - This is a slight inconsistency in the documentation itself

2. **Mathematical Definition**
   - The probability density function provided is: p(x) = x^(k-1) * e^(-x/θ) / (θ^k * Γ(k))
   - This is the standard gamma distribution PDF

3. **Support Not Explicitly Stated**
   - The NumPy documentation does NOT explicitly state what the support of the distribution is
   - It does not specify whether the output should be in (0, ∞) or [0, ∞)
   - There are NO warnings about numerical precision issues or underflow with small parameters
   - There are NO documented limitations on the valid range of shape parameters beyond "> 0"

### Mathematical Reference (Wikipedia)

1. **Support Definition**
   - Wikipedia defines the support of the gamma distribution as x ∈ [0, ∞)
   - This notation includes zero as a valid output value
   - This contradicts the bug report's claim that support should be (0, ∞)

2. **Mathematical Properties**
   - Both shape parameters (α and θ/λ) must be strictly positive
   - For α < 1, the mode of the distribution is at 0
   - The PDF is defined for x > 0, but the support includes 0

### Key Finding
There is a mathematical ambiguity here. While the Wikipedia article uses [0, ∞) notation (including zero), many practical implementations and theoretical discussions treat the gamma distribution as having support (0, ∞) (excluding zero). The NumPy documentation does not clarify which interpretation it follows.

### Documentation Gaps
1. NumPy does not specify the exact support of its gamma distribution implementation
2. NumPy does not document any numerical limitations or precision issues
3. NumPy does not warn about potential underflow with extreme parameter values
4. The inconsistency between "non-negative" and "> 0" for parameter constraints needs clarification
