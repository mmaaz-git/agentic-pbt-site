## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation explicitly states "ndim : int, optional" but function accepts non-integer values
- Accepting float values like 2.5 creates broken pointer types that can never validate arrays correctly
- float('inf') and float('nan') cause crashes with OverflowError/ValueError
- This is a clear contract violation - the function doesn't enforce its documented requirements
- The broken behavior is not a corner case - it affects core functionality
- Similar NumPy functions properly validate integer parameters

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The documentation is clear, and the implementation doesn't match.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation explicitly requires integer type
- The current behavior is clearly broken and unusable
- The errors that occur are not the intended validation errors

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that passing non-integers to ndim is user error

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Not an obscure edge case - basic parameter validation is expected
- The function silently accepts invalid input and creates broken objects
- Causes crashes rather than helpful error messages
- Other NumPy functions validate similar parameters

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The documentation already specifies integers are required.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This isn't requesting new functionality
- The documentation already defines the expected behavior
- This is fixing broken existing functionality

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could change docs to say "ndim accepts any numeric type but may cause errors"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation correctly specifies the intended behavior
- The implementation is what's broken, not the documentation
- Accepting non-integers serves no useful purpose and only causes errors
- Would be backwards to change docs to match broken behavior

### Conclusion
This is a clear **BUG**. The function accepts invalid input that violates its documented contract, leading to broken behavior and crashes. The fix is straightforward - validate that ndim is an integer when provided, exactly as the documentation specifies.
