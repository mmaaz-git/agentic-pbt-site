REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
===================

Bug Report Claim:
The numpy.random.wald function produces negative values when called with very small scale parameters, specifically with mean=1.0 and scale=1e-10.

Reproduction Results:

1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction:
   - Ran the provided property-based test with Hypothesis
   - Test FAILED as expected with mean=1.0, scale=1e-10
   - Minimum value produced: -8.274037099909037e-08
   - This confirms the bug exists and Hypothesis can find it

2. Simple Example Reproduction:
   - Ran the provided simple example code with fixed seed (PCG64(42))
   - Results match the bug report exactly:
     * 60 out of 100 values were negative
     * Minimum value: -8.274037e-08
     * Maximum value: 2.137706e-06

3. Pattern of Negative Values:
   - Multiple negative values observed, not just outliers
   - Negative values appear to cluster around two values:
     * -1.3351431960e-08
     * -8.2740370999e-08
   - This suggests systematic numerical issues rather than random errors

Conclusion:
The bug is fully reproduced. The numpy.random.wald function indeed produces negative values when given very small scale parameters (1e-10), which violates the mathematical definition of the Wald distribution that should only produce positive values.

The effect is significant - 60% of generated values are negative in the test case, making this a serious correctness issue for users working with extreme parameter values.
