## Documentation Analysis

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **Primary Documentation Quote from numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html**:
   > "Note that if a field has the same name as an ndarray attribute, the ndarray attribute takes precedence. Such fields will be inaccessible by attribute but will still be accessible by index."

   This is a critical finding that directly addresses the issue raised in the bug report.

2. **Feature Description**:
   The documentation states that record arrays allow "fields to be accessed as members of the array, using `arr.x` and `arr.y`" as an alternative to dictionary-style access.

3. **Documentation Coverage**:
   - The documentation DOES explicitly state that ndarray attributes take precedence over field names
   - The documentation DOES state that conflicting fields will be inaccessible by attribute
   - The documentation DOES state that conflicting fields remain accessible by index (dictionary-style)
   - The documentation correctly describes the current behavior

### Analysis of Bug Report Claims

The bug report claims this violates the documented API contract. However, upon careful review:

1. The documentation explicitly warns about this limitation
2. The behavior is documented as intentional (ndarray attributes take precedence)
3. The alternative access method (dictionary-style) is documented as available

### Conclusion

The behavior described in the bug report is actually documented behavior, not a bug. The numpy documentation explicitly states that:
- Fields with names matching ndarray attributes will not be accessible via attribute access
- These fields remain accessible via index/dictionary access
- This is by design, with ndarray attributes taking precedence

This is not a violation of the API contract, but rather a documented limitation of the recarray implementation.
