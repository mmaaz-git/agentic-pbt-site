## Bug Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug and verified the technical details.

### Test Environment
- NumPy version: 2.3.0
- Test case: `numpy.random.uniform(-5e-324, 0.0)`

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis test passes**: The property-based test using Hypothesis does not find failures with normal floating-point ranges, indicating this is specific to extremely small ranges.

2. **Specific failing case confirmed**: With `low=-5e-324` and `high=0.0`:
   - Approximately 50% of generated values violate the upper bound
   - All violations return exactly `0.0` (not values near 0.0)
   - This behavior is consistent across different random seeds

3. **Violation rates across seeds**:
   - Seed 123: 50.4% violations
   - Seed 1: 50.6% violations
   - Seed 3: 51.2% violations
   - Average: ~50% violation rate

### Technical Analysis

1. **The value -5e-324 is significant**:
   - It is a subnormal (denormalized) number
   - It's the smallest representable negative float in IEEE 754
   - Hex representation: -0x0.0000000000001p-1022

2. **Floating-point arithmetic breakdown**:
   The likely implementation formula `low + (high - low) * random_unit` produces:
   - When random_unit â‰¥ ~0.5: Result rounds to exactly 0.0
   - When random_unit < ~0.5: Result stays at -5e-324
   - No intermediate values exist between -5e-324 and 0.0

3. **Range analysis**:
   - Range [-5e-324, 0.0): ~50% violations
   - Range [-1e-323, 0.0): ~24% violations
   - Range [-2.225e-308, 0.0) (smallest normal): 0% violations
   - When low rounds to 0.0 (e.g., -1e-324): 100% violations

4. **New Generator API has same issue**:
   The recommended np.random.Generator.uniform() shows identical behavior with ~50% violation rate, indicating this is a fundamental implementation issue, not specific to the legacy API.

### Conclusion
The bug report is technically accurate. The function does return values equal to `high` when dealing with subnormal number ranges, violating the documented half-open interval `[low, high)`. This occurs because there are only two representable float values in the range [-5e-324, 0.0]: the value -5e-324 itself and 0.0.
