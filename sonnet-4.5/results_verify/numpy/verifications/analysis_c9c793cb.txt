## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR categorizing as BUG:**
1. The function returns invalid indices `[0, -1]` that cannot be used to access elements in an empty array
2. The second index (-1) is less than the first index (0), violating the natural expectation for "edges"
3. The behavior is inconsistent with the function's purpose of returning valid indices of unmasked values
4. An empty array has no unmasked values, similar to an all-masked array which returns `None`
5. The returned indices are unusable and would cause errors if used for array indexing
6. The bug is in a public API function that users rely on for data processing

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly specify behavior for empty arrays
- Could argue this is an edge case not covered by the specification

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR categorizing as INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state what should happen with empty arrays
- The function "expects a 1-D MaskedArray" and an empty array is technically still a valid 1-D array

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The returned indices are objectively invalid and unusable
- Returning `[0, -1]` serves no practical purpose and would cause downstream errors
- The semantic meaning of the function (finding edges of unmasked values) is violated

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR categorizing as WONTFIX:**
- Empty arrays might be considered an obscure edge case
- Users could add checks before calling the function

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure case - empty arrays are common in data processing
- The fix is trivial (2-3 lines of code)
- The current behavior produces invalid output that will cause errors

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR categorizing as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to specify that empty arrays return `[0, -1]`
- Could document this as expected behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The current behavior produces objectively invalid indices
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
- The indices `[0, -1]` cannot be used for any practical purpose

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR categorizing as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could frame this as requesting new handling for empty arrays
- The documentation doesn't promise specific behavior for empty arrays

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already handles the conceptually similar case of all-masked arrays
- Returning invalid indices is a bug, not missing functionality

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG** because:
1. The function returns objectively invalid indices that violate basic invariants (second index < first index)
2. The indices cannot be used for their intended purpose (array indexing)
3. The behavior is inconsistent with the function's semantic purpose
4. Empty arrays are a reasonable input that should be handled correctly
5. The fix is straightforward and the correct behavior (returning None) is obvious from the similar all-masked case
