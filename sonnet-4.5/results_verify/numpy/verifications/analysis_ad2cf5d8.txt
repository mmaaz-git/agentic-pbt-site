## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: Integer division by zero (`'1 / 0'`) works correctly and creates a symbolic expression, but float division by zero (`'1.5 / 0'`) crashes. This inconsistency is unexpected.
2. **Violates symbolic nature**: The module is explicitly designed for symbolic expression parsing, not numeric evaluation. Line 870 performs actual division when it should keep expressions symbolic.
3. **No documentation justifies the crash**: There's no documentation stating that float division by zero should fail while integer division by zero succeeds.
4. **The fix is straightforward**: The proposed fix correctly handles the edge case without breaking other functionality.
5. **Real-world impact**: Users parsing Fortran/C expressions containing float divisions by zero will encounter crashes, limiting the parser's utility.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Could argue that float division by zero is mathematically undefined, but this doesn't explain why integer division by zero works.

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Division by zero is mathematically undefined, so crashing might be considered correct behavior.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **Integer division by zero works**: The parser already handles `'1 / 0'` correctly as a symbolic expression.
2. **Purpose is symbolic**: This is a symbolic parser, not a calculator. It should represent expressions, not evaluate them.
3. **No documentation supports this**: There's no documentation saying float division should behave differently from integer division.

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be considered an obscure edge case that rarely occurs in practice.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **Not that obscure**: Division by zero can appear in symbolic expressions, especially in generated code or template expressions.
2. **Easy to fix**: The fix is simple and doesn't require major refactoring.
3. **Inconsistency is problematic**: Having different behavior for integer vs float division is confusing and error-prone.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that float division by zero is not supported.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **The behavior is clearly wrong**: The inconsistency between integer and float handling suggests a bug, not a documentation issue.
2. **Goes against module purpose**: Documenting this limitation would contradict the module's purpose as a symbolic expression parser.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that supporting float division by zero is a new feature.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **Integer version already works**: This isn't adding new functionality; it's fixing inconsistent behavior.
2. **Bug not feature**: The code crashes with an exception, which is clearly a bug, not a missing feature.

### CONCLUSION
This is a **BUG**. The parser should handle all symbolic expressions consistently. The fact that integer division by zero works correctly while float division by zero crashes is a clear inconsistency that violates the module's purpose as a symbolic expression parser. The normalize() function incorrectly attempts to evaluate float division at line 870 instead of keeping it symbolic.
