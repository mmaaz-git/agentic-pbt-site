# Documentation Analysis

## numpy.strings.replace Documentation
The official NumPy documentation for numpy.strings.replace states:
- Function: `numpy.strings.replace(a, old, new, count=-1)`
- Purpose: "Replaces occurrences of a substring in each element of an array"
- Returns: "a copy of strings with specified replacements"
- Parameters match Python's str.replace: old (substring to replace), new (replacement), count (optional limit)

The documentation provides examples showing the function replacing substrings within strings, and there are no documented limitations or exceptions for single-character strings or cases where the entire string needs replacement.

## Python str.replace Documentation
Python's native str.replace method documentation states:
- Returns "a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new"
- When count is not specified or is -1, all occurrences are replaced
- This is standard, well-established behavior in Python

## Expected Behavior Alignment
Based on the documentation analysis:

1. **numpy.strings.replace is designed to mimic Python's str.replace**: The function signature and parameter names are identical, suggesting intentional compatibility.

2. **No documented exceptions**: The NumPy documentation does not mention any special cases, limitations, or deviations from Python's native behavior for:
   - Single-character strings
   - Cases where the entire string is replaced
   - Cases where the replacement is longer than the original

3. **Vectorized equivalent**: The numpy.strings module provides "vectorized string operations" that should behave like their Python counterparts but work on arrays.

4. **Clear expectation**: Users would reasonably expect `numpy.strings.replace(['a'], 'a', 'aa')` to return `['aa']` based on:
   - The function name and parameters matching Python's str.replace
   - The lack of any documented exceptions
   - The general principle that NumPy string functions provide vectorized versions of Python string methods

## Conclusion
The documentation establishes that numpy.strings.replace should behave identically to Python's str.replace for each element in the array. There are no documented exceptions or limitations that would justify the current behavior where 'a'.replace('a', 'aa') returns 'a' instead of 'aa'.
