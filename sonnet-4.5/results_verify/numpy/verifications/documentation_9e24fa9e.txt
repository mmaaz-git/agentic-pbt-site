## Documentation Analysis for numpy.strings.replace

### Official Documentation
The NumPy documentation for `numpy.strings.replace` states:
- "For each element in ``a``, return a copy of the string with occurrences of substring ``old`` replaced by ``new``."
- The function signature is: `numpy.strings.replace(a, old, new, count=-1)`
- The documentation explicitly references Python's `str.replace` in "See Also" section
- The documentation describes it as performing string replacement "for each element in the input array"

### Key Documentation Points
1. The function is described as operating similarly to Python's `str.replace()` method
2. No special handling or exceptions for null characters (`\x00`) are documented
3. The examples provided use normal ASCII strings, not special characters
4. The documentation does not mention any differences from Python's `str.replace` behavior

### Python str.replace Behavior
Python's built-in `str.replace(old, new)` treats null character (`\x00`) as a regular character:
- `'abc'.replace('\x00', 'X')` returns `'abc'` (no replacement since no null chars)
- `'a\x00b'.replace('\x00', 'X')` returns `'aXb'` (replaces the null char)
- Null character is NOT treated as empty string in Python

### Expected Behavior Based on Documentation
Since the documentation states that `numpy.strings.replace` should behave like Python's `str.replace` for each element, the expected behavior is:
- Null characters should be treated as regular characters
- Only actual null characters in the string should be replaced
- Strings without null characters should remain unchanged when replacing null chars

### Conclusion from Documentation
The documentation implies that `numpy.strings.replace` should behave identically to Python's `str.replace` method. There is no documented special behavior for null characters that would justify the observed behavior of treating `\x00` as an empty string.
