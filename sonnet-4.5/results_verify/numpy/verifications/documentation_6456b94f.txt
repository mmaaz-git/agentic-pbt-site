## Documentation Analysis for numpy.linalg.eig

After reviewing the numpy.linalg.eig documentation, here are the key findings:

### What the Documentation Guarantees:
1. **Mathematical Definition**: The documentation explicitly states that for each eigenvalue-eigenvector pair, the fundamental equation should hold: `a @ eigenvectors[:,i] = eigenvalues[i] * eigenvectors[:,i]`

2. **Implementation Details**: The function uses LAPACK's `_geev` routines for computation.

3. **Error Handling**: The function may raise `LinAlgError` if the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

### What the Documentation Does NOT Specify:
1. **Numerical Precision Tolerance**: The documentation does not specify what tolerance levels are considered acceptable for the eigenvalue equation. It does not state whether small violations of the equation are expected or acceptable.

2. **Handling of Ill-Conditioned Matrices**: There is no explicit mention of how the function handles matrices with extreme value ranges (like mixing values of 1.0 with 1e-38).

3. **Accuracy Guarantees**: The documentation warns that eigenvector columns "may not be maximally linearly independent" and that "round-off errors can obscure linear dependence," but it does not quantify acceptable error bounds.

4. **Input Validation**: No mention of input validation for matrices with extreme condition numbers or value ranges.

5. **When Results May Be Incorrect**: The documentation does not warn users that the function may return mathematically incorrect results for certain types of matrices without raising an error.

### Important Note:
The documentation does recommend using `scipy.linalg.schur` for unitary/normal matrices for better numerical stability, implying that numpy.linalg.eig may have numerical stability limitations, but these limitations are not explicitly detailed.

### Conclusion:
The documentation clearly states that the eigenvalue equation `A @ v = Î» * v` should be satisfied. It does not provide any exceptions or tolerances where this fundamental mathematical property is allowed to be violated. A violation with an error magnitude of 1.0 (as in this bug report) is not covered by any documented limitation or expected behavior.
