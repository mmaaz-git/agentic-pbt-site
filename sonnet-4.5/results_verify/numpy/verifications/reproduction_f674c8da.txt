BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

The bug report is confirmed to be reproducible.

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Created test cases using both simple direct calls and hypothesis-based property testing
2. Tested calling cast() as an instance method: p.cast(Polynomial)
3. Confirmed the AttributeError occurs consistently

OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:
- When cast() is called as an instance method (e.g., p.cast(Polynomial)), it crashes with:
  AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'window'
- This happens for ALL polynomial coefficients, not just [0.0]
- The error is consistent and reproducible in every test case

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Since cast() is a classmethod, Python allows it to be called on instances
- When called as p.cast(Polynomial), it should cast the polynomial p to the Polynomial type
- This should work because classmethods can be invoked through instances in Python

ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:
The bug report correctly identifies the issue. When cast() is called as an instance method:
1. Python binds the instance (p) as the first argument (cls)
2. The user's argument Polynomial becomes the second argument (series)
3. Inside cast(), it tries to call series.convert() where series is now the Polynomial class
4. Since Polynomial is a class (not an instance), convert() gets called incorrectly
5. The positional arguments shift, causing the AttributeError when accessing 'window' on an ndarray

IMPACT:
This is a real bug that affects any user who tries to use cast() as an instance method, which is a reasonable expectation given Python's classmethod behavior. The error message is also confusing and doesn't help users understand what went wrong.
