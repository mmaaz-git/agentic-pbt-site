## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID:
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The function technically does raise an error when given invalid input
- Some might argue that any error is sufficient for invalid input

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The documentation clearly states the parameter type requirements
- The current error (AttributeError) is misleading and doesn't indicate user error
- The error message doesn't help users understand what they did wrong
- Other numpy functions (like dtype) handle this properly with clear errors

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- This is a low-severity issue that only affects users who violate the documented contract
- Users who pass integers instead of strings are already doing something wrong
- The error does occur, just not with an ideal message

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - passing wrong types is a common mistake
- The fix is trivial (a few lines of validation code)
- numpy.dtype already demonstrates the right way to handle this
- Good error messages are important for user experience

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be clearer about what happens with invalid input

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation is already clear that names must be strings
- The issue is not with the documentation but with the implementation
- The code behavior (crashing with AttributeError) is not reasonable even if documented

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Better error messages could be seen as a new feature
- Input validation could be considered an enhancement

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Proper input validation is expected behavior, not a feature
- numpy.dtype already does this correctly, showing it's standard practice

### Considering BUG:
**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Contract Violation**: The function doesn't validate its documented input requirements
2. **Misleading Error**: AttributeError suggests an internal problem, not user error
3. **Inconsistency**: numpy.dtype handles the same situation correctly with clear errors
4. **Poor User Experience**: Users must read source code to understand what went wrong
5. **Easy to Fix**: Simple validation would prevent the confusing error
6. **Not Edge Case**: Passing wrong types is a common programming mistake

**Why it might not be a BUG:**
- The function does fail (doesn't silently accept invalid input)
- Technically, an error is raised

### Final Assessment:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function fails to validate its inputs according to its documented contract and crashes with a misleading error message. The fact that numpy.dtype handles this correctly shows that numpy has established patterns for proper error handling. The fix is trivial and would significantly improve user experience.
