## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Evidence:**
1. The deprecation warning mechanism is clearly implemented in the code but fails to execute
2. Documentation explicitly states NBitBase is deprecated since NumPy 2.3
3. The __getattr__ function contains the correct deprecation warning code
4. The bug report correctly identifies the technical cause: NBitBase is imported directly, bypassing __getattr__
5. This is a failure of the deprecation mechanism, which is a core API contract feature
6. Users won't be warned about using deprecated functionality, preventing them from updating their code

**Why this IS a bug:**
- The intended behavior (showing deprecation warning) is clearly documented
- The mechanism exists but doesn't work due to implementation error
- This affects all users of NBitBase who won't know to migrate their code

### Consideration for INVALID
**Potential Arguments:**
- None. The code clearly intends to show a deprecation warning and fails to do so.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Potential Arguments:**
1. NBitBase still works functionally, only the warning is missing
2. The deprecation is documented in release notes and API docs

**Why this is NOT WONTFIX:**
- Deprecation warnings are a critical part of NumPy's API evolution strategy
- Without runtime warnings, users won't know to update their code until NBitBase is removed
- The fix is straightforward and doesn't affect functionality

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Potential Arguments:**
- Could be seen as requesting "better" deprecation handling

**Why this is NOT a feature request:**
- The deprecation warning already exists in the code
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Potential Arguments:**
1. The documentation could mention that the warning might not appear
2. Could document that NBitBase is deprecated without relying on runtime warnings

**Why this is NOT just a documentation fix:**
- The code explicitly attempts to show a warning and fails
- The bug is in the implementation, not the documentation
- Documentation correctly describes the intended behavior

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The deprecation warning mechanism is implemented but fails to execute due to Python's attribute lookup order. The bug report:
1. Correctly identifies the problem
2. Provides working reproduction code
3. Explains the technical cause accurately
4. Offers a valid fix

The severity is appropriate (Medium) as this affects the deprecation process but doesn't break functionality. This is a textbook example of a valid bug report where intended behavior (showing deprecation warning) fails due to an implementation error.
