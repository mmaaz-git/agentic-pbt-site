DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. NumPy Documentation (numpy.random.Generator.wald):
   - States that mean and scale parameters must be > 0
   - Does NOT explicitly state the output range or support
   - Provides the PDF formula but doesn't specify the domain
   - References the distribution as "Inverse Gaussian"
   - No warnings about numerical stability with extreme parameters
   - No explicit statement that outputs must be positive

2. Mathematical Definition (Wikipedia - Inverse Gaussian):
   - Support is explicitly defined as (0, ∞)
   - The distribution is mathematically defined ONLY for x > 0
   - PDF is explicitly stated "for x > 0"
   - This is a fundamental mathematical property of the distribution
   - Used to model strictly positive quantities (e.g., time to reach threshold)

3. SciPy Documentation (scipy.stats.wald):
   - Defines the distribution for x ≥ 0
   - Support starts at 0 (inclusive)
   - Consistent with mathematical definition of positive support

4. Key Finding:
   While NumPy's documentation doesn't explicitly state that the Wald distribution
   must produce only positive values, this is a well-established mathematical fact
   about the Inverse Gaussian/Wald distribution. The distribution is fundamentally
   defined only for positive values, as evidenced by:
   - Mathematical literature universally defining support as (0, ∞)
   - The physical interpretation (time in Brownian motion) requiring positive values
   - Related implementations (SciPy) acknowledging positive support

5. Documentation Gap:
   NumPy's documentation could be clearer about:
   - The output support being (0, ∞)
   - Potential numerical issues with extreme parameters
   - The fact that outputs should always be positive

Conclusion:
The bug report is correct that negative values violate the mathematical definition
of the Wald distribution. This is not a case of unspecified behavior - the Wald
distribution is mathematically defined to have support (0, ∞), even if NumPy's
documentation doesn't explicitly state this fundamental property.
