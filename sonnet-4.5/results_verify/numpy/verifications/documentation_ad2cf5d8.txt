## Documentation Analysis

### Purpose of the Module
According to the source code comments (lines 14-21), numpy.f2py.symbolic is designed to:
- Analyze Fortran expressions to solve dimension specifications
- Implement a minimal symbolic engine for parsing expressions into a tree
- Handle arithmetic expressions with integers and operations (+, -, *, /, **)
- Support both Fortran and C expression parsing

### Key Points About Symbolic Nature
1. The module creates SYMBOLIC representations of expressions, not computed values
2. Line 19 explicitly states "Fortran / is Python //" but this refers to the semantic meaning, not the implementation
3. The expressions are meant to be parsed into expression trees for later analysis

### Documentation on Division by Zero
There is NO explicit documentation about how division by zero should be handled in:
- The `Expr.parse()` docstring (line 165: "Parse a Fortran expression to a Expr.")
- The `normalize()` function docstring (line 791: "Normalize Expr and apply basic evaluation methods.")
- Module-level documentation
- External NumPy documentation (searched but found no specific details)

### What normalize() Does
The normalize function (line 790-886) performs "basic evaluation methods" including:
- Simplifying terms and factors
- Handling special cases for division (lines 862-880)
- For integer division: uses GCD to simplify fractions (lines 866-868)
- For float division: performs actual division (line 870: `c1, c2 = c1 / c2, 1`)

### Critical Observation
The code at line 870 performs ACTUAL division (`c1 / c2`) rather than keeping it symbolic when one operand is a float. This is where the crash occurs. There's no documentation stating this is the intended behavior.

### Expected Behavior Based on Context
Given that:
1. This is a SYMBOLIC expression parser
2. Integer division by zero works correctly (creates symbolic `ArithOp.DIV(1, 0)`)
3. The purpose is to represent expressions as trees for later analysis
4. No documentation explicitly states division by zero should fail

The expected behavior would be to handle ALL division operations symbolically, regardless of operand types.
