BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Analyzing the bug report for classification into: BUG, INVALID, WONTFIX, FEATURE_REQUEST, or DOCUMENTATION_FIX

1. CASE FOR BUG (VALID):
✓ The function accepts inputs in the valid range [0,1] according to its contract
✓ The input 5e-324 is a valid float64 value in the range [0,1]
✓ The function returns 'nan%' which is not a valid formatted percentage string
✓ The docstring promises "formatted : list of strings" but 'nan%' is malformed
✓ This breaks the documented contract that the function returns formatted percentage strings
✓ The bug causes downstream issues for any code expecting valid percentage formatting
✓ The function's validation explicitly allows values in [0,1], so 5e-324 should work
✓ Other pandas functions that use format_percentiles would display 'nan%' to users

2. CASE FOR WONTFIX:
✗ Could argue that 5e-324 is an obscure denormalized number unlikely in practice
✗ However, pandas is a data analysis library that should handle edge cases gracefully
✗ The fix is straightforward (cap precision at reasonable value)
✗ This is not just a theoretical issue - it causes actual display problems

3. CASE FOR INVALID:
✗ The input IS within the documented valid range [0,1]
✗ The function explicitly validates inputs and 5e-324 passes validation
✗ The documentation doesn't say "normal floats only" or exclude subnormals
✗ The output 'nan%' clearly violates the promise of returning formatted strings

4. CASE FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
✗ This is not requesting new functionality
✗ The function should already handle all floats in [0,1] per its documentation
✗ Handling subnormal numbers properly is fixing existing functionality, not adding features

5. CASE FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
✗ The code behavior (returning 'nan%') is clearly incorrect
✗ We wouldn't want to document that 'nan%' is a valid output
✗ The documentation correctly describes what SHOULD happen
✗ The code is broken, not the documentation

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

a) Severity Assessment:
- This is a real bug that produces invalid output
- The output 'nan%' would be visible to end users in describe() results
- It affects data analysis workflows using extreme values

b) Mathematical Context:
- 5e-324 is the smallest positive normalized float64 value
- While extreme, it's a valid IEEE 754 number
- Data analysis tools should handle the full float64 range

c) User Impact:
- Users running describe() on data with extreme values would see 'nan%'
- This could cause confusion or break automated reporting
- The fix is simple and doesn't affect normal use cases

d) Precedent in Pandas:
- Pandas generally handles extreme values gracefully
- Other formatting functions don't produce 'nan' for valid inputs
- This is inconsistent with pandas' robustness standards

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
=================
This is a VALID BUG that should remain open and tagged as BUG.

Rationale:
1. The function accepts 5e-324 as valid input per its validation
2. The output 'nan%' violates the documented contract
3. The bug has real user impact in describe() output
4. The fix is straightforward and improves robustness
5. Pandas should handle the full float64 range correctly

This is NOT a WONTFIX because:
- The impact is real and visible to users
- Pandas is a data analysis library that should handle edge cases
- The fix doesn't complicate the code significantly

This is NOT INVALID because:
- The input is within the documented valid range
- The output clearly violates the expected format
- The function's own validation accepts the input
