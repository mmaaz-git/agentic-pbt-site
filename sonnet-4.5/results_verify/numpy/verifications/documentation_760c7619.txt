# Documentation Analysis

## Overview
I analyzed the numpy.f2py.symbolic module documentation and source code to understand the intended behavior of the Expr class's parse() and tostring() methods.

## Key Findings

### 1. Module Purpose
From the source file header (symbolic.py lines 1-26):
- The module implements "Fortran/C symbolic expressions"
- It's designed to analyze Fortran expressions and solve dimension specifications
- Implements a minimal symbolic engine for parsing expressions into expression trees
- Supports both Fortran and C expression parsing

### 2. Language Support
The module defines three languages (Language enum, lines 36-42):
- Python (0)
- Fortran (1)
- C (2)

### 3. Default Parameters
From the source code examination:
- `Expr.parse(s, language=Language.C)` - defaults to C language (line 164)
- `Expr.tostring(parent_precedence=Precedence.NONE, language=Language.Fortran)` - defaults to Fortran (line 277)
- `__str__()` calls `self.tostring()` without arguments, using Fortran default (line 274)

### 4. Documentation on Round-tripping
**Critical finding**: There is NO documentation that explicitly states or guarantees that round-tripping should work. Specifically:
- No docstring for parse() or tostring() mentions round-trip capability
- No comments in the code indicate round-trip is a design goal
- No tests in test_symbolic.py test for round-trip property
- The existing tests only verify that tostring() produces expected output, not that it can be parsed back

### 5. Parser Design Philosophy
From comments and code analysis:
- The parser is described as "lazy" - only arithmetic operations are resolved
- Non-arithmetic operations are treated as symbols
- Different languages have different syntaxes (e.g., Fortran uses '.eq.' while C uses '==')

### 6. Test Suite Evidence
From test_symbolic.py:
- Tests verify tostring() output for both Fortran and C languages separately
- No tests verify parse(str(expr)) == expr
- Tests explicitly show different output formats for different languages:
  - Fortran: `as_eq(x, y)` → `"x .eq. y"`
  - C: `as_eq(x, y)` → `"x == y"`

### 7. Web Search Results
- No official NumPy documentation found specifically documenting round-trip expectations
- The symbolic module appears to be an internal component for F2PY's Fortran-to-Python interface generation
- No external documentation specifies round-trip as a requirement

## Conclusion
The documentation does not establish round-tripping as a guaranteed property of the Expr class. The module is designed to support multiple language representations, and the default language mismatch between parse() and tostring() appears to be intentional to serve F2PY's primary use case of converting between C and Fortran representations. There is no evidence that `parse(str(expr)) == expr` was ever intended to work with default parameters.
