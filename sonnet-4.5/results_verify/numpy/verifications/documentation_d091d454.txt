## Documentation Analysis for numpy.random.uniform

I have reviewed the official NumPy documentation for numpy.random.uniform and found the following key information:

### Primary Documentation Statement
The function documentation states: "Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval `[low, high)` (includes low, but excludes high)."

This clearly establishes that the function should return values that are:
- Greater than or equal to `low` (inclusive)
- Strictly less than `high` (exclusive)

### Critical Exception Noted in Documentation
However, the documentation includes an important caveat: "The high limit may be included in the returned array of floats due to floating-point rounding in the equation `low + (high - low) * random_sample()`"

This is accompanied by an example showing how floating-point rounding can cause issues:
```python
x = np.float32(5*0.99999999)
x  # returns np.float32(5.0)
```

### Additional Documentation Points
1. The documentation recommends using the newer Generator API: "New code should use the `uniform` method of a `Generator` instance"

2. Edge case behavior is documented: When `high == low`, values of `low` will be returned

3. Undefined behavior warning: If `high < low`, the results are "officially undefined and may eventually raise an error"

### Interpretation
The documentation explicitly acknowledges that the upper bound exclusion contract can be violated due to floating-point rounding. The phrase "may be included" directly contradicts the primary specification of a half-open interval `[low, high)`.

This creates an inconsistency in the documentation itself:
- The main description promises strict exclusion of `high`
- The notes section admits this promise can be broken due to implementation details

The documentation does NOT specify:
- Any minimum range requirements
- Specific behavior with subnormal numbers
- Guarantees about precision with extremely small ranges
