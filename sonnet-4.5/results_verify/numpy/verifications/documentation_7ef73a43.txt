## Documentation Analysis

### numpy.char.capitalize Documentation
According to the official NumPy documentation:
- The function "Return[s] a copy of a with only the first character of each element capitalized"
- It explicitly states that it "calls str.capitalize() element-wise"
- No warnings or notes about truncation behavior
- No mention of how to handle cases where capitalization expands string length
- The module numpy.char is marked as legacy and will no longer receive updates

### Python's str.capitalize() Documentation
- Returns "a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased"
- Since Python 3.8, uses titlecase (not uppercase) for the first character
- No mention of length limitations since Python strings are dynamically sized

### NumPy String dtype Documentation
- Unicode strings use 'U' type code with a fixed character length (e.g., '<U4' for 4 characters)
- Documentation does not explicitly warn about truncation when operations exceed dtype capacity
- No mention of automatic dtype promotion for string operations that expand length

### Critical Documentation Gap
The documentation for numpy.char.capitalize claims it calls str.capitalize() element-wise, which creates an implicit contract that it should behave identically to Python's str.capitalize(). However:

1. The documentation does not warn that results may be truncated if the capitalized string exceeds the input dtype's capacity
2. There is no mention that certain Unicode characters can expand from 1 to multiple characters when capitalized
3. No guidance is provided on how to handle or prevent this truncation

### Comparison with Other numpy.char Functions
Some numpy.char functions like add() appear to dynamically size output dtypes appropriately, but capitalize() does not follow this pattern, and this inconsistency is not documented.
