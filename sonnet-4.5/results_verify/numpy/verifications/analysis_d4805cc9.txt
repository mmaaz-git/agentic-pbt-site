TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID - Why it might be invalid:
--------------------------------------------
- The function technically works as documented if we interpret "raises ValueError when the substring is not found" to mean "raises ValueError when the substring is not found in any element"
- It mimics Python's str.index() behavior which also raises ValueError
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise element-wise error handling

Why it's NOT invalid:
- The function returns type is documented as "ndarray - Output array of ints", which suggests it should return an array, not raise an exception for the entire operation
- NumPy functions are expected to work element-wise on arrays - this is a fundamental principle
- The behavior makes the function unusable for its primary use case (vectorized string operations)
- The find() function demonstrates that element-wise operation with -1 for "not found" is the established pattern

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be wontfix:
--------------------------------------------
- Changing the behavior could break existing code that relies on the ValueError being raised
- Users can use find() instead if they want element-wise behavior without exceptions
- The function technically works for the subset of cases where all elements contain the substring

Why it's NOT wontfix:
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects the core functionality of vectorized operations
- The current behavior severely limits the function's utility
- It's inconsistent with NumPy's design principles of vectorization
- The workaround (using find() and checking for -1) defeats the purpose of having index()

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be a documentation fix:
--------------------------------------------
- The documentation is ambiguous about how the function should behave with arrays
- It doesn't explicitly state that the function only works when ALL elements contain the substring
- Adding clarification to the docs would at least make the behavior clear

Why it's NOT just a documentation fix:
- The behavior itself is problematic and inconsistent with NumPy's design philosophy
- Even with perfect documentation, the function remains largely unusable for its intended purpose
- The return type "ndarray" suggests the function should successfully return an array

4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be a feature request:
--------------------------------------------
- Adding proper element-wise error handling could be seen as a new feature
- The current implementation might be considered "working as designed"
- Supporting mixed results arrays could be viewed as an enhancement

Why it's NOT a feature request:
- Vectorized operations are not a "feature" in NumPy - they're the fundamental design principle
- The function already claims to return an ndarray, not raise an exception
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities

5. BUG - Why it IS a bug:
--------------------------------------------
- The function violates NumPy's core principle of element-wise operations on arrays
- The documentation states it returns "ndarray - Output array of ints" but it raises an exception instead
- It's inconsistent with the behavior of find()/rfind() which handle mixed results correctly
- The function is essentially unusable for vectorized operations with real-world data
- The behavior is surprising and counterintuitive for NumPy users
- The phrase "Like `find`, but raises ValueError" suggests similar behavior with different error handling, not completely different vectorization behavior

Why it might NOT be a bug:
- The documentation could be interpreted to support the current behavior
- It technically follows Python's str.index() pattern of raising ValueError

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
-----------------
This is a BUG. The function fails to provide proper vectorized operation support, which is fundamental to NumPy's design. While the documentation is ambiguous, the function's behavior violates the reasonable expectation that NumPy functions operate element-wise on arrays. The fact that it claims to return an "ndarray" but instead raises an exception for mixed-result arrays strongly indicates this is incorrect behavior rather than a documentation issue or missing feature.

The bug significantly impacts the usability of the function for its intended purpose - vectorized string operations. Users cannot reliably use numpy.strings.index() on real-world data where some elements may not contain the search substring, forcing them to use find() and manually check for -1 values, which defeats the purpose of having a separate index() function.
