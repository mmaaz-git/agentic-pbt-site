DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## NumPy Mean Documentation Review

I have reviewed the official numpy.mean documentation, both from the online documentation and the built-in docstring.

### What the Documentation Says

1. **Purpose**: "Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis."

2. **Mathematical Definition**: "The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided by the number of elements."

3. **Floating-Point Accuracy Warning**:
   The documentation explicitly states:
   - "Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same precision the input has."
   - "Depending on the input data, this can cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32"
   - "Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the dtype keyword can alleviate this issue"

4. **Default Behavior**:
   - For integer inputs: Uses float64 intermediate and return values
   - For floating-point inputs: Uses the same precision as the input
   - For float16: Uses float32 intermediates for extra precision

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say

The documentation does NOT:
1. Guarantee that min(X) <= mean(X) <= max(X) will always hold
2. Warn that fundamental mathematical properties might be violated
3. Specify what level of numerical accuracy to expect
4. Mention that identical values in an array might produce a mean different from those values
5. Discuss specific numerical stability algorithms used (e.g., pairwise summation, Kahan summation)
6. Warn about issues with very small (denormalized) or very large numbers

### Documentation Accuracy Assessment

The documentation is technically accurate but incomplete:
- It correctly states that floating-point computation can be inaccurate
- It provides a workaround (using higher precision dtype)
- However, it does not adequately warn users that basic mathematical invariants can be violated

### Comparison with Other Functions

The numpy.average function has similar documentation and likely suffers from the same issue, as it also computes weighted averages using sum operations.

### Industry Standards

Most statistical libraries and mathematical references assume that mean values respect the min/max bounds as a fundamental property. This is a reasonable expectation for users, even if not explicitly documented.
