## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug) - Arguments For:
1. **Clear Intent to Deprecate**: The code explicitly contains deprecation warning logic in __getattr__
2. **Documentation Confirms Deprecation**: Official docs and release notes state NBitBase is deprecated since 2.3
3. **Code Exists But Doesn't Execute**: The deprecation warning code is present but unreachable
4. **User Impact**: Users upgrading to NumPy 2.3+ won't be warned about deprecated API usage
5. **Simple Fix Available**: The proposed fix is straightforward and would resolve the issue
6. **Breaks Deprecation Contract**: The deprecation process relies on warnings to notify users before removal

### INVALID - Arguments Against:
1. NBitBase still works functionally (users can access it)
2. The deprecation is documented in release notes and documentation
3. Some might argue that documentation alone is sufficient notice
(Weak arguments - the presence of warning code indicates clear intent)

### WONTFIX - Arguments Against:
1. This is not a trivial issue - deprecation warnings are important for API migration
2. The bug affects user-facing behavior that impacts code maintenance
3. NBitBase is a public API, not an internal implementation detail
(This is clearly not WONTFIX material)

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments Against:
1. The documentation correctly states NBitBase is deprecated
2. The issue is not with documentation accuracy but with implementation
3. The code behavior doesn't match the documented intent (warning should trigger)
(This is an implementation bug, not a documentation issue)

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments Against:
1. This isn't requesting new functionality
2. The deprecation warning code already exists
3. This is about fixing existing, non-functional code
(Clearly not a feature request)

### Analysis Summary:
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The NumPy maintainers wrote deprecation warning code with clear intent to notify users, but due to the module import structure, this code is never executed. This violates the deprecation contract where users should receive runtime warnings about deprecated APIs. The bug report correctly identifies both the problem and provides a valid fix. The issue impacts the deprecation process, which is crucial for API evolution and user migration paths.
