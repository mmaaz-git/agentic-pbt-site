DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Sources Reviewed:
------------------------------
1. numpy.fft.hfft docstring (from help() and online docs)
2. numpy.fft.ihfft docstring (from help() and online docs)
3. Notes sections of both functions

Key Documentation Claims:
------------------------

1. ROUND-TRIP PROPERTIES (from both hfft and ihfft docs):
   - Even: "ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2)) == a, within roundoff error"
   - Odd: "ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1)) == a, within roundoff error"

2. CRITICAL NOTE IN hfft DOCUMENTATION:
   From the Notes section: "By default, hfft assumes an even output length which
   puts the last entry at the Nyquist frequency; aliasing with its symmetric
   counterpart. By Hermitian symmetry, the value is thus treated as purely real.
   To avoid losing information, the shape of the full signal **must** be given."

3. CONTRADICTION IDENTIFIED:
   - The documentation states the even case works "within roundoff error"
   - But it also states the Nyquist frequency is "treated as purely real"
   - These two statements are contradictory when the input has imaginary components

Documentation Assessment:
------------------------

The documentation contains a FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION:

1. The round-trip formula claims the even case preserves the input "within roundoff error"
2. The Notes section explains that for even-length outputs, the Nyquist frequency
   component is "treated as purely real," which necessarily loses the imaginary part
3. This information loss is NOT "roundoff error" - it's a systematic discarding of data

The phrase "To avoid losing information, the shape of the full signal **must** be given"
seems to suggest using the odd case (2*len(a) - 1) to preserve all information, but this
is not explicitly stated.

Examples in Documentation:
-------------------------
The examples provided in the documentation cleverly avoid this issue:
- They use real-valued Hermitian arrays (like [1, 2, 3]) where the bug doesn't manifest
- Or they show one-way transforms, not round-trips

Conclusion:
----------
The documentation is MISLEADING. It promises a round-trip property for the even case
that cannot be fulfilled when the input has imaginary components in the last element.
The Notes section actually explains why this fails, but the main documentation still
incorrectly claims it works "within roundoff error."
