DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR NBITBASE DEPRECATION
================================================

Official Documentation Found:
-----------------------------

1. NumPy Stable Documentation (numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html):
   - NBitBase is officially DEPRECATED since version 2.3
   - Clear deprecation notice: "Deprecated since version 2.3: Use @typing.overload or
     a TypeVar with a scalar-type as upper bound, instead."
   - Documentation shows NBitBase as part of the public API with a deprecation marker

2. NumPy 2.3.0 Release Notes:
   - Confirms NBitBase was deprecated in NumPy 2.3.0
   - Provides migration path: use typing.overload instead
   - Explains the reason: NBitBase became problematic after NumPy 2.2.0 changes
   - Links to pull request gh-28884 implementing the deprecation

3. Source Code Comments:
   - Line 176 in numpy/typing/__init__.py: "# Deprecated in NumPy 2.3, 2025-05-01"
   - The __getattr__ implementation (lines 172-184) contains the deprecation message
   - Message states: "deprecated in NumPy 2.3" and "will be removed from numpy.typing"

Documentation Contract:
-----------------------
The documentation establishes a clear contract:
1. NBitBase is deprecated as of NumPy 2.3
2. Users should receive a DeprecationWarning when accessing it
3. The attribute will be removed in a future version (target: 2025-05-01)
4. Users should migrate to @typing.overload or TypeVar alternatives

Bug Validity:
-------------
The bug report correctly identifies that this documented contract is violated:
- The deprecation warning is INTENDED to be shown (per code and documentation)
- The warning mechanism exists but is never triggered
- Users are NOT being warned as the documentation promises
- This breaks the deprecation timeline and user migration path

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation clearly establishes that NBitBase should emit a deprecation warning
when accessed. The current implementation fails to fulfill this documented behavior,
making this a valid bug report rather than undefined behavior or a documentation issue.
