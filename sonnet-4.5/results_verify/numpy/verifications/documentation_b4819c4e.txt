DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR numpy.bmat

## Official Documentation Review

The official numpy.bmat documentation states:

Parameters:
- obj: Input data. If a string, variables in the current scope may be referenced by name.
- ldict: dict, optional - A dictionary that replaces local operands in current frame.
  **Ignored if `obj` is not a string or `gdict` is None.**
- gdict: dict, optional - A dictionary that replaces global operands in current frame.
  **Ignored if `obj` is not a string.**

## Key Documentation Points

1. The documentation clearly states that ldict is "optional" with a default value of None.

2. The documentation states ldict is "Ignored if `obj` is not a string or `gdict` is None."
   - This implies that when gdict IS provided (not None), ldict should be used
   - But it doesn't explicitly state what happens when gdict is provided but ldict is None

3. The documentation does NOT explicitly require that ldict must be provided when gdict is provided.

4. The examples in the documentation show usage like `np.bmat('A,B; C,D')` without any explicit ldict or gdict parameters, relying on the automatic frame lookup.

## Documentation Ambiguity

The documentation is ambiguous about what should happen when:
- obj is a string
- gdict is provided (not None)
- ldict is None (default)

The documentation says ldict is "ignored" in certain cases, but doesn't explicitly state that ldict MUST be provided when gdict is provided. A reasonable interpretation would be that providing gdict without ldict should work, with the function only looking up variables in gdict.

## Source Code Review

Looking at the actual implementation:
- Line 1104-1105: When gdict is provided, the code sets `loc_dict = ldict` directly
- Line 1030: The _from_string function tries `thismat = ldict[col]` without checking if ldict is None first
- This causes a TypeError when ldict is None

The implementation clearly doesn't handle the case where gdict is provided but ldict is None (the default).
