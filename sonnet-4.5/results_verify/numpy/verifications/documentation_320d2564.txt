DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

I have thoroughly reviewed the NumPy documentation for numpy.char.array(), numpy.char.asarray(), and the chararray class.

KEY FINDINGS:

1. numpy.char.array() documentation (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.char.array.html):
   - EXPLICITLY STATES: "Automatic whitespace removal when indexing values"
   - EXPLICITLY STATES: "Automatic whitespace removal when comparing values"
   - This is documented as an intentional feature of the function

2. numpy.char.asarray() documentation (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.char.asarray.html):
   - EXPLICITLY STATES: "Automatically removes whitespace when indexing values"
   - EXPLICITLY STATES: "Automatically removes whitespace when comparing values"
   - This behavior is documented identically to numpy.char.array()

3. numpy.char.chararray class documentation (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.char.chararray.html):
   - Confirms this is intentional design: "Values automatically have whitespace removed when indexed"
   - States this class exists "primarily for backwards compatibility with Numarray"
   - WARNS: "Starting from numpy 1.4, if one needs arrays of strings, it is recommended to use arrays of object_, bytes_ or str_, and use the free functions in the numpy.char module for fast vectorized string operations"
   - Explicitly marks this as LEGACY functionality not recommended for new code

4. Purpose and Context:
   - The chararray class was designed for Numarray compatibility
   - The whitespace stripping is an intentional feature, not a bug
   - This behavior is clearly documented in all three relevant documentation pages
   - NumPy explicitly recommends NOT using these functions for new code

5. Documentation Clarity:
   - The documentation does mention "whitespace removal" but doesn't clearly specify:
     * That only TRAILING whitespace is removed (not all whitespace)
     * The exact definition of "whitespace" (includes \r, \n, \t, \x00, spaces)
     * That strings consisting entirely of whitespace become empty strings
   - The actual behavior is more nuanced than the documentation suggests

CONCLUSION:
The whitespace stripping behavior is INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED and EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED. This is not undocumented behavior - it is a documented feature of these legacy functions. The bug report's claim that "This behavior is not documented in the docstring" is incorrect - the behavior IS documented, though the documentation could be more precise about the exact stripping rules.
