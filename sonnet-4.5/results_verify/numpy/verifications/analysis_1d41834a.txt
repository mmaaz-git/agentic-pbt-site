# Triage Analysis

## BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments for:**
- The logic error is indisputable: `order` is always truthy ('C' or 'F'), making the condition always False
- Dead code exists at line 167 that can never be executed
- The code clearly intended to copy non-contiguous arrays (based on the structure), but fails to do so
- This is a clear programming error, not a design choice
- The fix is straightforward and obvious: remove `order` from the boolean expression

**Arguments against:**
- The code still functions without errors (no crashes or exceptions)
- Non-contiguous matrices work, just not as originally intended

**Verdict:** Strong case for BUG

## WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- The bug has likely existed for a long time without causing major issues
- Non-contiguous matrices still work, they just remain non-contiguous
- The impact is minimal - performance might be slightly affected but functionality is preserved
- numpy.matrix is deprecated in favor of regular arrays

**Arguments against:**
- Dead code is a clear code quality issue
- The fix is trivial and low-risk
- The intent of the code is clear, it's just incorrectly implemented

**Verdict:** Possible but weak case

## INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- None - the logic error is mathematically provable

**Arguments against:**
- The bug report correctly identifies dead code
- The analysis is accurate
- The reproduction is valid

**Verdict:** Not INVALID

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- The documentation doesn't specify whether matrices should be contiguous
- Could argue the code works as (accidentally) designed

**Arguments against:**
- This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue
- The dead code serves no purpose
- The intent of the code is obvious from context

**Verdict:** Not appropriate

## FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Could frame it as "please make matrices handle non-contiguous arrays better"

**Arguments against:**
- This is fixing broken existing code, not adding new functionality
- The feature (copying non-contiguous arrays) was already attempted but implemented incorrectly

**Verdict:** Not appropriate

## Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The logic error is undeniable - using `order or arr.flags.contiguous` when `order` is always truthy makes the condition always False, rendering line 167 as dead code. The intent of the code is clear (to copy non-contiguous arrays to make them contiguous), but the implementation is broken due to a simple logic error. This is a textbook example of a programming bug that should be fixed.
