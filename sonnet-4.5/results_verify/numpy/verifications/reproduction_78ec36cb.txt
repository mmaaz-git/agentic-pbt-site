## Bug Reproduction Results

### Summary
The bug report has been successfully reproduced. The reported behavior is confirmed.

### Key Findings

1. **Primary Issue Confirmed**: For the matrix `[[0.0, 1.52474291e-300], [1.0, 1.0]]`, numpy.linalg.eig returns eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs that violate the fundamental eigenvalue equation with an error magnitude of 1.0.

2. **Specific Results**:
   - For eigenvalue λ=0, eigenvector v=[1, 0]
   - A @ v = [0, 1] but λ * v = [0, 0]
   - Error magnitude: ||A @ v - λ * v|| = 1.0
   - This is NOT a small numerical precision issue

3. **Additional Cases Confirmed**:
   - Matrix with 1e-100: Same 1.0 error magnitude
   - Matrix with 1e-200: Same 1.0 error magnitude
   - Matrix with exact zeros: Works correctly (0.0 error)

4. **Pattern Identified**: The issue occurs specifically when:
   - Matrix contains very small but non-zero values (< ~1e-16)
   - These values are treated as zero during eigenvalue computation
   - But are NOT zero when computing A @ v for verification

5. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The characteristic polynomial for the test matrix is λ² - λ + (-1.52474291e-300) ≈ λ² - λ
   - This gives eigenvalues λ=0 and λ=1
   - For λ=0, the eigenvector should satisfy Av = 0
   - The computed eigenvector v=[1, 0] gives Av = [0, 1] ≠ [0, 0]

6. **Root Cause**: The algorithm appears to:
   - Round very small values to zero when computing eigenvalues
   - Use the original (non-zero) values when verifying A @ v
   - This inconsistency causes the large error

7. **Condition Number**: The test matrix has infinite condition number, indicating severe ill-conditioning.

### Technical Details

The bug is NOT about:
- Small rounding errors or tolerance issues
- Expected numerical precision limitations
- Edge cases that are ambiguous

The bug IS about:
- Complete violation of the eigenvalue equation (100% error)
- Inconsistent treatment of denormalized/tiny floating point values
- Returning mathematically incorrect results

### Comparison with Documentation

The documentation states that eigenvectors should satisfy `A @ eigenvectors[:,i] = eigenvalues[i] * eigenvectors[:,i]`. With an error of 1.0, this equation is fundamentally violated, not just within numerical tolerance.
