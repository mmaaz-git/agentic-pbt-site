## Analysis of Bug Report Categorization

### Consideration for BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Arguments For:**
1. **Silent Data Loss**: The function silently loses data without any warning or error. Values that exist in the input arrays disappear in the output.
2. **Violates Fundamental Property**: Concatenation should preserve all input data. The property `concat([a, b]).to_dense() == np.concatenate([a.to_dense(), b.to_dense()])` is a reasonable invariant that is violated.
3. **No Documentation**: There is no documentation warning users about this behavior or stating it's intentional.
4. **Reproducible**: The bug is 100% reproducible with clear test cases.
5. **High Impact**: This affects data integrity, which is critical for a data analysis library like pandas.
6. **User Expectation**: Users reasonably expect concatenation to preserve their data.

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments Against (weak):**
1. Could argue it's an internal method (_concat_same_type with leading underscore), but it's still used by public APIs.
2. Could argue users shouldn't mix fill values, but there's no documentation stating this limitation.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments Against:**
1. This is not a trivial issue - it causes data loss.
2. It's not an obscure edge case - different fill values are a normal use case.
3. The fix is straightforward and addresses a fundamental correctness issue.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments Against:**
1. This is not asking for new functionality - concatenation already exists.
2. The current behavior loses data, which is a bug not a missing feature.
3. Preserving data during concatenation is expected behavior, not an enhancement.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments Against:**
1. While documentation could be added to warn about this, the underlying behavior is still wrong.
2. Documenting data loss doesn't make it acceptable.
3. The code behavior itself needs to be fixed, not just documented.

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function silently loses user data during a standard operation (concatenation) without any documentation or warning. The behavior violates reasonable expectations about data preservation and the fundamental property of concatenation. The fact that it's an internal method doesn't excuse data loss, especially when it's used by public APIs. The bug is reproducible, high-impact, and has a clear fix.
