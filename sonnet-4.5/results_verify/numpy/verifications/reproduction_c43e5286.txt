# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The function `numpy.rec.find_duplicate` fails to detect duplicate NaN values in a list.

## Tests Performed

### 1. Property-Based Test
The hypothesis test provided in the bug report was executed and confirmed the issue. When given a list containing multiple NaN values, the function fails to include NaN in the result list of duplicated elements.

### 2. Simple Test Case
Input: `[float('nan'), float('nan'), 1.0, 1.0]`
Expected Result: A list containing both NaN and 1.0 as duplicated elements (length 2)
Actual Result: `[1.0]` (length 1, missing NaN)

## Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs because `numpy.rec.find_duplicate` uses Python's `Counter` class internally. Counter relies on hashing and equality comparisons. Since NaN values have a special property where `nan != nan` always returns False (per IEEE 754 standard), and different NaN objects created separately have different identities, Counter treats them as distinct items.

### Counter Behavior with NaN
- When different NaN objects are created (e.g., `float('nan')` called twice), Counter treats them as separate keys
- Example: `Counter([float('nan'), float('nan'), 1.0, 1.0])` results in `{nan: 1, nan: 1, 1.0: 2}`
- Each NaN gets counted only once, so neither appears as a duplicate

### Implementation Details
The function implementation (lines 48-54 of numpy/_core/records.py):
```python
def find_duplicate(list):
    """Find duplication in a list, return a list of duplicated elements"""
    return [
        item
        for item, counts in Counter(list).items()
        if counts > 1
    ]
```

This implementation directly uses Counter without any special handling for NaN values.

## Verification
The bug is consistently reproducible and affects any list containing multiple NaN values. The function correctly identifies other duplicates (like the duplicate 1.0 values) but fails specifically for NaN values.
