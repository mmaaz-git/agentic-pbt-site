# Bug Report: NumPy String Array - Trailing Null Character Truncation

**Target**: `numpy.array` (string dtype handling)
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Summary

NumPy silently truncates trailing null characters (`\x00`) when creating string arrays, causing data corruption. Strings ending with null characters lose those trailing nulls, while null characters in the middle of strings are preserved.

## Property-Based Test

```python
import numpy as np
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings


@given(st.text(min_size=1, max_size=50))
@settings(max_examples=1000)
def test_numpy_array_preserves_strings(s):
    arr = np.array([s])
    assert arr[0] == s, f"np.array should preserve all characters in strings"
```

**Failing input**: `'\x00'`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array(['\x00'])
assert arr[0] == ''
assert arr[0] != '\x00'

arr2 = np.array(['hello\x00'])
assert arr2[0] == 'hello'
assert arr2[0] != 'hello\x00'

arr3 = np.array(['a\x00b'])
assert arr3[0] == 'a\x00b'
```

## Why This Is A Bug

NumPy arrays should preserve all characters in strings, including null characters. The null character (`\x00`, Unicode U+0000) is a valid Unicode code point and should be treated like any other character. This behavior differs from Python's native string handling and causes silent data corruption.

The bug specifically affects:
- Standalone null characters: `'\x00'` becomes `''`
- Trailing nulls: `'hello\x00'` becomes `'hello'`
- Multiple trailing nulls: `'test\x00\x00'` becomes `'test'`

Null characters in the middle of strings are correctly preserved: `'a\x00b'` remains `'a\x00b'`.

This suggests NumPy is treating Unicode strings as C-strings, where null bytes terminate the string, despite Python Unicode strings supporting embedded nulls.

## Fix

The root cause is likely in NumPy's C implementation of string handling. NumPy should either:
1. Preserve trailing null characters to match Python's string behavior
2. Document this limitation and raise a warning when nulls are truncated
3. Use a different approach that doesn't rely on C-string semantics

A complete fix would require examining NumPy's Unicode string implementation in C, but the issue appears to be in how NumPy converts Python strings to its internal representation, treating `\x00` as a string terminator rather than a valid character.
