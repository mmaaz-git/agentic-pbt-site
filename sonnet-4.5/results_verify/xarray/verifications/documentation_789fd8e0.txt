DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED
----------------------
1. PandasIndex.roll docstring (from help()):
   - States: "Roll this index by an offset along one or more dimensions"
   - Returns: "A new index with rolled data"
   - No mention of restrictions on empty indexes
   - No indication that empty indexes are unsupported

2. Base class Index.roll docstring:
   - Similar description to PandasIndex
   - No mention of empty index handling
   - States method can be re-implemented in subclasses

3. xarray Dataset.roll online documentation:
   - Describes rolling as treating dimensions as "periodic"
   - Shows examples with non-empty datasets
   - Does NOT specify behavior for empty datasets
   - Does NOT state that empty datasets/indexes are unsupported

DOCUMENTATION GAPS
------------------
The documentation does not:
- Specify that empty indexes are unsupported
- Mention any restrictions on minimum index size
- Provide guidance on edge case handling
- Include examples with empty data

IMPLIED CONTRACT
----------------
Based on the documentation:
1. The method should "roll this index by an offset" - no size restrictions mentioned
2. It should return "a new index with rolled data" - implies it should always return an index
3. The operation treats dimensions as "periodic" - empty sequences can be considered trivially periodic

CONSISTENCY WITH ECOSYSTEM
---------------------------
Related operations in the Python data ecosystem handle empty inputs:
- numpy.roll([]) returns []
- pandas.Series([]).shift() returns empty Series
- These set precedent that empty inputs should be handled gracefully

CONCLUSION
----------
The documentation does not indicate that empty indexes are unsupported. The crash violates the implicit contract that the method should handle all valid PandasIndex objects. Since an empty PandasIndex can be created without error, it should be considered a valid input to all its methods unless explicitly documented otherwise.
