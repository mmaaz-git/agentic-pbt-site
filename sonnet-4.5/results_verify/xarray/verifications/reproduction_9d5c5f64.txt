BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

Successfully reproduced the bug as described in the bug report.

## Test Results

### Direct Reproduction Tests

1. **timestamp_as_unit with year=1000**:
   - Created a valid pd.Timestamp(year=1000, month=1, day=1) with unit='us'
   - Calling timestamp_as_unit(ts, 'ns') raises OutOfBoundsDatetime
   - Error message: "Cannot cast 1000-01-01 00:00:00 to unit='ns' without overflow."

2. **default_precision_timestamp with year=1000**:
   - Calling default_precision_timestamp(year=1000, month=1, day=1) raises OutOfBoundsDatetime
   - Error message: "Cannot cast 1000-01-01 00:00:00 to unit='ns' without overflow."

### Hypothesis Test Results

Both property-based tests failed immediately:
- test_timestamp_as_unit_preserves_value failed on first example (year=1)
- test_default_precision_timestamp_returns_ns failed on first example (year=1)

### Range Testing

Tested various years to confirm the nanosecond range limitation:
- Years 1-1677: Both functions crash with OutOfBoundsDatetime
- Years 1678-2262: Both functions work correctly
- Years 2263-9999: Both functions crash with OutOfBoundsDatetime

This confirms the documented pandas nanosecond range of approximately 1678-2262.

### Pandas Behavior

Tested pandas directly (version 2.3.2):
- pd.Timestamp can create timestamps for all years (1-9999)
- Timestamps outside ns range are stored with 'us' precision by default
- The as_unit() method exists and works for 's', 'ms', 'us' units
- The as_unit('ns') method correctly raises OutOfBoundsDatetime for dates outside ns range

## Effect of the Bug

The bug causes xarray's compatibility functions to crash on valid timestamps that pandas can handle. The functions:

1. Don't handle the OutOfBoundsDatetime exception that pandas raises
2. Don't provide any fallback behavior when conversion to 'ns' fails
3. Force all timestamps to 'ns' precision even when unnecessary (default_precision_timestamp)

This breaks xarray functionality for historical dates (before 1678) and far-future dates (after 2262), even though pandas itself supports these dates with different time units.
