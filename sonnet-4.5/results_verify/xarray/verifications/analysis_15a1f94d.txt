## Triage Analysis

### Considerations for INVALID
Arguments against INVALID:
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The function violates a critical invariant that's enforced elsewhere in the code
- The align_nd_chunks function explicitly checks that sum(chunks) == size
- The error message in align_nd_chunks states "This inconsistency should never occur at this stage"

Could this be INVALID? **NO** - The bug clearly exists and violates documented invariants.

### Considerations for WONTFIX
Arguments for WONTFIX:
- Could argue that size < chunk_size is an edge case that might not occur in practice
- Zarr chunks are typically smaller than dimension sizes for efficiency

Arguments against WONTFIX:
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a simple mathematical boundary condition
- The bug causes data corruption (chunks covering more than the actual data)
- It breaks a fundamental invariant that other parts of the code depend on
- The fix is simple and doesn't impact normal operation

Could this be WONTFIX? **NO** - This is a real bug that can cause data corruption, not a trivial issue.

### Considerations for FEATURE_REQUEST
Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- None - the function already exists and should work correctly

Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
- The expected behavior (chunks summing to size) is already enforced elsewhere

Could this be FEATURE_REQUEST? **NO** - This is a bug in existing functionality.

### Considerations for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The function has no docstring
- One could argue the documentation should specify behavior for size < chunk_size

Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code is broken, not just the documentation
- The invariant (sum(chunks) == size) is enforced in align_nd_chunks with an error
- Even without documentation, the mathematical property of partitioning is fundamental
- The bug causes actual failures in the system (ValueError in align_nd_chunks)

Could this be DOCUMENTATION_FIX? **NO** - The code itself is incorrect and causes errors.

### Considerations for BUG
Arguments for BUG:
- The function returns mathematically incorrect results (sum(chunks) > size)
- It violates an invariant enforced by align_nd_chunks
- The error message states this "should never occur"
- It causes downstream errors in the xarray/zarr pipeline
- The bug is reproducible and deterministic
- It affects a boundary condition (size < chunk_size) that should be handled correctly
- The proposed fix is reasonable and maintains backward compatibility for correct cases

Arguments against BUG:
- None substantial

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function fails to maintain the fundamental invariant that chunks must partition the input size exactly. When size < chunk_size, it returns chunks whose sum exceeds the input size, which:
1. Violates mathematical correctness
2. Causes ValueError in align_nd_chunks
3. Could lead to data corruption if not caught
4. Has a clear, simple fix that maintains all existing correct behavior
