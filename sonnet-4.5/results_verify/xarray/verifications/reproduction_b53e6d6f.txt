## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Results
The Hypothesis property-based test failed as expected with a FlakyFailure, showing that when index=0, the test fails because the cache returns the mutated value "MUTATED" instead of the original SVG content. The error message confirms:
```
AssertionError: Cache returned mutated result. Expected original content, got: MUTATED
```

### Manual Reproduction Results
The manual test clearly demonstrates the bug:
1. First call to `_load_static_files()` returns a list containing SVG and CSS content
2. The returned type is `<class 'list'>` (mutable)
3. When we mutate the first element by setting `result1[0] = "MUTATED_CONTENT"`
4. The second call to `_load_static_files()` returns the mutated content "MUTATED_CONTENT" instead of the original SVG

### Source Code Analysis
Looking at the actual implementation in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/xarray_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray/core/formatting_html.py`:

```python
@lru_cache(None)
def _load_static_files():
    """Lazily load the resource files into memory the first time they are needed"""
    return [
        files(package).joinpath(resource).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        for package, resource in STATIC_FILES
    ]
```

The function:
1. Uses `@lru_cache(None)` decorator to cache the result indefinitely
2. Returns a list (mutable data structure)
3. The list contains static SVG and CSS content loaded from resource files

### The Bug
The bug is real and occurs because:
1. The `@lru_cache` decorator caches the actual list object reference
2. When the function returns this cached list, it returns the same mutable list object
3. Any modifications to this returned list directly mutate the cached object
4. All subsequent calls receive the mutated cached list

### Impact
This bug could cause serious issues in production:
- HTML rendering could fail if the static resources are corrupted
- Different parts of the application could see inconsistent static content
- Hard-to-debug issues since mutation could happen anywhere in the codebase
- The bug violates the principle that cached resources should be immutable

The bug is confirmed and reproducible with both the property-based test and manual reproduction code.
