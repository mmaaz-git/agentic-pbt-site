## Documentation Analysis

### Function Purpose
The `result_type` function in `xarray.compat.array_api_compat` is a compatibility wrapper designed to provide consistent behavior across different array libraries (numpy, cupy, etc.) for determining the result dtype of operations on arrays and scalars.

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **Internal Comments**: The code includes a comment explaining that `_future_array_api_result_type` is a "fallback implementation for `xp.result_type` with python scalars" that will be removed once the Array API standard (issue #805) includes scalar support.

2. **Weak Scalar Types Definition**: The function `is_weak_scalar_type` explicitly defines what constitutes a weak scalar type:
   ```python
   def is_weak_scalar_type(t):
       return isinstance(t, bool | int | float | complex | str | bytes)
   ```
   This clearly includes `str` and `bytes` as supported weak scalar types.

3. **Implementation Support**: The `_future_array_api_result_type` function explicitly maps string and bytes types:
   ```python
   possible_dtypes = {
       complex: "complex64",
       float: "float32",
       int: "int8",
       bool: "bool",
       str: "str",      # Explicit string support
       bytes: "bytes",  # Explicit bytes support
   }
   ```

4. **NumPy's result_type**: NumPy's documentation shows it accepts "arrays and dtypes" but does NOT mention support for string or bytes scalars. Testing confirms numpy.result_type raises TypeError for string/bytes inputs.

5. **No External Documentation**: There is no user-facing documentation or docstring for the `result_type` function in array_api_compat.py that would specify expected behavior.

### Documentation Gap
The code intentionally supports string and bytes as weak scalar types, has explicit handling for them in `_future_array_api_result_type`, but the routing logic in `result_type` prevents this support from working when using numpy. This appears to be an implementation oversight rather than a documentation issue, since:

1. The code explicitly defines strings/bytes as weak scalar types
2. The code has explicit handling for these types
3. The bug prevents this intended functionality from working

The lack of user-facing documentation means we must rely on the implementation's clear intent, which is to support string and bytes scalars as weak scalar types.
