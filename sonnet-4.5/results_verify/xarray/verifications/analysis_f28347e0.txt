# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Considerations for Each Category

### BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
**Why it could be a BUG:**
- **Clear violation of Python's hash contract:** Python's documentation explicitly states that hash values must remain constant during an object's lifetime
- **Reproducible with real impact:** The bug is easily reproducible and causes actual runtime failures (objects get lost in dictionaries)
- **Violates fundamental Python behavior:** This isn't an edge case - it breaks basic dictionary/set operations
- **No documentation suggests this is intentional:** Nothing in xarray's documentation indicates this changing hash behavior is expected
- **The fix is straightforward:** The proposed fix (hashing immutable attributes instead of mutable _value) is correct and simple
- **Security/reliability concern:** Code relying on these objects as dictionary keys could fail unpredictably in production

### INVALID (Incorrect report, code works as intended)
**Why it could be INVALID:**
- Could argue the class was never intended to be used as a dictionary key (but nothing documents this restriction)
- The class name suggests it's for internal use in deprecation handling (but it's exposed in public API)
- **Verdict: UNLIKELY** - There's no evidence this behavior is intentional

### WONTFIX (Trivial or unimportant issue)
**Why it could be WONTFIX:**
- These objects might rarely be used as dictionary keys in practice
- It's an internal deprecation helper, not a core feature
- **Verdict: UNLIKELY** - This violates a fundamental Python contract, not a minor issue

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation needs updating)
**Why it could be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could document that these objects shouldn't be used as dictionary keys
- Could add warnings about the changing hash behavior
- **Verdict: POSSIBLE BUT INSUFFICIENT** - While documentation could help, the underlying code violates Python's data model

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality requested)
**Why it could be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting stable hashing could be seen as a new feature
- **Verdict: UNLIKELY** - This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

## Analysis Summary

This is a **clear violation of Python's documented hash contract**. The bug:
1. Is easily reproducible
2. Has real-world impact (objects disappear from dictionaries)
3. Violates fundamental Python behavior that all Python developers expect
4. Has a simple, correct fix proposed
5. Is not documented as intentional behavior

The fact that `CombineKwargDefault` implements both `__eq__` (based on mutable state) and `__hash__` (also based on that same mutable state) is fundamentally incorrect according to Python's data model.

## Recommendation
This should be categorized as **BUG**. It's a legitimate violation of Python's hash contract that can cause runtime failures. The proposed fix (hashing the immutable constructor parameters instead of the mutable _value) is correct and should be implemented.
