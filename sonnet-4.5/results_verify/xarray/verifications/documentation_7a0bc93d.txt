## Documentation Analysis for decimal_encoder

### Function Documentation
The `decimal_encoder` function in `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/pydantic_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/deprecated/json.py` has the following docstring (lines 34-46):

```
Encodes a Decimal as int of there's no exponent, otherwise float.

This is useful when we use ConstrainedDecimal to represent Numeric(x,0)
where a integer (but not int typed) is used. Encoding this as a float
results in failed round-tripping between encode and parse.
Our Id type is a prime example of this.

>>> decimal_encoder(Decimal("1.0"))
1.0

>>> decimal_encoder(Decimal("1"))
1
```

### Key Points from Documentation

1. **Purpose**: The function is designed to encode Decimals as integers when there's "no exponent", otherwise as floats. This is specifically useful for `ConstrainedDecimal` representing `Numeric(x,0)` (i.e., numeric types with 0 decimal places).

2. **Round-trip requirement**: The documentation explicitly states that encoding integer-valued decimals as floats "results in failed round-tripping between encode and parse". This indicates that preserving the integer nature of these values is important for the system to work correctly.

3. **Documented examples**: The docstring provides two examples:
   - `Decimal("1.0")` → `1.0` (float)
   - `Decimal("1")` → `1` (int)

4. **Numeric(x,0) context**: `Numeric(x,0)` in SQL databases represents a numeric type with x total digits and 0 decimal places - essentially an integer stored as a decimal type. The documentation suggests that values representing `Numeric(x,0)` should be encoded as integers to maintain round-trip capability.

5. **Historical context**: GitHub issue #2293 confirms that there were problems with ConstrainedDecimal round-tripping when decimal_places=0, and this was considered a bug that was fixed in PR #2294 for Pydantic v1.

### Critical Observation

The documentation's example shows `Decimal("1.0")` encoding to `1.0` (float), but the textual description says the function should encode decimals as int when representing `Numeric(x,0)` (integers). There's an apparent contradiction here:

- `Decimal("1.0")` represents the integer value 1 (it equals its integral value)
- For `Numeric(x,0)` use cases, this should encode as `int` to avoid round-trip failures
- But the example shows it encoding as `float`

The documentation is internally inconsistent. The docstring's prose suggests integer-valued decimals should encode as ints for round-trip purposes, but the example contradicts this by showing `Decimal("1.0")` → `1.0` (float).
