## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed and occurs exactly as described.

### Bug Summary
The `CombinedLock.locked()` method in xarray.backends.locks incorrectly returns `True` whenever the lock contains at least one constituent lock, regardless of whether any locks are actually acquired.

### Root Cause
The bug is on line 236 of /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/xarray_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray/backends/locks.py:

```python
def locked(self):
    return any(lock.locked for lock in self.locks)  # BUG: missing parentheses
```

The code uses `lock.locked` (a method reference) instead of `lock.locked()` (calling the method). In Python, method objects are always truthy, so `any(lock.locked for lock in self.locks)` evaluates to `True` whenever `self.locks` is non-empty.

### Test Results

1. **Simple reproduction test**: Confirmed that with two unlocked locks, `combined.locked()` returns `True` when it should return `False`.

2. **Hypothesis test**: Failed with input `lock_states=[False]`, confirming the bug occurs when no locks are acquired.

3. **Root cause verification**: Demonstrated that:
   - `lock.locked` is a method object that evaluates to `True`
   - `lock.locked()` is the actual call that returns `False` for unlocked locks
   - `any(lock.locked for lock in locks)` returns `True` (incorrect)
   - `any(lock.locked() for lock in locks)` returns `False` (correct)

### Impact
This bug causes `CombinedLock.locked()` to give incorrect status information. Any code relying on this method to check if a combined lock is acquired will receive wrong information, potentially leading to incorrect synchronization logic or debugging confusion.
