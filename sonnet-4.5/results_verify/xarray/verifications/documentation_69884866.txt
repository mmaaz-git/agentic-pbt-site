DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR RangeIndex.arange
============================================

## Official Documentation Found

From the source code docstring (lines 144-202 in range_index.py):
- The method creates a RangeIndex from given start, stop and step values
- Key statement at line 155: "the index is within the half-open interval [start, stop), with spacing between values given by step"
- The documentation explicitly states "spacing between values given by step" - this is a clear contract
- The example at lines 190-201 shows: RangeIndex.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.2, dim="x") producing values 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8
- The documentation says the methods are "similar to numpy.arange and numpy.linspace" (line 120)

## Documentation Claims vs Reality

The documentation makes these specific claims:
1. "spacing between values given by step" - This is explicitly promised
2. Methods are "similar to numpy.arange" - This suggests behavior should match numpy.arange
3. The example shows exact step values being preserved (0.2 step produces 0.2 spacing)

## What the Documentation Does NOT Say

The documentation does not specify:
- That the step parameter might be adjusted or recalculated
- That the actual step used might differ from the provided step
- Any difference in behavior from numpy.arange regarding step handling
- That the stop parameter takes precedence over step in determining spacing

## Implementation Details from Code

Looking at the implementation:
1. Line 219: size = math.ceil((stop - start) / step) - Uses step to calculate size
2. Lines 221-223: Creates RangeCoordinateTransform with (start, stop, size, ...)
3. Lines 58-65 in RangeCoordinateTransform: Recalculates step as (stop - start) / size
4. This means the step parameter is only used to determine the number of points, not the actual spacing

## Comparison with numpy.arange

numpy.arange(start, stop, step) produces values [start, start+step, start+2*step, ...] up to but not including stop.
The step value is preserved exactly, and the last value is determined by when the sequence exceeds stop.

RangeIndex.arange uses the step to calculate how many points fit in [start, stop), but then recalculates the actual step to evenly divide the interval [start, stop) into that many points.

## Conclusion

The documentation explicitly states "spacing between values given by step" and claims similarity to numpy.arange. The actual implementation does not preserve the step parameter, instead using it only to calculate the number of points and then recalculating a different step value. This is a clear contradiction between documented and actual behavior.
