## Documentation Analysis for CombinedLock.locked()

### Class Documentation
The CombinedLock class has a clear docstring that states:
"A combination of multiple locks. Like a locked door, a CombinedLock is locked if any of its constituent locks are locked."

This docstring establishes the expected behavior: the CombinedLock should be considered locked if ANY of its constituent locks are locked.

### Lock Interface Documentation
Based on Python's threading documentation and the implementations in the codebase:

1. **threading.Lock.locked()**: This is a METHOD that must be called with parentheses. The Python documentation clearly shows it as `locked()` - a method that "Return[s] True if the lock is acquired."

2. **SerializableLock.locked()**: Line 69-70 shows it correctly implements the method by calling `self.lock.locked()` with parentheses.

3. **DummyLock.locked()**: Lines 257-258 show it's implemented as a method that returns False.

4. **multiprocessing.Lock.locked()**: Also documented as a method that needs to be called.

### Expected Behavior
The documentation and interface consistently show that:
- `locked()` is a METHOD across all lock types, not a property
- It should return a boolean indicating whether the lock is currently held
- For CombinedLock, it should return True if ANY constituent lock is held

### Current Implementation Issue
Line 236 in CombinedLock has `return any(lock.locked for lock in self.locks)` which:
- Accesses `lock.locked` without calling it (missing parentheses)
- This returns the method object itself, not the result of calling the method
- Method objects are truthy in Python, so this always returns True when locks exist

The documentation is clear and unambiguous about the expected behavior. The current implementation violates the documented contract by not properly calling the locked() method on constituent locks.
