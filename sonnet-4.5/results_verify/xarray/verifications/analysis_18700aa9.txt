Bug Triage Analysis
===================

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The __dask_tokenize__ method violates Dask's documented requirement that tokens must be idempotent and deterministic
- The same object instance produces different tokens based on global state (OPTIONS)
- This breaks Dask's caching mechanism, causing unnecessary recomputation
- The __hash__ method also violates Python's requirement that hash values must not change during an object's lifetime
- The bug is reproducible with the provided test cases
- The issue has real consequences for performance and correctness in Dask operations
- The proposed fix is reasonable and addresses the root cause

**Evidence:**
- Dask documentation explicitly states tokens must be deterministic
- Python documentation explicitly states hash must be constant for object lifetime
- Both violations are clearly demonstrated in the reproduction

### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- (No strong reasons - the bug clearly violates documented requirements)

**Counter-evidence:**
- The Dask documentation is explicit about token consistency requirements
- The Python hash requirement is a fundamental language constraint
- The behavior is not undefined or ambiguous

### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Could argue this is an edge case if OPTIONS rarely change during execution
- The class is for internal deprecation handling, not user-facing

**Counter-evidence:**
- This affects core functionality (Dask caching) not just error messages
- The bug violates fundamental Python requirements (__hash__ consistency)
- The fix is simple and doesn't break any existing functionality
- Even if OPTIONS rarely change, when they do, it causes incorrect behavior

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The class has no documentation warning about this behavior
- Could document that the object shouldn't be used with Dask when OPTIONS might change

**Counter-evidence:**
- The bug is in the code, not the documentation
- The behavior violates well-established external requirements (Dask and Python)
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that supporting proper Dask tokenization is a new feature

**Counter-evidence:**
- The class already implements __dask_tokenize__, so it intends to support Dask
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality
- The implementation is incorrect, not missing

## Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation violates two fundamental requirements:

1. Dask's requirement that __dask_tokenize__ returns consistent tokens for the same object
2. Python's requirement that __hash__ returns consistent values during an object's lifetime

These violations have real consequences:
- Dask caching breaks, causing performance degradation
- Potential dictionary/set corruption if objects are used as keys
- Inconsistent behavior that could lead to hard-to-debug issues

The bug is well-documented, reproducible, and has a clear fix that addresses the root cause without breaking existing functionality. The fact that both __hash__ and __dask_tokenize__ have the same issue strengthens the case that this is a design flaw that needs correction.
