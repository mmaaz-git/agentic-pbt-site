## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
Arguments for INVALID:
- The method's docstring doesn't explicitly promise any particular behavior for non-existent keys
- KeyError is a standard Python exception for accessing non-existent keys in mappings
- The Indexes class implements collections.abc.Mapping, where KeyError is expected

Arguments against INVALID:
- The error message is completely unhelpful (just 'y' instead of explaining the problem)
- The same class has another method (get_all_coords) that handles this gracefully
- Users accessing this through Dataset.indexes would reasonably expect better error handling

**Verdict: This is NOT INVALID** - The inconsistency within the same class and poor error messaging make this a legitimate issue.

### Considering WONTFIX
Arguments for WONTFIX:
- This is a relatively minor issue that only affects error cases
- Users can work around it by checking if the key exists first
- The error type (KeyError) is technically correct for a Mapping

Arguments against WONTFIX:
- The fix is trivial to implement
- It improves API consistency within the same class
- Better error messages significantly improve developer experience
- The class is accessible through public API (Dataset.indexes)

**Verdict: This is NOT WONTFIX** - The issue affects usability and the fix is straightforward.

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The docstring could be updated to mention that KeyError is raised for invalid keys
- This would make the current behavior "documented" and thus correct

Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The current behavior is objectively worse than get_all_coords() in the same class
- Simply documenting bad behavior doesn't make it good
- The proposed fix improves the code, not just documentation

**Verdict: This is NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX** - The issue is with the implementation, not the documentation.

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Adding an `errors` parameter (as suggested in Option 2) would be a new feature
- The current implementation technically "works" (raises an error)

Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is about fixing inconsistent error handling, not adding new functionality
- The method already exists but has poor error handling
- Other methods in the same class handle this better

**Verdict: This is NOT a FEATURE_REQUEST** - This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new features.

### Considering BUG
Arguments for BUG:
- The error message provides no context about what went wrong
- The API is inconsistent with get_all_coords() in the same class
- The Indexes class is accessible through public API (Dataset.indexes, DataArray.indexes)
- The docstring says it returns "False otherwise" but it actually raises an exception
- Users reasonably expect either False or a helpful error message

Arguments against BUG:
- KeyError is technically correct for a Mapping class
- The behavior is consistent with standard Python dict behavior

**Verdict: This IS a BUG** - The poor error message, API inconsistency, and misleading docstring make this a valid bug.

### Final Analysis
This is a valid BUG. The key issues are:
1. **Misleading docstring**: Says "Return True if key maps to multi-coordinate index, False otherwise" - this implies it returns False for invalid keys, not raises an exception
2. **API inconsistency**: get_all_coords() in the same class handles missing keys gracefully with clear error messages
3. **Poor developer experience**: Raw KeyError with just the key name provides no context
4. **Public API**: Accessible through Dataset.indexes and DataArray.indexes properties
