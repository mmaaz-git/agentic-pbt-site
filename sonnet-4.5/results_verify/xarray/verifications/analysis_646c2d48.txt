## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
- **Against**: This is not a bug in functionality - the code works correctly and consistently with its implementation. The function behaves predictably with `end=False` as the default.
- **Against**: This is an internal function (prefixed with underscore) not part of the public API, so users shouldn't be relying on it directly.

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
- **For**: This is an internal function that users shouldn't be using directly. The inconsistency doesn't affect actual functionality.
- **Against**: Even internal functions should have accurate documentation for maintainers and contributors.
- **Against**: The tests and actual usage show the function is important for the library's HTML formatting functionality.

### Consideration for INVALID:
- **Against**: The bug report is factually correct - there IS a discrepancy between the documentation and implementation.
- **Against**: The reproduction code works and proves the issue exists.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- **For**: The code performs correctly and consistently - it's the documentation that's wrong.
- **For**: The function signature clearly shows `end: bool = False` and the function behaves accordingly.
- **For**: The actual usage in the codebase always explicitly passes the `end` parameter, so the default value documentation error hasn't caused functional issues.
- **For**: This is purely a documentation inconsistency - fixing the docstring to say "Default is False" would resolve the issue completely.
- **For**: The fix suggested in the bug report is exactly to update the documentation, not change the code behavior.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- **Against**: This is not requesting new functionality, but pointing out an existing documentation error.
- **Against**: The bug report isn't asking for the default to be changed to True, just for the documentation to match reality.

## Conclusion

This is clearly a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The function works correctly with `end=False` as its default, but the docstring incorrectly states "Default is True." The bug report itself suggests the correct fix - updating the docstring to reflect the actual default value. The code is working as designed; it's the documentation that needs correction.
