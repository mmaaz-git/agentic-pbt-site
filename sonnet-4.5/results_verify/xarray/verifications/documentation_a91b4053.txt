## Documentation Analysis

### Python's Hash Requirements
From the official Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__):

1. **Hash Stability Invariant**: The documentation does not explicitly state "hash must remain constant during lifetime" in the section I reviewed, but it strongly implies this through:
   - "Objects which compare equal must have the same hash value"
   - The recommendation against implementing __hash__ for mutable objects
   - The fact that mutable objects like lists don't implement __hash__

2. **Best Practices**: The documentation recommends hashing the tuple of immutable attributes used in equality comparisons.

### xarray Documentation
The CombineKwargDefault class has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Object that handles deprecation cycle for kwarg default values. Similar to ReprObject"
- No explicit documentation about hash behavior or intended use as dict keys/set elements

### Usage Analysis
From examining the xarray codebase:
1. CombineKwargDefault is used as default parameter values in various functions
2. It is compared using isinstance() and equality operators
3. The class implements __eq__ based on self._value (which changes with OPTIONS)
4. No explicit documentation states whether these objects should be hashable or used in sets/dicts

### Python's Implicit Contract
While not explicitly documented in the class, Python has a well-established contract:
- If a class implements __hash__, it promises to maintain hash stability
- Objects used in sets or as dict keys must have stable hashes
- The presence of __hash__ and __eq__ methods implies the object is intended to be hashable

### Conclusion
The bug violates Python's fundamental hash contract. Even without explicit documentation in xarray stating the hash should be stable, this is a universal Python requirement for any hashable object. The fact that the class implements __hash__ means it must follow Python's hash invariants.
