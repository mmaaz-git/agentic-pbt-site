# Reproduction of Bug Report

## Summary
I successfully reproduced the reported bug in xarray.plot.utils._infer_interval_breaks with unsorted coordinates.

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Manual Test Case Reproduction
The provided test case with coord=[0.0, -1.0] was successfully reproduced:

Input coordinates: [0.0, -1.0]
Data range: [-1.0, 0.0]
Interval breaks: [0.5, -0.5, -1.5]
Breaks range: [0.5, -1.5]

The issue is confirmed:
- First break (0.5) > minimum value (-1.0): This is INCORRECT
- Last break (-1.5) < maximum value (0.0): This is INCORRECT

### 2. Property-Based Test Reproduction
The Hypothesis test correctly identified the failure case. The property test asserts that:
- The first interval break should be <= the minimum coordinate value
- The last interval break should be >= the maximum coordinate value

These assertions fail for coord=[0.0, -1.0], confirming the bug.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
After examining the source code, the bug occurs because _infer_interval_breaks assumes:
- coord[0] is the minimum value (line 888: uses coord[0] for "first")
- coord[-1] is the maximum value (line 889: uses coord[-1] for "last")

This assumption is only valid for sorted arrays in ascending order.

### 4. Important Discovery about Monotonic Check
The check_monotonic parameter does NOT catch this case because:
- _is_monotonic accepts BOTH ascending and descending monotonic sequences
- [0.0, -1.0] is a valid monotonically descending sequence
- So check_monotonic=True does NOT raise an error for this input

However, the function still produces incorrect interval breaks for descending sequences because it assumes ascending order when computing the first and last breaks.

### 5. Additional Test Results
- Ascending sorted coordinates [-1.0, 0.0]: Works correctly, breaks cover full range
- Descending sorted coordinates [1.0, 0.0, -1.0]: Fails, breaks don't cover full range
- The function only works correctly for ascending monotonic sequences

## Conclusion
The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The function produces incorrect interval breaks for:
1. Unsorted coordinates
2. Descending monotonic coordinates

The breaks don't properly cover the data range, which would lead to incorrect visualizations in plotting functions.
