## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution Summary
I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. All test cases demonstrate the hash invariant violation.

### Test 1: Basic Hash Change
- Created a CombineKwargDefault object with old="old_val" and new="new_val"
- Initial hash when OPTIONS['use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults']=False: -1727899606998131916
- After toggling OPTIONS to True, hash changed to: 5545920891153589421
- **Result: Confirmed - hash value changes when global OPTIONS changes**

### Test 2: Dictionary Key Failure
- Created object and stored in dictionary as key
- Successfully retrieved value initially
- After changing OPTIONS, KeyError occurred when trying to access the same key
- **Result: Confirmed - objects become inaccessible in dictionaries when OPTIONS changes**

### Test 3: Hypothesis Property Test
- Ran property-based test with random inputs
- Test immediately failed with assertion error
- Error message: "Hash changed when global OPTIONS changed! Before: 0, After: -3334342472007712581"
- **Result: Confirmed - violates hash invariant for various input combinations**

### Test 4: Edge Case (old == new)
- When old and new values are identical ("same" == "same")
- Hash remains constant even when OPTIONS changes
- **Result: Hash is stable only when old equals new**

### Technical Verification
The bug occurs exactly as described:
1. `__hash__()` returns `hash(self._value)`
2. `_value` property dynamically returns either `_old` or `_new` based on global OPTIONS
3. When OPTIONS changes, _value changes, causing hash to change
4. This violates Python's fundamental requirement that hash values remain constant during object lifetime

### Impact Assessment
This is a real bug that can cause:
- Silent failures when using CombineKwargDefault objects as dictionary keys
- Objects disappearing from sets
- Unpredictable behavior in any hash-based data structure
- Potential data loss or corruption in code relying on these objects as keys
