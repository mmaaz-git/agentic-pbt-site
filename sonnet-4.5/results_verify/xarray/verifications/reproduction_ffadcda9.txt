## Bug Reproduction Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is in the `collapsible_section` function in `xarray/core/formatting_html.py`.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test correctly fails when run with negative n_items values. The test expects "disabled" to be in the result string when n_items is negative, but this expectation is not met.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: Running the specific example with `n_items=-1` confirms the bug:
   - Result contains 'disabled': False (should be True)
   - Result contains 'checked': True (should be False)
   - Displays count '(-1)': True (nonsensical negative count is displayed)

### Code Analysis

Looking at the source code (line 179 of formatting_html.py):
```python
has_items = n_items is not None and n_items
```

This line uses Python's truthiness evaluation. Since negative numbers are truthy in Python (only 0 is falsy), `-1` evaluates to `True`, causing the function to treat negative values as if there are items to display.

### Actual Output

The HTML generated for `collapsible_section("Test Section", n_items=-1)` shows:
- The checkbox has the `checked` attribute (meaning it's expanded)
- No `disabled` attribute is present (meaning it's enabled)
- The count displays as "(-1)" which is nonsensical in a UI context

This confirms that the bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
