## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### 1. INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible - the function does crash with IndexError
- The crash prevents Django from displaying proper debug information
- The function already has defensive programming for other edge cases (source=None)
- A debugging utility should not crash while generating debug information

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise to handle invalid line numbers
- One could argue that Jinja2 should never produce exceptions with invalid line numbers
- The caller might be responsible for validation

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID - The bug is real and impacts functionality

#### 2. WONTFIX
**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it can happen with malformed templates or corrupted state
- The fix is trivial (3-4 lines of code)
- The crash prevents the debug page from working, which is a core Django feature
- Other parts of the function already handle edge cases gracefully

**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- One might argue that invalid line numbers should never occur in practice
- Could be considered an internal implementation detail

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX - The impact is significant and the fix is simple

#### 3. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not adding new functionality
- The function already attempts to handle edge cases (source=None case)
- This is fixing a crash, not adding a feature

**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be argued that handling invalid line numbers is a "new feature"
- The original implementation might have assumed valid line numbers

**Verdict:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing existing functionality, not adding new

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code is actually broken - it crashes
- The documentation doesn't promise this behavior one way or another
- Fixing documentation wouldn't solve the crash

**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be updated to say "requires valid line numbers"
- Could document that callers must validate line numbers

**Verdict:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code needs fixing, not just documentation

#### 5. BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The function crashes with an IndexError on certain inputs
- The crash prevents Django's debug page from working properly
- The function's purpose is to format exception info for debugging - crashing defeats this purpose
- The function already handles other edge cases (source=None), showing defensive programming intent
- The fix is straightforward and consistent with existing error handling
- Valid Jinja2 exceptions could theoretically have line numbers beyond the source
- The bug affects a user-facing feature (debug page)

**Arguments against BUG:**
- Not explicitly documented to handle this case
- Could be considered caller's responsibility

**Verdict:** THIS IS A BUG

### Final Analysis
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function `get_exception_info` is a utility for formatting exception information for Django's debug page. When it crashes due to an IndexError, it prevents the debug page from displaying, which defeats its purpose. The function already demonstrates defensive programming by handling the case where source is None, indicating that it should gracefully handle edge cases. The proposed fix is minimal, safe, and consistent with the function's existing error-handling approach.
