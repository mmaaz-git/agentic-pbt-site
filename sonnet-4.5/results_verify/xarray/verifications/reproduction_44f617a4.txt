## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Environment
- Python version: 3.13
- xarray installation: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/xarray_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray
- Function location: xarray/backends/plugins.py lines 91-101

### Reproduction Confirmed: YES

The bug report is technically correct. The `sort_backends` function DOES mutate its input dictionary by removing entries that match the `NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER` list.

### Test Results

#### Test 1: Basic Reproduction (from bug report)
- Input: `{"scipy": MockBackend, "custom": MockBackend}`
- After calling `sort_backends()`:
  - Input dictionary: `{"custom": MockBackend}` (scipy was removed)
  - Returned dictionary: `{"scipy": MockBackend, "custom": MockBackend}`
- **Result**: Input dictionary was mutated - "scipy" key was removed

#### Test 2: Property-based test (from bug report)
- Input: `{"scipy": MockBackend}`
- After calling `sort_backends()`:
  - Input dictionary: `{}` (empty - scipy was removed)
  - Returned dictionary: `{"scipy": MockBackend}`
- **Result**: Test FAILED as expected - input was mutated

#### Test 3: All NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER entries
- Input: 6 entries including all three NETCDF backends
- After calling `sort_backends()`:
  - All three NETCDF backends ("netcdf4", "h5netcdf", "scipy") were removed from input
  - Only custom backends remained in the input dictionary
- **Result**: Confirms the pattern - all NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER entries are removed

#### Test 4: No NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER entries
- Input: Only custom backends not in NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER
- After calling `sort_backends()`:
  - Input dictionary unchanged
  - Result properly sorted alphabetically
- **Result**: No mutation when no NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER entries present

### Root Cause Analysis

The mutation occurs at line 97 in plugins.py:
```python
ordered_backends_entrypoints[be_name] = backend_entrypoints.pop(be_name)
```

The `.pop()` method removes the key from the original dictionary while retrieving its value. This happens for every backend name in `NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER` that exists in the input.

### Impact Assessment

1. **The bug is real**: The function does mutate its input as claimed.

2. **The mutation is consistent**: It always removes entries matching NETCDF_BACKENDS_ORDER.

3. **The function still works correctly** from a functional perspective - it returns the properly sorted dictionary.

4. **The mutation is a side effect**, not the primary purpose of the function.

### Verification of Bug Report Claims

✓ The function mutates the input dictionary - CONFIRMED
✓ Uses `.pop()` which removes keys - CONFIRMED
✓ The specific test case `has_scipy=True, num_custom=0` fails - CONFIRMED
✓ The behavior violates principle of least surprise - This is a subjective claim but reasonable

The technical details in the bug report are accurate and the reproduction code works as described.
