Bug Reproduction Results
========================

Test Code Execution:
--------------------
I ran the exact reproduction code provided in the bug report with scale_factor=0.0, add_offset=10.0,
and data=[1., 2., 3., 4., 5.].

Results Observed:
-----------------
1. During ENCODING (line 518 of variables.py):
   - Operation: data /= scale_factor (which is data /= 0.0)
   - Result: All values become -inf
   - Warning: "divide by zero encountered in divide" (RuntimeWarning)

2. During DECODING:
   - Operation: data *= scale_factor (which is -inf * 0.0)
   - Result: All values become NaN
   - This is mathematically correct: infinity * 0 = NaN

3. Round-trip property violation:
   - Original data: [1. 2. 3. 4. 5.]
   - Encoded data: [-inf -inf -inf -inf -inf]
   - Decoded data: [nan nan nan nan nan]
   - The identity property decode(encode(var)) == var is VIOLATED

4. Hypothesis test results:
   - The hypothesis test fails on the very first example
   - ANY non-NaN, non-infinite input data will fail when scale_factor=0.0
   - The data becomes completely corrupted (all NaN values)

Technical Analysis:
-------------------
The bug is technically accurate and reproducible. The code behavior matches exactly what the bug report describes:
1. Division by zero during encoding produces infinities
2. Multiplying infinities by zero during decoding produces NaN
3. The round-trip property required by VariableCoder is violated
4. Data is silently corrupted with only a RuntimeWarning

The bug report's assertion that this violates the documented contract of VariableCoder is correct,
as the base class explicitly states that encode/decode must satisfy the identity property.
