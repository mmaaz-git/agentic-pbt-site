## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and occurs exactly as described.

### Test Results

1. **Property-based test with Hypothesis**: The test runs and fails on the input `'"'` (a single quote character).

2. **Manual reproduction with the specific failing input**:
   - Input: `'"'` (a single quote character)
   - First call to `quote_etag('"')` returns: `'"""'`
   - Second call to `quote_etag('"""')` returns: `'"""""'`
   - Third call to `quote_etag('"""""')` returns: `'"""""""'`

The function is clearly not idempotent. Each successive call adds more quotes, creating an unbounded growth pattern.

### Code Analysis

Looking at the implementation in `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/utils/http.py` lines 212-220:

```python
def quote_etag(etag_str):
    """
    If the provided string is already a quoted ETag, return it. Otherwise, wrap
    the string in quotes, making it a strong ETag.
    """
    if ETAG_MATCH.match(etag_str):
        return etag_str
    else:
        return '"%s"' % etag_str
```

The ETAG_MATCH regex (lines 15-25) expects `[^"]*` - meaning "any sequence of non-quote characters" between the quotes. This regex correctly identifies that `'"""'` is NOT a valid ETag (since it contains quotes inside), but the function then wraps it in quotes again, creating `'"""""'`, which also doesn't match, leading to further wrapping.

### Effect

The bug causes:
1. Violation of the documented idempotence property
2. Unbounded string growth on repeated applications
3. Creation of invalid ETags that don't conform to RFC specifications

The bug is confirmed and reproducible.
