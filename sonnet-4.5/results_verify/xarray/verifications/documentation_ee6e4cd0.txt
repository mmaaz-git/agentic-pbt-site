## Documentation Analysis for xarray.indexes.RangeIndex.arange

### What the documentation states:

1. **Class documentation (lines 111-126)**:
   - RangeIndex implements "a simple bounded 1-dimension interval with evenly spaced, monotonic floating-point values"
   - States "Do not use __init__ directly. Instead use RangeIndex.arange or RangeIndex.linspace, which are similar to numpy.arange and numpy.linspace" (lines 119-120)

2. **Method documentation for arange (lines 144-203)**:
   - The docstring explicitly states it can be called with varying positional arguments, similar to numpy.arange
   - Shows three calling patterns matching numpy.arange exactly
   - Provides examples showing the expected behavior
   - States "the interval includes this value" for start and "the interval does not include this value" for stop
   - Step parameter documented as "Spacing between values (default: 1.0)"

3. **Comparison with numpy.arange**:
   - The documentation explicitly says it is "similar to numpy.arange" (line 120)
   - numpy.arange generates values as: start, start+step, start+2*step, ... until reaching (but not including) stop
   - numpy.arange(-1.5, 0.0, 1.0) produces [-1.5, -0.5]

### Key findings:

The documentation clearly states that RangeIndex.arange should be "similar to numpy.arange". The word "similar" implies it should produce the same values for the same inputs, especially since:

1. The method signature matches numpy.arange exactly
2. The documentation describes the same half-open interval behavior [start, stop)
3. The step parameter is documented as "spacing between values" which has a clear mathematical meaning
4. No warnings or caveats are provided about differences from numpy.arange

The documentation does not mention that:
- The step might be recalculated internally
- The values might differ from numpy.arange in some cases
- There is any deviation from numpy.arange's behavior

Based on the documentation alone, a user would reasonably expect RangeIndex.arange(-1.5, 0.0, 1.0) to produce values [-1.5, -0.5], matching numpy.arange exactly.
