## Bug Reproduction Results

### Technical Verification
I successfully reproduced the bug as reported. The behavior is exactly as described:

1. **Irreflexivity Violation Confirmed**:
   - `AlwaysGreaterThan() > AlwaysGreaterThan()` returns `True` (should be `False`)
   - `AlwaysLessThan() < AlwaysLessThan()` returns `True` (should be `False`)
   - This violates the mathematical axiom that no element can be strictly greater/less than itself

2. **Trichotomy Violation Confirmed**:
   - For two `AlwaysGreaterThan` instances: both `==` and `>` return `True`
   - For two `AlwaysLessThan` instances: both `==` and `<` return `True`
   - This violates the trichotomy law where exactly one of `<`, `==`, or `>` should be true

3. **Contrast with np.inf**:
   - `np.inf > np.inf` correctly returns `False`
   - `np.inf == np.inf` returns `True`
   - NumPy's infinity correctly maintains irreflexivity and trichotomy

### Root Cause Analysis
The implementation is straightforward but flawed:
```python
class AlwaysGreaterThan:
    def __gt__(self, other):
        return True  # Always returns True, even for self-comparison

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return isinstance(other, type(self))  # Returns True for any instance of same type
```

The `__gt__` method unconditionally returns `True` without checking if `other` is an instance of the same type. This creates the logical inconsistency where an object is both equal to and greater than another object of the same type.

### Practical Impact Testing
1. **Sorting still works** but may produce unexpected orderings when multiple INF/NINF values are present
2. **Max/min functions work correctly**, selecting INF as maximum and NINF as minimum
3. **Transitivity is maintained** for comparisons with other types
4. **Cannot be used in sets** (unhashable type error)

### Hypothesis Test Results
All three hypothesis tests from the bug report failed as expected:
- `test_always_greater_than_irreflexivity`: Failed
- `test_trichotomy_law`: Failed (2 conditions true instead of 1)
- `test_always_less_than_irreflexivity`: Failed

The bug is accurately reported and reproducible.
