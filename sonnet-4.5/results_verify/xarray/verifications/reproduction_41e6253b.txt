REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR _codes_to_group_indices BUG REPORT
===========================================================

1. BUG REPRODUCTION - CONFIRMED:
All the examples in the bug report were successfully reproduced and behave exactly as described:

Test Case 1: codes=[1], N=1
- RESULT: IndexError: tuple index out of range
- EXPECTED BY REPORT: IndexError
- STATUS: ✓ Reproduced

Test Case 2: codes=[5, 2, 8], N=3
- RESULT: IndexError: tuple index out of range
- EXPECTED BY REPORT: IndexError
- STATUS: ✓ Reproduced

Test Case 3: codes=[0, 1, 2, 3], N=2
- RESULT: IndexError: tuple index out of range
- EXPECTED BY REPORT: IndexError
- STATUS: ✓ Reproduced

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The IndexError occurs at line 92 of the function:
```python
groups[g].append(n)
```

When g >= N, this tries to access groups[g] where groups is a tuple of N lists (indices 0 to N-1). Accessing groups[g] when g >= N causes the tuple index out of range error.

3. VALID CASES TESTED:
The function works correctly when codes are in the valid range [-1, N):

- codes=[0, 1, 0, 1], N=2 → Result: ([0, 2], [1, 3]) ✓
- codes=[-1, 0, 1, -1], N=2 → Result: ([1], [2]) ✓
- codes=[0], N=1 → Result: ([0],) ✓
- codes=[], N=5 → Result: ([], [], [], [], []) ✓
- codes=[-1, -2, -3], N=3 → Result: ([], [], []) ✓

4. HYPOTHESIS TESTING:
Ran 50 randomly generated test cases with hypothesis testing framework:
- All cases with max(codes) >= N resulted in IndexError
- All cases with max(codes) < N succeeded
- Pattern is 100% consistent

5. BEHAVIOR SUMMARY:
Current behavior:
- Negative codes: Silently ignored (treated as "no group")
- Codes in [0, N): Processed correctly
- Codes >= N: IndexError with uninformative message

What the bug report claims should happen:
- Either validate inputs and provide descriptive error
- Or handle out-of-range codes gracefully

6. TECHNICAL ACCURACY OF BUG REPORT:
The bug report is TECHNICALLY ACCURATE:
- The reproduction code works exactly as stated
- The error messages match exactly
- The root cause analysis is correct
- The proposed fixes would resolve the issue

7. COMPARISON WITH SIMILAR CODE:
Looking at how the function is called in practice:
- It receives codes from pandas factorization which typically ensures codes are in [0, n_groups)
- The -1 handling suggests negative codes are expected (for NaN groups)
- No caller appears to validate codes before calling this function

CONCLUSION:
The bug report is accurate in its technical details. The function does crash with an uninformative IndexError when codes contain values >= N, exactly as described.
