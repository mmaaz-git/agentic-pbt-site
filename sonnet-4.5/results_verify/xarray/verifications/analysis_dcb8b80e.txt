## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG Classification
**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. **Silent data loss**: The function accepts negative degree coefficients but silently drops them during processing
2. **Incorrect results**: Mathematical computations produce wrong answers without warning
3. **Inconsistent behavior**: The function validates that degrees are integers but doesn't validate non-negativity
4. **Reasonable user expectation**: Users who explicitly label coefficients with negative degrees expect them to be used
5. **Mathematical precedent**: Laurent polynomials are a valid mathematical concept that includes negative degrees
6. **No explicit restriction**: Documentation doesn't forbid negative degrees

**Strength**: STRONG - This is the most likely classification. The function accepts input it can't handle correctly and produces wrong results silently.

### Consideration for INVALID Classification
**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. NumPy's polyval (referenced in docs) typically works with non-negative degrees
2. Standard polynomial convention uses non-negative degrees

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function explicitly accepts negative degree coordinates without error
2. Silent data loss is almost never acceptable behavior
3. Mathematical extensions (Laurent polynomials) do exist for negative degrees

**Strength**: WEAK - The silent failure makes this unlikely to be invalid.

### Consideration for WONTFIX Classification
**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. Supporting negative degrees might be considered an obscure edge case
2. Most polynomial applications use non-negative degrees

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function already accepts negative degrees - it just handles them incorrectly
2. Silent data loss is a serious issue, not a minor inconvenience
3. The fix is simple: either support negative degrees or raise an error

**Strength**: WEAK - Silent data corruption is too serious for WONTFIX.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST Classification
**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Supporting negative degrees (Laurent polynomials) could be seen as a new feature
2. Current implementation might have been designed only for standard polynomials

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function already accepts negative degree input - it's not rejecting it
2. This is about fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
3. Silent data loss is a bug, not a missing feature

**Strength**: WEAK - The function already accepts the input, so this isn't about adding new functionality.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification
**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. Documentation doesn't specify that only non-negative degrees are supported
2. Could be fixed by documenting the restriction and adding validation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code behavior (silent data loss) is inherently problematic
2. Even with documentation, silently dropping data is poor design
3. The function should either support negative degrees or explicitly reject them

**Strength**: MODERATE - This could be a documentation issue, but the silent failure suggests a code bug.

### Conclusion

This should be classified as **BUG** because:

1. **Primary issue is silent data loss**: The function accepts input (negative degree coefficients) but silently ignores part of it, leading to incorrect results without any warning or error.

2. **Violates principle of least surprise**: Users who explicitly provide negative degree coordinates have a reasonable expectation they'll be used.

3. **Easy to fix properly**: The function should either:
   - Support negative degrees correctly (Laurent polynomial evaluation), OR
   - Explicitly validate and reject negative degrees with a clear error message

4. **Not just a documentation issue**: Even if documented, silently dropping user data is poor API design and should be fixed in code.

The proposed fix in the bug report (raising a ValueError for negative degrees) is a reasonable minimal fix, though supporting Laurent polynomials would be the more complete solution.
