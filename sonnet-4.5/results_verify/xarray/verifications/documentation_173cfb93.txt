## Documentation Analysis for build_grid_chunks

### Function Documentation
The `build_grid_chunks` function has **no docstring** and appears to be an internal implementation detail of the xarray library, specifically in the `xarray.backends.chunks` module.

### Lack of Public Documentation
- No documentation found in xarray's public API documentation
- Web searches reveal no official documentation for this specific function
- The function is not exposed in xarray's public API

### Inferred Purpose from Code Context
Based on code analysis, the function's purpose is clear from its usage:

1. **Called by `grid_rechunk`**: At line 164, it receives `sum(var_chunks)` as the size parameter
2. **Used with `align_nd_chunks`**: The result is passed to `align_nd_chunks` which validates a critical invariant

### Critical Invariant from Code
The function `align_nd_chunks` (lines 20-25) explicitly validates that:
```python
if sum(backend_chunks) != sum(var_chunks):
    raise ValueError(
        "The number of elements in the backend does not "
        "match the number of elements in the variable. "
        "This inconsistency should never occur at this stage."
    )
```

This validation makes it clear that **the sum of chunks MUST equal the total size**. The error message even states "This inconsistency should never occur at this stage."

### Expected Behavior Based on Mathematical Logic
The function name `build_grid_chunks` and its parameters (`size`, `chunk_size`) clearly indicate it should divide a `size` into chunks of at most `chunk_size`. This is a standard chunking/partitioning operation where:
- Input: total size and desired chunk size
- Output: tuple of chunk sizes that sum to the total size

For any partitioning function, the fundamental mathematical invariant is:
```
sum(chunks) == total_size
```

This is true for all valid inputs, including `size=0`, which should produce an empty partition.

### Conclusion
While there is no explicit documentation, the code's context and mathematical semantics make it unambiguous that:
1. The function should partition a size into chunks
2. The sum of returned chunks must equal the input size
3. When size=0, the function should return an empty tuple or chunks that sum to 0
4. The current behavior (returning chunks that sum to a non-zero value when size=0) violates the fundamental partitioning invariant
