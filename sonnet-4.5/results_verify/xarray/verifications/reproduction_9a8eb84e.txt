## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report is accurate and has been successfully reproduced. The CFDatetimeCoder does indeed lose precision when performing round-trip encoding/decoding of high-precision datetime values.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test using Hypothesis successfully identified a failing case with the input:
- `datetime_list=[datetime.datetime(2003, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)]`

This matches exactly what the bug report claimed would fail.

### Minimal Reproduction Results
Running the minimal reproduction example confirms the precision loss:
- Original datetime: 2003-01-01T00:00:00.000001000 (1041379200000001000 nanoseconds)
- Decoded datetime: 2003-01-01T00:00:00.000000976 (1041379200000000976 nanoseconds)
- Lost precision: 24 nanoseconds

### Warning Emitted
The code does emit a warning during encoding:
"Times can't be serialized faithfully to int64 with requested units 'days since 2000-01-01'. Resolution of 'microseconds' needed."

This warning acknowledges that precision loss will occur but proceeds anyway, resulting in silent data corruption.

### Root Cause
The precision loss occurs because:
1. The datetime has microsecond-level precision (1 microsecond = 1000 nanoseconds)
2. It's being encoded with "days since 2000-01-01" units
3. When using floating-point representation with coarse units (days), the limited precision of float64 cannot accurately represent microsecond-level differences
4. The conversion from days (float64) back to nanoseconds introduces rounding errors

### Impact
This bug affects:
- Scientific applications requiring high temporal precision
- Time series data with microsecond/nanosecond resolution
- Any workflow that saves and reloads xarray datasets with precise datetime coordinates
- Users who expect xarray to preserve their data faithfully during I/O operations

The bug is real and represents a violation of the documented round-trip property for the coder.
