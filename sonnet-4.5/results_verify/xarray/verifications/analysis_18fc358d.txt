## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
**Supporting evidence:**
1. **Actual vulnerability**: The function allows HTML injection, which is a real security issue
2. **Inconsistent behavior**: Every other function in the module that generates HTML uses `escape()` to sanitize input
3. **Public API**: The function is publicly accessible and can be called by external code
4. **Clear pattern violation**: The module establishes a clear pattern of escaping HTML, which this function violates
5. **Reproducible**: The issue is easily reproducible with the provided test case
6. **Security impact**: HTML injection can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the output is rendered in a browser

**Why this IS a bug:**
- The function generates HTML but doesn't follow basic security practices
- It's inconsistent with the rest of the module's implementation
- Even without explicit documentation, HTML-generating functions have an implicit contract to be safe

#### INVALID (Incorrect report)
**Potential arguments against:**
1. No documentation explicitly requires HTML escaping
2. Internal usage only passes hardcoded strings

**Why this is NOT invalid:**
- The bug report is technically correct - the function does allow HTML injection
- The function is publicly accessible, not internal-only
- Security vulnerabilities don't need to be documented to be bugs
- The reproduction code works exactly as described

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
**Potential arguments for WONTFIX:**
1. Current internal usage doesn't pass user input
2. The function might be considered internal despite being accessible

**Why this is NOT wontfix:**
- Security vulnerabilities are never trivial
- The function is part of the public API (accessible from outside)
- The fix is simple (one line change) and improves security
- HTML injection vulnerabilities are serious enough to warrant fixing

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
**Potential arguments:**
1. Adding HTML escaping could be seen as a new feature

**Why this is NOT a feature request:**
- This is fixing a security vulnerability, not adding new functionality
- The expected behavior (safe HTML generation) already exists in other functions
- Security fixes are bug fixes, not feature additions

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
**Potential arguments:**
1. Could document that the function doesn't escape HTML
2. Could mark the function as internal-only

**Why this is NOT just a documentation fix:**
- The code behavior is incorrect from a security perspective
- Documentation warning users about a vulnerability is not a substitute for fixing it
- The inconsistency with other functions suggests the lack of escaping is unintentional

### Severity Assessment

**Medium to High severity because:**
1. **Security impact**: Allows HTML/JavaScript injection
2. **Public API**: External code can call this function
3. **No warnings**: Users have no indication the function is unsafe
4. **Pattern violation**: Inconsistent with module's security practices

### Recommendation

This should be triaged as **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Security vulnerability**: HTML injection is a well-recognized security issue
2. **Inconsistent implementation**: The function violates the module's established pattern
3. **Simple fix**: Adding `escape()` is a one-line change that eliminates the vulnerability
4. **Public API**: As a publicly accessible function, it should handle arbitrary input safely
5. **Industry standards**: HTML-generating functions are expected to be safe by default

The bug report is well-written, includes a working reproduction, and correctly identifies both the problem and the solution. The fix is minimal, non-breaking, and aligns the function with the rest of the module's implementation.
