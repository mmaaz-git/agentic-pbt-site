## Bug Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

### Test Setup
- Environment: xarray version 2025.9.0
- Python 3.13
- Test data: NamedArray with dimensions ('x', 'y') and shape (2, 3)

### Reproduction Results

1. **Basic reproduction test confirmed the bug:**
   - When calling `arr.permute_dims('x', 'z', missing_dims='ignore')`, a ValueError is raised
   - The error message: "('x', 'z') must be a permuted list of ('x', 'y'), unless `...` is included"
   - This happens despite setting `missing_dims='ignore'`

2. **Same issue with `missing_dims='warn'`:**
   - The function still raises ValueError instead of issuing a warning
   - Same error message as with 'ignore'

3. **With `missing_dims='raise'` (default):**
   - Different error message: "Dimensions {'z'} do not exist. Expected one or more of ('x', 'y')"
   - This is the expected behavior for the 'raise' option
   - Note: A warning is also printed when using 'raise', which suggests the warning mechanism works

4. **Hypothesis test results:**
   - The property-based test failed for all tested values (n=1 to 10)
   - Every test case raised ValueError despite `missing_dims='ignore'`
   - This confirms the bug is consistent and reproducible

### Key Finding
The bug is real and consistently reproducible. When `missing_dims` is set to 'ignore' or 'warn', the function should handle missing dimensions gracefully, but instead it raises a ValueError. The error originates from a validation check that occurs after the missing dimensions have been filtered out, which doesn't account for the `missing_dims` parameter setting.
