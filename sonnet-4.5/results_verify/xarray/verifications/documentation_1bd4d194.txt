## Documentation Analysis

### NumPy's isdtype Function Documentation

1. **Official NumPy Documentation (2.0+)**:
   - Function signature: `numpy.isdtype(dtype, kind)`
   - Purpose: "Determine if a provided dtype is of a specified data type kind"
   - Parameter `dtype`: Described as "The input dtype"
   - No explicit statement about whether scalar values are supported
   - Examples only show dtype objects and type classes, not scalar values

2. **NumPy's Actual Behavior (2.3.0)**:
   - Accepts: `np.dtype('int64')`, `np.int64` (type class)
   - Rejects: `np.int64(5)` (scalar), string dtypes
   - Error message: "dtype argument must be a NumPy dtype"
   - This clearly indicates scalars are NOT intended to be supported

3. **xarray's Fallback Implementation**:
   - Created as a compatibility shim for NumPy < 2.0
   - Function signature matches NumPy's: `isdtype(dtype, kind)`
   - The parameter is named `dtype`, suggesting dtype objects are expected
   - However, the code attempts to handle scalars (np.generic instances)
   - This appears to be an attempt to be more permissive than NumPy's spec

4. **Array API Standard**:
   - isdtype was added to NumPy 2.0 for Array API standard compliance
   - Standard describes it as checking "dtype" objects, not scalar values
   - The standard's examples use dtype objects, not scalars

### Key Documentation Insights

1. **Naming Convention**: The parameter is consistently named `dtype` across all documentation, strongly suggesting dtype objects are the intended input, not scalar values.

2. **NumPy's Intent**: NumPy 2.0+ explicitly rejects scalar values, indicating this is the intended behavior.

3. **xarray's Extension**: The fallback code tries to extend functionality to handle scalars, going beyond what NumPy specifies or supports.

4. **No Documentation for Scalar Support**: Neither NumPy nor xarray documentation mentions that scalar values should be accepted by isdtype.

### Conclusion

The documentation and NumPy's implementation both indicate that `isdtype` is intended for dtype objects, not scalar values. xarray's attempt to support scalars in the fallback appears to be an undocumented extension that goes beyond the specified behavior. However, since the code explicitly tries to handle this case (with `isinstance(dtype, np.generic)`), the implementation bug preventing it from working is still a valid issue within xarray's extended functionality.
