REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

1. TEST EXECUTION
-----------------
The hypothesis test from the bug report was executed and confirmed to fail on the specific input:
- start=817040.0, stop=0.0, num=18
- The test assertion `assert values[-1] == stop` failed
- Error: Last value 1.1641532182693481e-10 != stop 0.0

2. MANUAL REPRODUCTION
----------------------
I ran the manual reproduction code provided in the bug report and confirmed:
- xarray RangeIndex.linspace produces: last value = 1.1641532182693481e-10
- Expected value: 0.0
- The values do not match (values[-1] == stop returns False)
- numpy.linspace produces: last value = 0.0 (exact match)
- The relative error is approximately 1.42e-16

3. ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION
--------------------------
The bug report correctly identifies the root cause in RangeCoordinateTransform.forward() at line 69:
```python
labels = self.start + positions * self.step
```

For the failing case:
- start = 817040.0
- stop = 0.0 (after adjustment in linspace: stop = 865060.0)
- step = (865060.0 - 817040.0) / 18 = 48020.0 / 18
- For position 17: 817040.0 + 17 * (48020.0/18) accumulates floating-point errors

4. ADDITIONAL TESTING
---------------------
I tested additional cases and found the issue is not consistent:
- (100.0, 0.0, 10): Works correctly (exact match)
- (1000.0, 0.0, 11): Works correctly (exact match)
- (817040.0, 0.0, 18): FAILS (error ~1.16e-10)

This confirms it's a floating-point precision issue that manifests with certain combinations of start/stop/num values.

5. COMPARISON WITH NUMPY
------------------------
numpy.linspace correctly produces exact endpoint values for all test cases, including the failing one. The difference in implementation is that numpy uses a more numerically stable interpolation formula, while xarray uses simple arithmetic that accumulates errors.

CONCLUSION
----------
The bug is real and reproducible. The xarray RangeIndex.linspace() function does not guarantee that the last value exactly equals the stop parameter when endpoint=True, contrary to both its documentation and the expected behavior matching numpy.linspace().
