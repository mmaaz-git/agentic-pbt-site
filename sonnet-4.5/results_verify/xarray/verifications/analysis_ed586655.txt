BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

Evaluating against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   Why it MIGHT be a BUG:
   - The function violates the fundamental principle of caching: cached values should be immutable
   - Python's lru_cache documentation warns against caching functions that create "distinct mutable objects"
   - The function name "_load_static_files" implies the data is static and shouldn't change
   - The bug can cause real problems: corrupting HTML visualizations in Jupyter notebooks
   - The fix is simple and correct: return a tuple instead of a list
   - The behavior is clearly unintended - no one expects cached values to be mutable

   Why it might NOT be a BUG:
   - The function is internal (underscore-prefixed) and not part of the public API
   - No explicit documentation states the return value must be immutable

2. INVALID
   Why it MIGHT be INVALID:
   - The function is internal and users shouldn't be calling it directly
   - There's no explicit documentation requiring immutability

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - Even internal functions should follow best practices
   - The caching decorator implies immutability
   - Other xarray code could accidentally mutate the cache
   - The bug violates well-established caching principles

3. WONTFIX
   Why it MIGHT be WONTFIX:
   - The function is internal and rarely called directly
   - The likelihood of accidental mutation in practice might be low

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental caching violation
   - The fix is trivial (change list to tuple)
   - The bug could cause real issues in production
   - It's not about handling invalid input but about correct caching behavior

4. FEATURE_REQUEST
   Why it MIGHT be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could be seen as requesting "better" caching behavior

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
   - Caching should inherently provide immutable results
   - The current behavior is a bug, not a missing feature

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   Why it MIGHT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly state immutability requirements

   Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
   - Caching immutability is an implicit contract
   - The fix should be in the code, not documentation

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is clearly a BUG. The function uses @lru_cache but returns a mutable list, violating the fundamental principle that cached values should be immutable. This can lead to cache corruption where modifications by one caller affect all subsequent callers. The bug is well-documented, reproducible, and has a simple fix (return tuple instead of list). Even though the function is internal, it's still a legitimate bug that violates caching best practices and could cause real issues in production.
