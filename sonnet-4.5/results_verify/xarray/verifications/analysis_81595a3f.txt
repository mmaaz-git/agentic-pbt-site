# Bug Report Categorization Analysis

## Considerations for Each Category

### BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. `pretty_print()` has explicit documentation stating it returns a string "that is numchars long" - the function violates this documented contract
2. The bug is reproducible and deterministic
3. The violation occurs in normal usage scenarios (small but valid parameter values)
4. The function names create reasonable expectations that are violated
5. The fix is straightforward and doesn't break backward compatibility for normal use cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. These appear to be internal utility functions (in `core` subpackage)
2. Using extremely small values (1-2 characters) for truncation might be considered edge cases

### INVALID (Incorrect report, code works as intended)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Functions might be considered internal (in `core` subpackage) with no public API contract
2. Could argue that truncation with "..." requires at least 3 characters to be meaningful

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The docstring for `pretty_print()` explicitly promises exact length output
2. The functions are exported and accessible
3. No documentation states minimum values for parameters
4. The bug report correctly identifies actual behavior that contradicts documented/expected behavior

### WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Edge case with very small truncation lengths (1-2 characters) that rarely occur in practice
2. Truncating to 1-2 characters isn't particularly useful in real applications
3. The functions appear to be internal utilities

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The bug violates an explicit documentation promise
2. Property-based testing legitimately found this issue
3. Even edge cases should work correctly when the contract is explicit
4. The fix is simple and doesn't harm normal usage

### FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
None - the functions already claim to support these operations

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The docstring explicitly states the behavior should work
2. This isn't asking for new functionality but fixing existing broken functionality
3. The parameters already accept these values

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could update documentation to specify minimum values for parameters
2. Could document that `numchars` and `maxlen` must be >= 3 for truncation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code should be fixed to match the documentation, not vice versa
2. The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
3. There's no good reason to require minimum values of 3

## Analysis Summary

The bug report accurately identifies a real issue where:

1. **Contract Violation**: `pretty_print()` explicitly promises to return a string "that is numchars long" but fails to do so for small values of numchars
2. **Reasonable Expectations**: `maybe_truncate()` with `maxlen` parameter should never return strings longer than `maxlen`
3. **Valid Inputs**: The functions accept these small values as parameters without error
4. **Fixable Issue**: The proposed fix is simple and maintains backward compatibility

The core issue is that when truncating with ellipses, the code doesn't handle the case where the desired length is smaller than the ellipsis itself. This is a logic bug, not a documentation issue or feature request.
