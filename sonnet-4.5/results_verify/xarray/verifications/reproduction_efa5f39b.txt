Bug Reproduction Analysis
========================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue affects the `AlwaysGreaterThan` and `AlwaysLessThan` classes in xarray.core.dtypes.

Reproduction Results:
--------------------

For AlwaysGreaterThan:
- Two instances inf1 and inf2 are equal: inf1 == inf2 returns True
- However, inf1 > inf2 incorrectly returns True (should be False when equal)
- This causes inf1 <= inf2 to incorrectly return False (should be True when equal)

For AlwaysLessThan:
- Two instances ninf1 and ninf2 are equal: ninf1 == ninf2 returns True
- However, ninf1 < ninf2 incorrectly returns True (should be False when equal)
- This causes ninf1 >= ninf2 to incorrectly return False (should be True when equal)

The property-based tests fail exactly as described in the bug report.

Root Cause:
----------
The classes are decorated with @functools.total_ordering which generates comparison methods based on the ones provided. However:

- AlwaysGreaterThan.__gt__ unconditionally returns True, even when comparing with another instance of itself
- AlwaysLessThan.__lt__ unconditionally returns True, even when comparing with another instance of itself

This violates the antisymmetry property required for total ordering: when a == b, then a > b must be False and a >= b must be True.

Impact:
------
These classes are used as object-type equivalents to np.inf and -np.inf (as documented in the code comments). The incorrect comparison behavior could lead to:
- Inconsistent sorting results
- Incorrect behavior in algorithms that rely on total ordering
- Violations of mathematical properties expected from infinity representations

The bug is real and reproducible.
