## Documentation Analysis for NamedArray.permute_dims()

### Function Documentation (from source code)

The `permute_dims()` method documentation states:
- **Default behavior**: "By default, reverse the order of the dimensions"
- **Parameters**:
  - `*dim`: Optional dimension order. When not provided, reverses dimensions
  - `missing_dims`: How to handle missing dimensions
- **Returns**: NamedArray with permuted dimensions and data
- **See Also**: References `numpy.transpose`

### NumPy transpose Behavior

According to NumPy documentation:
- `numpy.transpose()` without axes argument "reverses the order of the axes"
- For 2D arrays, this means a standard matrix transpose (rows become columns)
- Example: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` becomes `[[1, 3], [2, 4]]`

### Duplicate Dimensions Warning

The xarray source code explicitly warns about duplicate dimension names (core.py:511-516):
```
"Duplicate dimension names present: dimensions {'x'} appear more than once in dims=('x', 'x').
We do not yet support duplicate dimension names, but we do allow initial construction of the object.
We recommend you rename the dims immediately to become distinct, as most xarray functionality
is likely to fail silently if you do not."
```

Key points:
1. **"We do not yet support duplicate dimension names"** - Explicit acknowledgment of non-support
2. **"most xarray functionality is likely to fail silently"** - Warning about silent failures
3. **"we do allow initial construction"** - The object can be created but may not work correctly

### Documentation Consistency

The documentation for `permute_dims()` does NOT mention:
- Special behavior for duplicate dimension names
- That the transposition might fail with duplicate dimensions
- Any exceptions or limitations regarding dimension names

However, the warning when creating NamedArrays with duplicate dimensions clearly states that functionality will likely "fail silently," which is exactly what happens here.

### Conclusion

The bug report accurately identifies a case where:
1. The documented behavior is to "reverse the order of dimensions" (transpose for 2D)
2. The actual behavior with duplicate dimension names is to return unchanged data
3. This is a "silent failure" as warned about in the duplicate dimensions warning
4. The documentation for `permute_dims()` itself does not mention this limitation

The behavior violates the documented contract of `permute_dims()` which should transpose the underlying data regardless of dimension names, making this a valid bug rather than a documentation issue.
