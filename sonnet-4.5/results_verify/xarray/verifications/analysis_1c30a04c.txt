# Bug Triage Analysis

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Strong Arguments FOR:**
- The function produces NaN values when it should produce values in [0, 1]
- Clear division by zero error that violates basic mathematical principles
- Function's own comment states it should "Scale interval [vmin .. vmax] to [0 .. 1]"
- Reproducible across multiple scenarios (constant arrays, explicit vmin=vmax)
- Affects real-world use cases (displaying solid colors, constant data)
- Python runtime warnings confirm division by zero is occurring
- The proposed fix is reasonable and addresses the root cause

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Function is internal/private (leading underscore), not public API
- No explicit documentation about constant array handling

### INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Function is private/internal, not meant for direct use
- No explicit documentation promises handling of degenerate cases

**Strong Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- Division by zero is universally considered a bug
- Function is used internally by public API (imshow)
- NaN output violates the function's stated purpose

### WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Edge case that might be rare in practice
- Users could work around by avoiding constant arrays

**Strong Arguments AGAINST:**
- Not an obscure edge case - constant arrays are legitimate inputs
- Affects visualization of solid colors or uniform data
- Simple fix available that doesn't break other functionality
- Silent NaN production can cause hard-to-debug downstream failures

### FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that handling vmin=vmax is a new feature
- Original implementation might not have considered this case

**Strong Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Division by zero is a bug, not a missing feature
- Function already claims to scale to [0, 1], which it fails to do

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that function doesn't handle vmin=vmax
- Could add warning about constant arrays

**Strong Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Division by zero is an implementation bug
- Documenting a bug doesn't make it correct behavior

## Analysis Summary

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Mathematical Correctness:** Division by zero is a fundamental programming error
2. **Violated Contract:** Function promises to scale to [0, 1] but produces NaN
3. **Real Impact:** Affects legitimate use cases (solid colors, constant data)
4. **Clear Fix:** Simple check for vmin==vmax before division
5. **Not Edge Case:** Constant arrays are normal inputs for visualization
6. **Silent Failure:** NaN propagation can cause mysterious downstream issues

The fact that it's an internal function doesn't excuse mathematical errors. Internal functions still need to be correct, especially when used by public APIs. The bug report correctly identifies the issue, provides proper reproduction, and suggests a reasonable fix.
