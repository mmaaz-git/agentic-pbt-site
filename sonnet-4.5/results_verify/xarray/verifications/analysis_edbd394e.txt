## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function's type signature explicitly specifies `kind: DTypeLike | tuple[DTypeLike, ...]`, not lists. The NumPy documentation also only mentions tuples, not lists, for multiple kinds. Users passing a list are violating the documented API contract. The function is working exactly as designed - it accepts tuples, not lists. The error occurs because the user is passing an unsupported input type, which is not a bug in the code but a misuse of the API.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The error message "unhashable type: 'list'" is indeed confusing and doesn't directly indicate that lists aren't supported as input. The technical issue described in the bug report is accurate - the code does crash when given a list. The comparison with NumPy 2.0's clearer error message suggests there's room for improvement in error handling.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a fallback implementation for older NumPy versions (< 2.0), which are becoming less common. The issue only affects users who both use NumPy < 2.0 AND incorrectly pass a list instead of a tuple. The workaround is trivial - users just need to use tuples as documented. The error, while confusing, still prevents incorrect usage. Investing effort to improve error messages for a deprecated code path may not be worthwhile.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The error message is genuinely confusing and could waste developers' time debugging. The fix would be simple to implement and would improve user experience. Even if NumPy < 2.0 is older, xarray still supports it and should provide reasonable error messages.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The type annotations already specify that only tuples are accepted, not lists. If users are confused about this, perhaps the documentation could be clearer about the distinction. Adding explicit documentation that lists are not supported could prevent this confusion.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation and type signatures are already clear - they specify tuples, not lists. The issue isn't that the documentation is wrong or unclear, but that the error message when violating the API contract is confusing. This is a code issue, not a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for the function to accept lists in addition to tuples, which is new functionality not currently supported. Lists and tuples are similar sequence types in Python, and supporting both could be seen as a convenience feature. The proposed fix in the bug report adds this new capability by converting lists to tuples.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report frames this as a bug (confusing error message) rather than a request for new functionality. The user isn't asking for lists to be supported as a new feature, but complaining that the current error handling is poor. The comparison with NumPy 2.0 suggests the issue is error messaging, not missing functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The error message "unhashable type: 'list'" is objectively confusing and doesn't help users understand what they did wrong. NumPy 2.0's implementation provides a much clearer error message for the same situation, setting a precedent for what good error handling looks like. The code fails to provide helpful feedback when given invalid input, which could be considered a bug in error handling.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function works correctly for all documented input types. It's not a bug when code fails on invalid input - that's expected behavior. The type signature and documentation clearly specify tuples, not lists. The error, while not ideal, still prevents misuse. Poor error messages alone don't constitute bugs if the function works correctly for valid inputs.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report presents a case where the code technically works as designed but provides a confusing error message when given invalid input. The core question is whether poor error messaging for invalid input constitutes a bug, a minor issue worth fixing, or just expected behavior when violating the API contract.

The type signatures and documentation are clear that tuples, not lists, should be used for multiple kinds. Users passing lists are violating the documented API. However, the error message "unhashable type: 'list'" is genuinely confusing because it doesn't indicate the actual problem - that lists aren't supported as input. The error occurs due to an implementation detail (trying to create a set from a tuple containing a list) rather than explicit input validation.

Given that: (1) the documentation and type signatures are already clear about using tuples, (2) this only affects the fallback implementation for NumPy < 2.0, (3) the error still prevents incorrect usage even if confusingly, and (4) the user is asking for better error handling rather than documenting existing behavior, this appears to be a WONTFIX issue. While the error message could be better, improving error messages for invalid inputs in a legacy fallback implementation is a low-priority enhancement that maintainers would likely decline to address.
