Bug Triage Analysis
===================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that num=1 should work. The default value is 50, and one could argue that the function was never intended to handle such edge cases. The documentation also doesn't explicitly state it must handle all the same cases as numpy.linspace, only that it's "similar to" numpy's function.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function crashes with an unhandled ZeroDivisionError rather than providing a meaningful error. The documentation explicitly states it's "similar to numpy.linspace" which does handle num=1. There's no documented restriction on the minimum value of num, and creating a single-point coordinate is a reasonable use case in scientific computing.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue that num=1 is an obscure edge case that rarely occurs in practice. Most users creating coordinate arrays would use multiple points. The workaround is simple - users can just use endpoint=False or check for num=1 themselves.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The crash is a division by zero error which is a fundamental mathematical error that should be handled. The function claims numpy.linspace similarity, and numpy handles this case. Single-point coordinates are used in scientific computing for degenerate dimensions or placeholder coordinates. The fix is trivial and improves robustness.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the developers intended num=1 to be unsupported, the documentation should explicitly state this restriction. Adding a note that num must be >= 2 when endpoint=True would clarify the API contract.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The crash is clearly a bug in the implementation, not a documentation issue. The code should handle this case rather than documenting around a division by zero error. NumPy's behavior sets a clear precedent for what should happen.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting num=1 could be seen as adding new functionality that wasn't originally designed. The current implementation works for the common cases (num > 1) and adding num=1 support is extending the feature set.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality - it's asking for the function to not crash on valid input. The function already accepts num=1 as a parameter; it just fails to handle it correctly. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new features.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with a ZeroDivisionError on seemingly valid input (num=1 is an integer >= 1). It claims to be "similar to numpy.linspace" which handles this case correctly. The crash is due to a mathematical error in the implementation that doesn't account for the num=1 edge case. The fix is straightforward and the expected behavior is clear from numpy's precedent.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against this being a bug is if the developers explicitly intended to not support num=1, but there's no evidence of this in the documentation or code. Even then, it should raise a meaningful error rather than dividing by zero.

**Overall consideration**
This appears to be a clear BUG. The function accepts num=1 as input but crashes with a ZeroDivisionError when endpoint=True. This is a mathematical error in the implementation that fails to handle an edge case. The function explicitly claims to be "similar to numpy.linspace" in its documentation, and numpy handles num=1 correctly by returning a single point at the start position.

The proposed fix in the bug report is reasonable and matches numpy's behavior. When num=1 with endpoint=True, the single point should be at the start position, just as numpy does. The division by zero occurs because the code tries to calculate spacing for multiple points when there's only one point.

While this might be considered an edge case, it's a valid use case in scientific computing where degenerate dimensions or single-point coordinates are sometimes needed. The crash is unhandled and provides no useful information to users. A proper implementation should either handle this case correctly or raise a meaningful error if num=1 is explicitly unsupported (which it isn't according to the documentation).
