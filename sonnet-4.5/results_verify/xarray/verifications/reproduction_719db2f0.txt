## Reproduction Findings

I have successfully reproduced the behavior described in the bug report. Here are the technical details:

### Test Results

1. **The bug report is technically accurate**: The _icon() function does NOT escape HTML special characters in the icon_name parameter.

2. **Test case with script tags**:
   - Input: `"<script>alert('xss')</script>"`
   - Output: `<svg class='icon xr-<script>alert('xss')</script>'><use xlink:href='#<script>alert('xss')</script>'></use></svg>`
   - The <script> tags are NOT escaped and appear directly in the HTML output

3. **Test case with ampersand**:
   - Input: `"test&name"`
   - Output: `<svg class='icon xr-test&name'><use xlink:href='#test&name'></use></svg>`
   - The ampersand is NOT escaped (should be `&amp;` in valid HTML)

### Comparison with Other Functions

The bug report's claim about inconsistency is correct:

1. **format_dims()** - DOES escape HTML characters using `escape(str(dim))` (line 57)
2. **summarize_attrs()** - DOES escape HTML characters using `escape(str(k))` and `escape(str(v))` (line 66)
3. **summarize_variable()** - DOES escape HTML characters for name, dims, and dtype (lines 84-86)
4. **_icon()** - Does NOT escape HTML characters

### Current Usage

The function is currently only called with these hardcoded strings:
- `_icon("icon-file-text2")` (line 97)
- `_icon("icon-database")` (lines 98, 151, 245)

These are safe icon identifiers that don't contain HTML special characters.

### Technical Impact

1. **No current vulnerability**: Since _icon() is only called with hardcoded strings, there is no actual XSS vulnerability in the current codebase.

2. **Potential future risk**: If someone were to call _icon() with user-controlled input in the future, it would create an XSS vulnerability.

3. **Invalid HTML generation**: Even with safe inputs, if an icon name contained an ampersand, it would generate invalid HTML (unescaped ampersands are not valid in HTML attributes).

The bug report's technical claims are accurate - the function does not escape HTML and is inconsistent with other functions in the same module.
