# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The `collapsible_section` function in xarray has inverted tooltip logic.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Ran the provided hypothesis test - it correctly fails, showing the bug exists
2. Ran the specific reproduction example - output matches exactly what the bug report claims
3. Traced through the logic step-by-step to understand the root cause

## Bug Confirmation
The bug is caused by line 181 overwriting the boolean `enabled` parameter with a string value:
- Line 181: `enabled = "" if enabled and has_items else "disabled"`
- Line 183: `tip = " title='Expand/collapse section'" if enabled else ""`

After line 181, `enabled` becomes either:
- Empty string "" (falsy in Python) for enabled checkboxes
- String "disabled" (truthy in Python) for disabled checkboxes

This causes the tooltip logic on line 183 to be inverted:
- Enabled checkboxes (enabled="") get no tooltip (because "" is falsy)
- Disabled checkboxes (enabled="disabled") get the tooltip (because "disabled" is truthy)

## Impact
This affects real usage. The `dim_section()` function at line 230 calls `collapsible_section` with `enabled=False`, which produces a disabled checkbox with a misleading "Expand/collapse section" tooltip that suggests interaction is possible when it's not.

## Test Results
- Hypothesis test: Fails correctly, identifying the inverted logic
- Manual reproduction: Confirms the exact behavior described in the bug report
- Trace analysis: Confirms the root cause is the variable reassignment issue
