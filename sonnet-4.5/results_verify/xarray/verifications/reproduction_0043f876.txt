## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in xarray.core.utils.OrderedSet.discard().

### Test Results:

1. **Hypothesis Property Test**: FAILED
   - The property-based test immediately found a failing case
   - The test expects discard() to never raise an error, but it does raise KeyError

2. **Direct Reproduction**: CONFIRMED
   - Created OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
   - Called discard(999) where 999 is not in the set
   - Result: Raised KeyError: 999
   - This confirms the bug report's claim

3. **Comparison with built-in set**: BEHAVIOR DIFFERS
   - Python's built-in set.discard(999) on {1, 2, 3} succeeds silently
   - No error is raised when discarding a non-existent element
   - This is the expected behavior per Python's set API

4. **Discard on existing element**: WORKS CORRECTLY
   - OrderedSet.discard(2) on OrderedSet([1, 2, 3]) works fine
   - Element is removed successfully
   - No error is raised when element exists

### Bug Impact:
The bug causes OrderedSet.discard() to raise KeyError when attempting to discard an element that doesn't exist in the set. This violates the expected behavior of the discard() method as defined in Python's MutableSet abstract base class, which should silently do nothing when the element is not present.

### Root Cause:
The implementation at line 599-600 uses `del self._d[value]` which unconditionally attempts to delete the key from the internal dictionary. This raises KeyError if the key doesn't exist, whereas it should use a method that doesn't raise an error for missing keys.
