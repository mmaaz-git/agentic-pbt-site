TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (incorrect report)?
   WHY IT MIGHT BE: The documentation doesn't explicitly specify behavior for mismatched step directions.
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - Negative dimension sizes violate fundamental array constraints
   - The method name "arange" implies NumPy-compatible behavior
   - NumPy consistently returns size 0 for these cases
   - Users reasonably expect non-negative dimension sizes
   VERDICT: Not INVALID - the bug is real and violates reasonable expectations

2. WONTFIX (trivial/uninteresting)?
   WHY IT MIGHT BE: Edge case with incompatible parameters that users shouldn't use.
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - Negative sizes can cause downstream crashes or incorrect results
   - This is a data integrity issue, not just a minor inconvenience
   - Easy to accidentally trigger with dynamic parameter values
   - Simple fix available (max(0, ceil(...)))
   VERDICT: Not WONTFIX - this is a meaningful bug affecting data integrity

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (asking for unsupported functionality)?
   WHY IT MIGHT BE: Could argue that handling mismatched directions is a new feature.
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - The function already accepts these parameter combinations
   - It's not asking for new functionality, but fixing broken existing behavior
   - Returning non-negative sizes is a basic requirement, not a feature
   VERDICT: Not FEATURE_REQUEST - fixing incorrect behavior, not adding features

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (documentation is wrong)?
   WHY IT MIGHT BE: Documentation doesn't specify what happens with mismatched directions.
   WHY IT'S NOT:
   - The code behavior is objectively wrong (negative sizes)
   - Documentation doesn't claim negative sizes are valid
   - The issue is the implementation, not the documentation
   - Even if we added docs saying "returns negative sizes", that would be wrong design
   VERDICT: Not DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the code needs fixing, not the docs

5. BUG (valid bug that should be fixed)?
   WHY IT IS:
   - Creates invalid negative dimension sizes
   - Violates the fundamental constraint that array dimensions must be non-negative
   - Deviates from NumPy's established behavior for the same inputs
   - Has a clear, simple fix that aligns with NumPy's behavior
   - Could cause downstream errors in any code using these indices
   - The proposed fix (max(0, ceil(...))) is correct and minimal
   VERDICT: This is a BUG

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a clear BUG. The function produces invalid negative dimension sizes when step direction doesn't match the start-to-stop direction. This violates fundamental array constraints and deviates from NumPy's behavior. The fix is straightforward and correct.
