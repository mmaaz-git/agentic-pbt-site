## Documentation Findings for xarray.core.formatting_html._icon()

After searching for documentation about the _icon() function:

1. **No public API documentation exists**: The _icon() function is not documented in the public xarray API documentation. It's a private function (indicated by the leading underscore) that is not meant to be part of the public API.

2. **Function comment**: The only documentation is a code comment on line 74 stating: "# icon_name should be defined in xarray/static/html/icon-svg-inline.html". This comment suggests that icon_name should be a predefined icon identifier, not arbitrary user input.

3. **Function signature**: The function accepts a single parameter `icon_name` and returns a string containing SVG HTML markup.

4. **No HTML escaping requirements documented**: There is no documentation stating that the function should or should not escape HTML characters in the icon_name parameter.

5. **Usage context**: The function is only called internally within the same module with hardcoded string literals:
   - Line 97: _icon("icon-file-text2")
   - Line 98: _icon("icon-database")
   - Line 151: _icon("icon-database")
   - Line 245: _icon("icon-database")

6. **Private internal function**: Being a private function (prefixed with underscore), it's not intended for external use and has no contract with external users about HTML escaping behavior.

7. **Related functions**: Other functions in the same module that handle user-provided data DO use html.escape(), but this is not documented as a requirement for _icon() specifically.

Conclusion: The documentation does not specify any HTML escaping requirements for _icon(). The function appears to be designed for internal use with predefined icon names only, not arbitrary user input.
