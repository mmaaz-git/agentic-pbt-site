## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Execution
I successfully reproduced the bug using both the provided test cases:

1. **Basic reproduction case**:
   - Created a CombineKwargDefault object with different old/new values
   - Added it to a set when OPTIONS["use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults"] = False
   - Changed OPTIONS["use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults"] to True
   - The object could no longer be found in the set
   - Hash values: 1789056474547733456 (False) vs 8863897891377406914 (True)

2. **Hypothesis test**:
   - The test failed with the assertion error showing hash instability
   - The hash changed from 1789056474547733456 to 8863897891377406914

### Technical Details Confirmed
- The `_value` property returns 'old_value' when option is False and 'new_value' when option is True
- The `__hash__()` method returns `hash(self._value)`, which changes when _value changes
- Objects remain equal (==) regardless of the option setting, but have different hashes

### Impact Verification
The bug has real impact:
- Objects added to sets/dicts become unfindable after the global option changes
- This violates Python's fundamental hash contract
- Could cause data loss or incorrect program behavior in production code

### Severity Assessment
This is a legitimate bug that violates Python's core data model requirements. The hash of an object must remain constant during its lifetime, but here it changes based on mutable global state.
