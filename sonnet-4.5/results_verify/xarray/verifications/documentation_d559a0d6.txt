## Documentation Analysis

### xarray.corr() Documentation Review

1. **Function Purpose**
   The xarray.corr() function is documented as:
   "Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between two DataArray objects along a shared dimension."

2. **Documentation Findings**
   - The xarray documentation does NOT explicitly state that correlation values must be in the range [-1, 1]
   - The function references "pandas.Series.corr" as corresponding functionality
   - Examples show correlation values like -0.57, 1.0, and -1.0, but no explicit bounds are mentioned
   - No warning about potential floating-point precision issues

3. **Mathematical Definition**
   According to Wikipedia and mathematical references:
   - The Pearson correlation coefficient is MATHEMATICALLY GUARANTEED to be in [-1, 1]
   - Values of ±1 indicate perfect linear relationships
   - This is a fundamental mathematical property, not just a convention
   - The formula is: r = cov(X,Y) / (σ_X * σ_Y)

4. **NumPy Behavior**
   - NumPy's corrcoef() function correctly bounds results to [-1, 1]
   - When tested with the same input, NumPy returns exactly 1.0 (not 1.00000000000000022)
   - NumPy appears to have safeguards against floating-point precision issues

5. **Expected Behavior**
   Even though xarray's documentation doesn't explicitly state the [-1, 1] bound:
   - This is a universally understood mathematical constraint
   - Users have a reasonable expectation that correlation follows mathematical definitions
   - The function name "corr" implies Pearson correlation with its mathematical properties
   - The reference to pandas.Series.corr implies similar behavior

### Conclusion
While the xarray documentation doesn't explicitly state the [-1, 1] constraint, this is a fundamental mathematical property of the Pearson correlation coefficient that users rightfully expect to be honored. The fact that NumPy handles this correctly further reinforces that this is expected behavior in numerical computing libraries.
