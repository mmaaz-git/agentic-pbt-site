## Bug Report Categorization Analysis

### Considering BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. The code explicitly declares `str` and `bytes` as weak scalar types in `is_weak_scalar_type`
2. The function `_future_array_api_result_type` has explicit handling for these types with mappings to "str" and "bytes" dtypes
3. The routing logic incorrectly bypasses this handling when `xp is np`, causing a crash
4. The crash prevents intended functionality from working
5. The fix is straightforward and aligns with the code's clear intent

**Why it might not be a BUG:**
- No counter-arguments found. The code clearly intends to support these types.

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- It could be argued that numpy doesn't support string/bytes in result_type, so the wrapper shouldn't either

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
1. The code explicitly defines these as supported weak scalar types
2. The code has explicit handling for them
3. The function is specifically designed to extend numpy's capabilities for Array API compatibility
4. The implementation clearly shows intent to support these types

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- String and bytes scalars might be considered obscure edge cases

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
1. The code already has explicit support implemented, just incorrectly routed
2. Strings and bytes are explicitly listed as weak scalar types, indicating they're considered important
3. The fix is trivial and doesn't introduce complexity
4. This is not an obscure edge case but a core type in Python

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- There's no user-facing documentation specifying the expected behavior

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The implementation clearly shows the intended behavior
2. The bug is in the code logic, not in documentation
3. The code crashes rather than behaving differently than documented
4. The fix requires code changes, not documentation changes

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue that string/bytes support is a new feature

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. The support is already implemented in `_future_array_api_result_type`
2. The types are already defined as weak scalar types
3. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new functionality
4. The code clearly intends to support these types but has a routing bug

### Conclusion
This is clearly a **BUG**. The code explicitly supports string and bytes as weak scalar types, has implemented handling for them, but a routing error in the `result_type` function prevents this support from working. The function crashes when it should return a valid dtype. The proposed fix correctly addresses the root cause by ensuring string/bytes scalars are routed to the function that handles them.
