## Documentation Findings for CombineKwargDefault Hash Invariant

### CombineKwargDefault Documentation
The class docstring states: "Object that handles deprecation cycle for kwarg default values. Similar to ReprObject"

The class is designed to:
1. Handle deprecation cycles for keyword argument default values
2. Switch between old and new default values based on a global OPTIONS setting
3. Provide utility methods for warning and error messages

No specific documentation exists regarding the hash behavior or requirements for this class.

### Python Hash Invariant Requirements
According to Python's official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__):

1. **Hash consistency requirement**: Objects that are used as dictionary keys or set members must maintain a constant hash value during their lifetime.

2. **Equality-hash relationship**: If two objects compare equal, they must have the same hash value.

3. **Immutability recommendation**: Mutable objects should generally not be hashable, or if they are, the hash should be based only on immutable aspects.

### Current Implementation Analysis
The CombineKwargDefault class implements:
- `__hash__(self) -> int: return hash(self._value)`
- `_value` is a property that returns either `self._new` or `self._old` based on the global `OPTIONS["use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults"]`

This design creates a fundamental conflict with Python's hash invariant because:
- The hash depends on `_value`
- `_value` changes based on a global setting
- This causes the same object to have different hash values at different times

### Documentation Gap
There is no documentation in the CombineKwargDefault class that:
1. Warns users about hash instability
2. Advises against using these objects as dictionary keys or in sets
3. Explains the interaction between the global OPTIONS and hash values

The class appears to be intended primarily for internal use in managing deprecation warnings and defaults, not as general-purpose hashable objects that could be used as dictionary keys.
