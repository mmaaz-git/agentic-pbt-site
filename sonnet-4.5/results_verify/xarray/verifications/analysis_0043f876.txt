## Triage Analysis for OrderedSet.discard() Bug

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug report correctly identifies a violation of the MutableSet contract
- Python's collections.abc explicitly states discard() "Do not raise an exception if absent"
- The behavior difference from built-in set is documented and expected
- The class explicitly inherits from MutableSet and claims to match the builtin set API

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- None. The bug report is factually correct and well-documented.

**Conclusion:** NOT INVALID

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Could argue that users can work around it by checking membership first
- Might claim it's been this way for a long time without complaints

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is a clear violation of a fundamental Python ABC contract
- It breaks the Liskov Substitution Principle
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- It causes unexpected runtime errors in code expecting MutableSet behavior
- Not an obscure edge case - discard() is a core set operation

**Conclusion:** NOT WONTFIX

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that the current behavior is "by design"

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not a request for new functionality
- The class already claims to implement MutableSet
- The documentation says it "matches the builtin set"
- This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

**Conclusion:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Could update docs to say OrderedSet.discard() raises KeyError

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- OrderedSet explicitly inherits from MutableSet which has clear requirements
- The class documentation claims to match builtin set behavior
- Changing documentation would mean OrderedSet is not a proper MutableSet
- The fix to the code is trivial and correct

**Conclusion:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- Clear violation of the MutableSet abstract base class contract
- Behavior differs from Python's built-in set
- The class documentation claims to match the builtin set API
- Causes unexpected KeyError exceptions in valid code
- Breaks Liskov Substitution Principle
- The implementation is objectively wrong (uses del instead of pop)
- The fix is simple and correct
- This is a real issue that would affect users in practice

**Arguments against BUG:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

**Conclusion:** This is a BUG

### Final Assessment
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The OrderedSet class:
1. Inherits from MutableSet, which requires discard() not to raise exceptions
2. Claims to match the builtin set API, which doesn't raise on discard()
3. Uses an incorrect implementation (del) that violates both contracts
4. Has a trivial fix that would bring it into compliance

The bug report is accurate, well-researched, and provides the correct fix.
