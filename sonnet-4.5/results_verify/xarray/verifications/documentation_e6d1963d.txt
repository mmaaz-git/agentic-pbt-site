## Documentation Analysis for CombineKwargDefault

### Class Documentation
The CombineKwargDefault class has minimal documentation - just a brief docstring stating "Object that handles deprecation cycle for kwarg default values. Similar to ReprObject". The class is located in xarray/util/deprecation_helpers.py.

### Python Hash Requirements
According to the official Python documentation:

1. From the Python glossary on "hashable":
   - "An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime"
   - "Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value"

2. From the Python data model documentation on __hash__:
   - "The only required property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash value"
   - Implementation advice: "mix together the hash values of the components of the object that also play a part in comparison of objects"

### Implementation Details
The CombineKwargDefault class:
- Has a `_value` property that returns either `self._new` or `self._old` depending on the global OPTIONS["use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults"] setting
- Implements `__hash__()` as `return hash(self._value)`
- Implements `__eq__()` to compare `self._value` with other objects

### Key Finding
The documentation explicitly states that hash values must never change during an object's lifetime. The current implementation violates this by making the hash dependent on a global mutable option that can change at runtime.

### Purpose of the Class
Based on the code and usage patterns, CombineKwargDefault appears to be a helper class for managing deprecation cycles where default parameter values are changing between versions. It allows xarray to gradually transition from old defaults to new defaults by toggling a global option.
