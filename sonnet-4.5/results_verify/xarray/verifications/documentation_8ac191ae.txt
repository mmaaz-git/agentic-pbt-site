## Documentation Analysis

### Function Nature
- `_nicetitle` is an internal/private function (prefixed with underscore)
- Located in `xarray.plot.facetgrid` module
- Not exposed in public API documentation

### Function Documentation
The only documentation is the docstring:
```python
def _nicetitle(coord, value, maxchar, template):
    """
    Put coord, value in template and truncate at maxchar
    """
```

### Contract Analysis
The docstring states: "Put coord, value in template and truncate at maxchar"

This clearly implies that:
1. The function should format coord and value using the template
2. The result should be truncated at maxchar characters
3. The word "at" in "truncate at maxchar" strongly suggests the output length should not exceed maxchar

### Usage Context
- The function is used internally by FacetGrid.set_titles() method
- Default maxchar value in set_titles() is 30
- The function is called via functools.partial with maxchar parameter
- Used to create subplot titles in faceted plots

### Real-World Impact
- The function is only used internally with default maxchar=30
- In practical usage, maxchar < 3 is extremely unlikely
- The function handles normal cases (maxchar >= 3) correctly
- No public API exposes this function directly

### Key Observations
1. This is an internal function not meant for direct public use
2. The docstring contract is clear about truncating "at maxchar"
3. The implementation violates this contract for edge cases (maxchar < 3)
4. In practical usage with default maxchar=30, this bug would never manifest
5. The bug only occurs in pathological cases that would not make sense for title display
