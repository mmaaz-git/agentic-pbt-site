## Documentation Analysis for xarray.polyval

### XArray Documentation
The xarray.polyval documentation is minimal:
- States it "Evaluate[s] a polynomial at specific values"
- Takes coefficients with a degree dimension
- References numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polyval
- Does NOT specify any restrictions on degree values
- Does NOT mention whether negative degrees are supported or not

### NumPy Documentation Reference
The numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polyval documentation:
- Describes coefficients indexed by degree: "coefficients for terms of degree n are contained in c[n]"
- Shows examples with non-negative degrees only
- Does NOT explicitly forbid negative degrees
- Uses array indexing which naturally starts at 0

### Mathematical Context
Mathematically, there are two types of polynomial-like objects:
1. **Standard Polynomials**: Only non-negative integer powers (0, 1, 2, ...)
2. **Laurent Polynomials**: Allow both positive and negative integer powers

Laurent polynomials are a well-established mathematical concept that extends regular polynomials to include negative degree terms. They form a ring denoted F[X,X⁻¹].

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No explicit degree restrictions**: The xarray documentation doesn't state that degrees must be non-negative
2. **Function accepts negative degrees**: The function allows users to create coefficient arrays with negative degree coordinates
3. **Silent failure**: No documentation warns that negative degrees will be ignored
4. **Integer validation exists**: The function validates that degrees are integers (line 830-833) but doesn't validate non-negativity

### Implications

The documentation is incomplete because:
1. It doesn't specify the supported degree range
2. It allows creation of coefficient arrays with negative degrees without warning
3. It silently drops data rather than raising an error
4. The behavior differs from what a user might reasonably expect given the lack of restrictions

Given that:
- The function accepts negative degree coordinates
- Mathematical precedent exists for negative degrees (Laurent polynomials)
- No documentation forbids negative degrees
- The function silently drops data

This appears to be either:
1. A BUG - the function should handle negative degrees correctly, OR
2. A DOCUMENTATION_FIX - the function should explicitly document that only non-negative degrees are supported and raise an error for negative degrees
