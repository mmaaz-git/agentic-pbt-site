## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The implementation could be argued to be working as designed - it creates evenly spaced values within the interval [start, stop), and the step parameter is just used to determine how many values to create. The internal implementation details of how RangeIndex stores and calculates values might be considered an implementation choice rather than a bug.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states "with spacing between values given by step" which is a clear promise that the step parameter determines the spacing. The documentation also claims similarity to numpy.arange, which preserves the step exactly. The example in the documentation shows step=0.2 producing exactly 0.2 spacing between values. This is not ambiguous - the documentation makes a specific claim that the implementation violates.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This might be considered a design choice where RangeIndex prioritizes even distribution within the given interval over exact step preservation. The implementation consistently produces evenly spaced values, just not with the requested step. For memory efficiency reasons, storing only start, stop, and size might be intentional, and changing this would require storing the actual step value.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it fundamentally changes the behavior of a public API in a way that contradicts its documentation and violates user expectations. The difference between expected and actual values can be significant (e.g., 3.0 vs 2.5, or 0.3 vs 0.25). This affects any code that relies on specific step values, which is a core use case for the arange function.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current implementation has a consistent internal logic - it divides the interval evenly by the calculated number of points. The documentation could be updated to clarify that the step parameter is used to determine the number of points, not the actual spacing. The documentation could explain that RangeIndex.arange behaves differently from numpy.arange in this regard.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation's claim about "spacing between values given by step" and similarity to numpy.arange appears to be the intended design, not a documentation error. The example explicitly shows step preservation. Changing the documentation would be admitting that the API doesn't work as originally intended, which suggests the code is wrong, not the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that preserving the exact step value is a new feature request, and the current implementation is working as designed (even if poorly documented). Adding support for exact step preservation could be seen as an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not asking for new functionality - it's asking for the function to work as documented. The documentation already promises this behavior, so it's not a request for something new but rather a request to fix broken existing functionality.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation explicitly and unambiguously states "with spacing between values given by step" at line 155. The implementation does not honor this - it recalculates the step as (stop - start) / size, which can be significantly different from the provided step. The documentation claims similarity to numpy.arange, but the behavior is fundamentally different. The example in the documentation (lines 190-201) shows exact step preservation, which the implementation doesn't achieve. This is a clear case where the implementation violates the documented API contract.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The implementation is internally consistent and produces valid output - just not the output described in the documentation. One could argue this is more of a design mismatch than a bug, especially if the current behavior was intentional for some reason (like matching the linspace-style internal representation).

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a valid BUG. The documentation makes an explicit, unambiguous promise: "with spacing between values given by step". This is not a vague statement open to interpretation - it clearly states that the step parameter determines the spacing between values. The implementation violates this promise by recalculating the step as (stop - start) / size.

The comparison with numpy.arange strengthens this conclusion. The documentation claims the methods are "similar to numpy.arange", but numpy.arange(0.0, 1.5, 1.0) produces [0.0, 1.0] while RangeIndex.arange(0.0, 1.5, 1.0) produces [0.0, 0.75]. This is not a minor difference - it's a fundamental behavioral difference that would break any code expecting numpy.arange-like behavior.

While one could argue for DOCUMENTATION_FIX, the documentation appears to reflect the intended design (especially given the example showing exact step preservation). The implementation seems to be the part that's incorrect. The bug is objectively demonstrable, reproducible, and violates the documented contract. This should be categorized as BUG.
