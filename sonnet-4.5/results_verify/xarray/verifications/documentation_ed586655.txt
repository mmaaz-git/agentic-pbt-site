DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Function Documentation:
- The _load_static_files() function has a minimal docstring: "Lazily load the resource files into memory the first time they are needed"
- The function is marked as internal (starts with underscore), suggesting it's not part of the public API
- No explicit documentation exists about mutability expectations for this function

Python's lru_cache Documentation:
- According to Python's official documentation, lru_cache should be used "when you want to reuse previously computed values"
- The documentation warns against caching functions that "create distinct mutable objects on each call"
- While not explicitly stated, the implication is that cached functions should return immutable or consistent values

Function Usage:
- The function is used internally in xarray's HTML formatting system
- It's called in _obj_repr() where the results are unpacked: icons_svg, css_style = _load_static_files()
- The function loads static HTML and CSS resources from files for rendering xarray objects in Jupyter notebooks

Key Observations:
1. The function name and docstring clearly indicate the intent is to CACHE static files that don't change
2. The use of @lru_cache(None) indicates unlimited caching - the files should be loaded once and reused
3. The function is internal (_prefixed) so users shouldn't directly call it
4. However, the function returns a mutable list, violating the implicit contract of caching

Documentation Gap:
- There's no explicit documentation stating the function should return immutable data
- However, the function's purpose (loading STATIC files) and use of caching strongly implies immutability
- The Python documentation's warning about "distinct mutable objects" applies here

Conclusion:
While the documentation doesn't explicitly require immutability, the function's design intent (caching static resources), its name (_load_static_files), and Python's lru_cache best practices all strongly indicate that returning a mutable cached object is a bug, not intended behavior.
