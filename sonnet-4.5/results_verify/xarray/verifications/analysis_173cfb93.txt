## Triage Analysis for build_grid_chunks Bug Report

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- Function has no documentation specifying behavior for edge cases
- Could argue that size=0 is an undefined edge case

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The mathematical semantics of partitioning are unambiguous: sum(chunks) must equal size
- The calling function `align_nd_chunks` explicitly validates this invariant and states "This inconsistency should never occur"
- The function name and parameters clearly indicate a partitioning operation
- Even without documentation, a partitioning function that doesn't preserve the total is fundamentally broken

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Could argue size=0 is an obscure edge case that rarely occurs in practice
- Empty arrays might not be common in xarray usage

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The bug violates a fundamental mathematical invariant
- The error will propagate to `align_nd_chunks` which will raise an exception with a confusing error message
- Empty arrays are valid in numpy/xarray and should be handled correctly
- The fix is trivial (one line to check for size=0)

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Function lacks any documentation
- Could document that size=0 is not supported

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The bug is in the code logic, not documentation
- The mathematical semantics are clear even without documentation
- Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it correct
- The calling code expects the invariant to hold

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that handling size=0 is a new feature

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not adding new functionality but fixing broken existing functionality
- The function already attempts to handle all sizes >= 0 (no validation preventing size=0)
- The bug causes incorrect behavior, not missing behavior

### Considering BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Violates fundamental invariant**: The function returns chunks that don't sum to the input size
2. **Breaks caller expectations**: `align_nd_chunks` explicitly validates sum(backend_chunks) == sum(var_chunks)
3. **Clear mathematical semantics**: A partitioning function must preserve the total
4. **Causes downstream errors**: Will cause confusing ValueError in `align_nd_chunks`
5. **Simple logic error**: The code blindly creates initial chunk without checking if size < chunk_size
6. **Valid input rejected**: size=0 is a mathematically valid input for partitioning
7. **Reproducible and deterministic**: The bug occurs consistently for size=0

### Severity Assessment
- **Medium severity** is appropriate:
  - Not a crash or data corruption
  - But violates a fundamental invariant
  - Will cause confusing errors downstream
  - Has a simple fix

### Conclusion
This is unequivocally a **BUG**. The function violates the fundamental mathematical invariant of partitioning (sum of parts equals whole) for the valid input size=0. The calling code explicitly depends on this invariant, and the violation will cause errors downstream. The fix is straightforward and should be implemented.
