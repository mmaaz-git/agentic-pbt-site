Bug Triage Analysis
==================

Evaluating each possible categorization:

BUG (Valid Bug):
----------------
Arguments FOR:
- The classes violate mathematical properties of total ordering
- They are decorated with @functools.total_ordering but don't satisfy its requirements
- The behavior is inconsistent with numpy's inf behavior (np.inf == np.inf is True, np.inf > np.inf is False)
- This could cause real issues in sorting, comparisons, and algorithms
- The fix is straightforward and makes the code mathematically correct
- These classes are meant to represent infinity for object types, and infinity has well-defined comparison semantics

Arguments AGAINST:
- None - this is clearly incorrect behavior

INVALID:
--------
Arguments FOR:
- None - the bug report is accurate and reproducible

Arguments AGAINST:
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The violation of total ordering is demonstrable
- The test cases correctly identify the problem

WONTFIX:
--------
Arguments FOR:
- Could argue these are internal implementation details
- Might not affect real-world usage if never compared to themselves

Arguments AGAINST:
- These are exported as INF and NINF constants that could be used in user code
- The classes fundamentally violate total ordering semantics
- The fix is trivial and has no downsides
- Correctness of basic mathematical operations should be maintained

FEATURE_REQUEST:
----------------
Arguments FOR:
- None - this is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

Arguments AGAINST:
- The current behavior is clearly wrong, not missing
- Total ordering is an existing requirement, not a new feature

DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The code lacks documentation about comparison behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- The issue is not documentation - the code behavior is incorrect
- No reasonable documentation could justify infinity being greater than itself
- The mathematical properties of total ordering are implicit requirements

Conclusion:
----------
This is unquestionably a BUG. The classes violate fundamental mathematical properties that they claim to support (via @functools.total_ordering). The behavior is incorrect regardless of documentation, as these classes represent mathematical infinity which has well-defined comparison semantics. The fix is simple and correct.
