## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `build_grid_chunks` function has **NO docstring** and no explicit documentation. This is an internal function in xarray.backends.chunks module.

### Inferred Purpose from Code Context
Based on the code and its usage:
1. The function generates chunk sizes for grid-based data storage (likely for Zarr backend)
2. It takes a `size` (dimension size), `chunk_size` (desired chunk size), and optional `region` (slice)
3. It returns a tuple of integers representing chunk sizes

### Critical Invariant from Related Code
The `align_nd_chunks` function (lines 20-25) explicitly validates:
```python
if sum(backend_chunks) != sum(var_chunks):
    raise ValueError(
        "The number of elements in the backend does not "
        "match the number of elements in the variable. "
        "This inconsistency should never occur at this stage."
    )
```

This shows that **chunks returned by build_grid_chunks MUST sum to the input size**. The error message states "This inconsistency should never occur at this stage", indicating this is a fundamental invariant.

### Usage Context
- Used in `grid_rechunk` function where it's called with `sum(var_chunks)` as the size parameter
- The resulting chunks are passed to `align_nd_chunks` which validates the sum invariant
- Part of the zarr backend chunking system for xarray

### Test Coverage
Existing tests in test_backends_chunks.py only test cases where size >= chunk_size:
- (10, 3, ...) -> chunks sum to 10
- Never tests size < chunk_size scenarios

### Zarr Documentation Context
From xarray's zarr documentation, chunks are used to partition data for efficient storage and access. The chunks must correctly cover the entire dimension without gaps or overlaps.

### Conclusion
While there's no explicit documentation stating the sum invariant, the code itself enforces this invariant through the ValueError in align_nd_chunks. The comment "This inconsistency should never occur at this stage" makes it clear that build_grid_chunks returning chunks with incorrect sum is a bug, not intended behavior.
