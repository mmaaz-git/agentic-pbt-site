DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. **Function Nature**: `_rescale_imshow_rgb` is an INTERNAL/PRIVATE function (indicated by underscore prefix), not part of the public API. It has no public documentation.

2. **Public API Documentation (imshow)**:
   The public `xarray.plot.imshow` documentation states:
   - "Unlike matplotlib's imshow, xarray will use vmin and vmax for RGB(A) data by applying a single scaling factor and offset to all bands"
   - For numeric data: "vmin, vmax: Values to anchor the colormap"
   - "Passing robust=True infers vmin and vmax [using] 2nd and 98th percentiles"

   However, the documentation DOES NOT specify:
   - What happens when vmin > vmax
   - What happens when vmin == vmax
   - That vmin must be less than vmax

3. **Code Comments**:
   The internal comments in the code (lines 758-759) state:
   "If not robust and one bound is None, calculate the default other bound and check that an interval between them exists."

   This comment indicates the INTENT to validate that an interval exists, but this is only implemented for cases where one parameter is None.

4. **Mathematical Expectations**:
   The formula used is: `(darray - vmin) / (vmax - vmin)`
   - This is a standard linear rescaling formula that maps [vmin, vmax] to [0, 1]
   - Mathematically, this requires vmin < vmax for proper scaling
   - When vmin >= vmax, the formula produces undefined or inverted results

5. **Implicit Requirements**:
   While not explicitly documented, the concept of "min" and "max" inherently implies min < max. The variable names themselves (vmin/vmax) establish this expectation.

6. **Consistency Analysis**:
   The code already validates vmin < vmax in two scenarios:
   - When vmax is None: validates vmin < default_vmax
   - When vmin is None: validates default_vmin < vmax

   This establishes a clear pattern that vmin < vmax is required, making the lack of validation when both are provided inconsistent.

CONCLUSION: The documentation does not explicitly state that vmin must be less than vmax, but the mathematical nature of the operation, the variable naming convention, and the existing validation in partial cases all strongly indicate this is a requirement that should be enforced.
