## Bug Reproduction Summary

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in xarray's `NamedArray.permute_dims()` method.

### Test Results

1. **Simple Example Reproduction**: CONFIRMED
   - Created a 2x2 array with duplicate dimension names ("x", "x")
   - Original array: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
   - After calling `permute_dims()`: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] (unchanged)
   - Expected (transposed): [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
   - Result: The array was NOT transposed and returned unchanged

2. **Property-Based Testing**: CONFIRMED
   - Hypothesis testing with various array sizes (2-5 dimensions)
   - Test failed on multiple inputs (e.g., 2x3 and 2x2 arrays)
   - All failures show the same pattern: the array is not transposed when dimensions have duplicate names

### Root Cause Verification

The issue is in line 1043 of `/home/npc/miniconda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray/namedarray/core.py`:

```python
if len(dims) < 2 or dims == self.dims:
    return self.copy(deep=False)
```

When dimension names are duplicates like `('x', 'x')`:
1. The method reverses the dimensions: `('x', 'x')[::-1]` = `('x', 'x')`
2. Since the reversed dims equal the original dims, the code returns an unchanged copy
3. The actual array data is never transposed

### Key Observations

The code correctly generates a UserWarning when creating NamedArrays with duplicate dimension names, stating:
- "We do not yet support duplicate dimension names"
- "most xarray functionality is likely to fail silently if you do not [rename dimensions]"

This bug is indeed a manifestation of the "silent failure" that the warning mentions. The `permute_dims()` method fails silently by returning an untransposed array when it should transpose the underlying data regardless of dimension names.
