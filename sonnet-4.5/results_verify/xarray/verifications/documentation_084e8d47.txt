DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. XARRAY RANGEINDEX.ARANGE DOCUMENTATION:
   - The method docstring specifies it creates a RangeIndex from start/stop/step values
   - Documentation says: "End of interval. In general the interval does not include this value"
   - No explicit mention of how to handle incompatible step directions
   - The method aims to mimic NumPy's arange behavior (evident from the name and parameters)

2. NUMPY ARANGE DOCUMENTATION:
   - NumPy's documentation doesn't explicitly document the behavior for mismatched step directions
   - However, NumPy's actual behavior is consistent: it returns empty arrays
   - This is a well-established convention in NumPy that users rely on

3. IMPLICIT BEHAVIORAL CONTRACT:
   - The method name "arange" strongly suggests NumPy-compatible behavior
   - Users would reasonably expect xarray.RangeIndex.arange to behave like np.arange
   - NumPy's behavior (returning empty array for incompatible directions) is the de facto standard

4. DIMENSION SIZE CONSTRAINTS:
   - It's a fundamental constraint in array libraries that dimension sizes must be non-negative
   - Negative sizes violate basic array semantics
   - No documentation suggests negative sizes are acceptable or meaningful

5. CONCLUSION ON DOCUMENTATION:
   - While not explicitly documented, the expected behavior is clear from:
     a) The method name matching NumPy's arange
     b) Universal constraint that dimension sizes must be non-negative
     c) NumPy's established behavior as the reference implementation
   - The current behavior (negative sizes) contradicts reasonable user expectations
   - This is NOT a documentation issue - the code behavior is incorrect
