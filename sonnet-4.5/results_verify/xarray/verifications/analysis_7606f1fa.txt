## Bug Triage Analysis

Let me evaluate this bug report against each possible categorization:

### 1. INVALID - Why it might be / Why it's not

**Might be INVALID if:**
- The behavior was intentionally designed this way
- The documentation is wrong about the intended behavior
- There's some ambiguity about what "ignore missing dimensions" means

**NOT INVALID because:**
- The documentation is crystal clear about the expected behavior
- The `drop_missing_dims` function correctly implements the filtering logic
- The error occurs in a validation check that doesn't consider the `missing_dims` parameter
- The test cases demonstrate reasonable expectations that match the documentation

### 2. WONTFIX - Why it might be / Why it's not

**Might be WONTFIX if:**
- This is an obscure edge case that rarely occurs in practice
- The workaround (using ellipsis) is sufficient
- The fix might break other functionality

**NOT WONTFIX because:**
- The `missing_dims` parameter exists specifically to handle this use case
- This is a documented feature that doesn't work as advertised
- Users explicitly setting `missing_dims='ignore'` have clear intent
- The fix is straightforward and localized (as shown in the bug report)

### 3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be / Why it's not

**Might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX if:**
- The code's behavior is correct and the documentation is misleading
- The feature was never meant to work this way

**NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX because:**
- The documentation matches similar functions (like DataArray.transpose)
- The `drop_missing_dims` helper function works correctly according to the docs
- The issue is clearly in the validation logic, not the documentation
- Changing the documentation would make the `missing_dims` parameter meaningless

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be / Why it's not

**Might be FEATURE_REQUEST if:**
- This capability was never implemented
- The parameter exists but was never meant to handle this case

**NOT FEATURE_REQUEST because:**
- The parameter already exists with clear documentation
- The filtering logic is already implemented in `drop_missing_dims`
- The bug is in the validation logic that runs after filtering
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities

### 5. BUG - Why it is / Why it might not be

**IS A BUG because:**
- There's a clear discrepancy between documented and actual behavior
- The `missing_dims` parameter doesn't work for its stated purpose
- The code raises an exception when it should handle missing dimensions gracefully
- The validation check on line 172 of utils.py doesn't account for the `missing_dims` setting
- The suggested fix is logical: skip the strict permutation check when `missing_dims != 'raise'`

**NOT A BUG if:**
- (No valid reasons found - this is clearly a bug)

### Conclusion

This is a legitimate **BUG**. The code fails to implement the documented behavior of the `missing_dims` parameter. The validation logic incorrectly enforces a complete permutation requirement even when the user has explicitly requested to ignore or warn about missing dimensions. The fix suggested in the bug report is appropriate and addresses the root cause.
