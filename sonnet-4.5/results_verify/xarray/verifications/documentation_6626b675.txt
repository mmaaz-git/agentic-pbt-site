## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation

The `_deprecate_positional_args` function includes internal documentation (docstring):

```python
"""Decorator for methods that issues warnings for positional arguments

Using the keyword-only argument syntax in pep 3102, arguments after the
``*`` will issue a warning when passed as a positional argument.
```

Key points from the docstring:
1. The function is designed to issue warnings, not errors
2. It's meant to work with PEP 3102 keyword-only argument syntax
3. Example shows it should convert positional args to keyword args

### Expected Behavior from Documentation

The documentation states the decorator should:
1. Issue a warning when positional arguments are used for keyword-only parameters
2. Still execute the function (by converting positional to keyword args)
3. Provide a deprecation path for transitioning to keyword-only arguments

### What Documentation Does NOT Specify

The documentation does not explicitly state what should happen when:
1. Too many positional arguments are provided (more than the function can accept)
2. The number of excess positional arguments exceeds the number of keyword-only parameters

### Related Context

1. **From scikit-learn (origin of the code)**: The pattern is meant to provide a gradual transition, warning users but not breaking their code immediately.

2. **From xarray's usage**: The decorator is used internally to deprecate positional arguments across various methods, as part of a broader API standardization effort.

3. **Python's Standard Behavior**: When a function receives too many positional arguments, Python raises a `TypeError` with a clear message like "func() takes X positional arguments but Y were given"

### Documentation Assessment

The documentation doesn't explicitly specify the behavior for excess positional arguments beyond what the function can handle. However:

1. The decorator is described as issuing "warnings" not "errors"
2. The purpose is to provide a deprecation path, not to change error behavior
3. A reasonable interpretation is that the decorator should preserve Python's standard error behavior for invalid function calls

The current implementation violates the principle of least surprise by:
- Replacing Python's clear `TypeError` with an obscure `ValueError` about zip arguments
- Changing the error type and message for a case that should fail regardless of the deprecation

### Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state how to handle excess arguments, the decorator's purpose (deprecation warnings) and the principle of preserving standard Python behavior suggest that the current `ValueError` is unintended behavior. The decorator should not interfere with Python's normal error handling for genuinely invalid function calls.
