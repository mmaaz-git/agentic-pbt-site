## Bug Reproduction Results

### Summary
The bug report is technically correct. The `pretty_print` function does not honor its documented contract for small values of `numchars` (1 and 2).

### Test Results

#### For `numchars=1`:
- Input: `obj='test'`, `numchars=1`
- Expected output length: 1
- Actual output: `'te...'`
- Actual output length: 5
- **FAIL**: Contract violation

#### For `numchars=2`:
- Input: `obj='test'`, `numchars=2`
- Expected output length: 2
- Actual output: `'tes...'`
- Actual output length: 6
- **FAIL**: Contract violation

#### For `numchars >= 3`:
- All tests pass correctly
- The function correctly returns strings of exactly `numchars` length

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue is in the `maybe_truncate` function:
```python
def maybe_truncate(obj, maxlen=500):
    s = str(obj)
    if len(s) > maxlen:
        s = s[: (maxlen - 3)] + "..."
    return s
```

When `maxlen` is 1 or 2:
- For `maxlen=1`: It tries to take `s[:(1-3)]` = `s[:-2]` = `'te'` and adds `'...'`, resulting in `'te...'` (5 chars)
- For `maxlen=2`: It tries to take `s[:(2-3)]` = `s[:-1]` = `'tes'` and adds `'...'`, resulting in `'tes...'` (6 chars)

The function unconditionally appends "..." (3 characters) when truncating, which causes the output to exceed the requested length when `maxlen < 3`.

### Hypothesis Test Confirmation
The hypothesis test immediately fails on `numchars=1`, confirming the bug exists.

### Technical Details
1. The bug is deterministic and reproducible
2. It only affects cases where `numchars < 3` and the input string length > `numchars`
3. The proposed fix in the bug report would address this issue by checking if `maxlen < 3` and handling it specially
4. This is an edge case that likely doesn't occur often in practice since typical formatting uses much larger `numchars` values

### Usage Context
Looking at the codebase, `pretty_print` is primarily used internally within xarray's formatting system:
- Used in `summarize_attr` with default widths from display options (typically 80+ chars)
- Used in formatting various repr methods with column widths calculated to be at least 7+6=13 chars
- The edge case of `numchars` being 1 or 2 is unlikely to occur in normal xarray usage
