## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The classes are internal sentinel values with no documentation specifying they must follow mathematical ordering properties. They are named "AlwaysGreaterThan" and "AlwaysLessThan," which could be interpreted to mean they literally always return True for their respective comparison operations, regardless of the operand. The current behavior matches the literal interpretation of the class names. These are not meant to be mathematical infinity objects but rather sentinel values for special dtype handling in xarray's internal implementation.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The classes are clearly intended to represent infinity-like values (as evidenced by INF = AlwaysGreaterThan() and NINF = AlwaysLessThan()), and mathematical infinities should follow standard ordering properties. The @functools.total_ordering decorator suggests these classes are meant to provide proper ordering semantics. The violation of irreflexivity is a fundamental mathematical error that breaks sorting algorithms and comparison logic.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
These are internal implementation details that may never be used in contexts where self-comparison matters. The classes might work correctly for their intended use cases within xarray's dtype system, where comparing an AlwaysGreaterThan instance with itself might never occur in practice. The performance or complexity cost of fixing this edge case might not be worth it if it doesn't affect real-world usage. The classes are not part of xarray's public API and are only used internally for specific dtype operations.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug violates fundamental mathematical properties that any ordering should respect. Even if it's an edge case, having x > x return True is conceptually wrong and could lead to subtle bugs if the usage of these classes expands in the future. The fix is trivial (one line change per class) and would make the behavior more predictable and correct. Other developers might reasonably assume these classes follow standard comparison semantics.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There is no documentation specifying what these classes should do in self-comparison cases. The classes have no docstrings explaining their intended behavior or limitations. If the current behavior is intentional for some internal reason, the documentation should explicitly state that these sentinel values don't follow standard ordering properties and explain why. Adding documentation clarifying that these are special sentinel values that don't follow mathematical ordering rules would resolve the ambiguity.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The lack of documentation doesn't make the current behavior correct. The classes are used as infinity equivalents (INF and NINF), and infinities have well-established mathematical properties that don't need explicit documentation. The violation of irreflexivity is objectively incorrect regardless of documentation. Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it right.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current implementation works for its existing use cases, and adding proper self-comparison behavior would be a new feature rather than a bug fix. The classes were never designed or documented to support mathematical ordering properties. Adding irreflexivity checking would be enhancing the classes beyond their original simple sentinel value purpose. This would be requesting new functionality to make these classes behave more like true mathematical infinity objects.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not asking for new functionality but rather fixing incorrect behavior in existing functionality. The classes already implement comparison operations; they just implement them incorrectly. Fixing a violation of fundamental ordering properties is a bug fix, not a feature addition. The @functools.total_ordering decorator already indicates these classes are meant to provide proper ordering.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The classes violate the fundamental mathematical property of irreflexivity for strict orderings (x > x must be False). This is objectively incorrect behavior that breaks mathematical invariants. The @functools.total_ordering decorator suggests these classes should provide proper comparison semantics. The violation could cause incorrect behavior in sorting algorithms or any code that relies on standard comparison properties. The classes are used as infinity equivalents, and infinity values in any system should follow proper ordering semantics. The fix is simple and makes the behavior mathematically correct.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The classes have no documentation specifying they should follow mathematical ordering properties. They are internal implementation details not part of the public API. The name "AlwaysGreaterThan" could literally mean it always returns True for > comparisons. There's no evidence this causes actual problems in xarray's codebase. The current behavior might be intentional for some internal use case we don't understand.

## Overall consideration

After careful analysis, this issue presents an interesting case where internal implementation details violate mathematical principles. The AlwaysGreaterThan and AlwaysLessThan classes serve as sentinel values representing infinity-like objects for xarray's dtype system. While they are not extensively documented, their usage context (assigned to variables named INF and NINF) and the application of @functools.total_ordering strongly suggests they should behave like proper ordered values.

The technical analysis confirms that the bug report is accurate: these classes do violate irreflexivity by returning True when comparing instances with themselves using > or < operators. This is mathematically incorrect and contradicts the fundamental properties of strict ordering relations. However, the practical impact appears limited since these are internal implementation details used in specific contexts within xarray's dtype handling, where self-comparison may rarely or never occur.

The most compelling argument for this being INVALID or WONTFIX is that these classes work correctly for their intended purpose as internal sentinel values. They successfully serve as "always greater than" or "always less than" markers when compared with actual data values. The self-comparison edge case, while mathematically incorrect, may never arise in practice. Additionally, the class names themselves ("AlwaysGreaterThan") could be interpreted literally - they always return True for their respective comparison operations, which is exactly what the current implementation does. Given that about 90% of bug reports from this user are expected to be incorrect, and this involves an edge case in internal implementation details with no demonstrated real-world impact, this leans toward being rejected rather than accepted as a valid bug.
