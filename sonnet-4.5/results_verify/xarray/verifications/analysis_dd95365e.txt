BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID (Code is correct as designed):
   AGAINST:
   - The parameter name "n_items" semantically means "number of items"
   - Numbers of items cannot be negative in any meaningful context
   - All actual usage in codebase uses len() which never returns negative
   - Displaying "(-5)" in UI makes no semantic sense
   - The function's purpose is to show/hide sections based on item count

   FOR:
   - No explicit documentation forbids negative values
   - Python allows negative integers as truthy values
   - Function technically "works" with negative values

   VERDICT: Unlikely to be INVALID - semantic meaning is clear

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
   AGAINST:
   - The bug causes incorrect UI behavior (sections expanded when empty)
   - Could confuse users if ever encountered
   - Fix is trivial (one line change)
   - Proper input validation is good software practice

   FOR:
   - Bug never occurs in actual codebase usage (always from len())
   - Extremely unlikely to affect real users
   - No reports of this issue in production
   - Function is internal, not part of public API

   VERDICT: Possible WONTFIX - edge case that doesn't occur naturally

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality):
   AGAINST:
   - Not asking for new functionality
   - Bug report shows existing functionality behaves incorrectly
   - The fix corrects logic, doesn't add features

   FOR:
   - Could argue input validation is a "new feature"
   - Original design didn't consider negative inputs

   VERDICT: Unlikely - this is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding features

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Docs need updating):
   AGAINST:
   - The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
   - Even without docs, semantic meaning is clear
   - Fix should be in code, not documentation

   FOR:
   - Could document that negative values are treated as truthy
   - Could add parameter validation requirements to docs

   VERDICT: Unlikely - the code logic is flawed, not documentation

5. BUG (Valid bug to fix):
   FOR:
   - Function produces semantically incorrect output with negative inputs
   - Displays meaningless "(-5)" in UI
   - Sections are expanded when they should be disabled
   - Violates principle of least surprise
   - Easy fix improves code robustness
   - Proper input handling is good practice

   AGAINST:
   - Never occurs in actual usage (always from len())
   - Not documented as forbidden behavior
   - Low severity, no user impact

   VERDICT: Most likely BUG - incorrect behavior that should be fixed

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
----------------

This is either a BUG or WONTFIX, depending on philosophy:

As BUG:
- The function behaves incorrectly for semantically invalid inputs
- Negative item counts are meaningless
- The fix is trivial and improves robustness
- Good software should handle edge cases properly

As WONTFIX:
- The bug never occurs in practice
- All real usage comes from len() which is never negative
- Function is internal, not public API
- Extremely low impact

Given that:
1. The semantic meaning of n_items is clear (count of items)
2. The function produces incorrect UI behavior with negative values
3. The fix is trivial and improves code quality
4. Proper input handling is a best practice

Recommendation: BUG (though low severity)
