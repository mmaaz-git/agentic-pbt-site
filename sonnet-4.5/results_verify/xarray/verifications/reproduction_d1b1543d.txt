Bug Reproduction Results
========================

The bug has been successfully reproduced. The xarray.cov function produces mathematically incorrect results when ddof >= valid_count.

Test Results:
1. Hypothesis property-based test: FAILED
   - The test failed with 2 distinct failures when testing edge cases with ddof >= data length

2. Specific test cases:
   - xarray.cov([1.0], ddof=1): Returns nan (not consistent)
   - xarray.cov([1.0, 2.0], ddof=2): Returns inf (problematic)
   - xarray.cov([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], ddof=5): Returns -1.0 (mathematically incorrect - variance cannot be negative)

3. Comparison with NumPy behavior:
   - NumPy consistently returns inf for all cases where ddof >= data length
   - NumPy also issues a RuntimeWarning: "Degrees of freedom <= 0 for slice"
   - NumPy never returns negative values for variance/covariance

Key Issues Identified:
1. xarray returns negative values (e.g., -1.0) when ddof > valid_count, which is mathematically incorrect as covariance should never be negative when computing self-covariance
2. xarray's behavior is inconsistent (sometimes nan, sometimes inf, sometimes negative)
3. No warning is issued to users about insufficient degrees of freedom

The bug occurs in the code at line 298 of computation.py:
```python
adjust = valid_count / (valid_count - ddof)
```

When valid_count == ddof, this causes division by zero (inf)
When valid_count < ddof, this results in a negative adjustment factor, leading to negative covariance values
