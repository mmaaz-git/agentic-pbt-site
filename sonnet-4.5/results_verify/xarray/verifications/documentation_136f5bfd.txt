## Documentation Analysis

### xarray RangeIndex.linspace Documentation

The documentation for `xarray.indexes.RangeIndex.linspace` states:

**Purpose:** "Create a new RangeIndex from given start / stop values and number of values."

**Parameters:**
- `num`: Number of values in the interval, i.e., dimension size (default: 50)
- `endpoint`: If True (default), the stop value is included in the interval

**Key observations:**
1. The documentation does NOT explicitly state what should happen when `num=1`
2. The documentation does NOT mention any special handling for edge cases
3. The documentation does NOT explicitly state it should behave like NumPy's linspace

However, there are strong implicit expectations:

### Implicit Behavioral Expectations

1. **Naming Convention:** The method is named `linspace`, which is the same name as NumPy's function. This creates a reasonable expectation of similar behavior.

2. **Purpose Alignment:** Both functions serve the same purpose - creating linearly spaced values between start and stop.

3. **Parameter Consistency:** The parameters (start, stop, num, endpoint) match NumPy's linspace signature, further reinforcing the expectation of similar behavior.

### NumPy's linspace Behavior

NumPy's `linspace` documentation doesn't explicitly describe `num=1` behavior either, but the function works correctly:
- When `num=1` and `endpoint=True`: Returns the start value
- No division by zero error occurs

### Conclusion

While the documentation doesn't explicitly specify the behavior for `num=1`, there is a reasonable expectation that:
1. The function should not crash with a division by zero error
2. It should handle the edge case gracefully, likely returning a single value
3. Given the naming and parameter similarity to NumPy's linspace, users would expect similar behavior

The lack of explicit documentation about edge cases does not excuse a crash. A function that accepts `num` as a positive integer (including 1) should handle all valid inputs without crashing.
