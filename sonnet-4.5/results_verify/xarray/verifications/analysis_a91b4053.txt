## Bug Report Analysis - Categorization Considerations

### BUG (Valid Bug Report) - Strong Evidence
1. **Violates Python's Core Contract**: The hash changes during object lifetime, breaking a fundamental Python invariant
2. **Real-World Impact**: Objects become unretrievable from sets/dicts after OPTIONS changes
3. **Reproducible**: 100% reproducible with provided test cases
4. **Correctness Issue**: The implementation is objectively incorrect according to Python's data model
5. **Fix is Clear**: The suggested fix (hashing immutable attributes) is the standard Python approach

### INVALID - Weak Arguments Against
1. Could argue the class wasn't intended for use in sets/dicts - BUT: The presence of __hash__ implies it should be usable as such
2. Could claim it's expected behavior - BUT: No reasonable developer would expect hash values to change

### WONTFIX - Very Weak Arguments
1. Might be considered an edge case - BUT: It's a fundamental correctness issue, not an obscure edge case
2. Could claim it's working as designed - BUT: The design violates Python's core contracts

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Not Applicable
1. This isn't a documentation issue - the code is fundamentally broken
2. No amount of documentation would make changing hash values acceptable

### FEATURE_REQUEST - Not Applicable
1. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
2. Having stable hashes is not a new feature but a basic requirement

## Severity Assessment
This is a HIGH severity bug because:
1. It violates fundamental Python invariants
2. Can cause silent data corruption (lost objects in containers)
3. Breaks standard Python programming assumptions
4. The fix is straightforward and low-risk

## Recommendation
This should be categorized as **BUG**. The implementation is objectively incorrect and violates Python's fundamental hash contract. The suggested fix (hashing the tuple of immutable attributes) is the correct approach and should be implemented.
