## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test using Hypothesis fails immediately with simple inputs:
- name='0', old='', new=None
- The hash value changes from 0 to 4238894112 back to 0 depending on the OPTIONS state
- The test reliably fails for any case where old != new

### Manual Reproduction Results
Using the provided example code:
- Created a CombineKwargDefault object with name="test", old="old_val", new="new_val"
- Initial hash: -698507152136368438
- Hash after set_options(use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults=True): 8985409324238247988
- The hashes are clearly different
- When the object is placed in a set, it cannot be found after OPTIONS changes (returns False)

### Root Cause Confirmed
The issue is exactly as described in the bug report:
1. The __hash__ method returns hash(self._value)
2. self._value is a property that returns either self._new or self._old based on OPTIONS["use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults"]
3. When OPTIONS changes, _value changes, causing the hash to change
4. This violates Python's fundamental hash invariant

### Impact Verification
The bug has real consequences:
- Objects placed in sets become unretrievable after OPTIONS changes
- Dictionary keys using these objects would similarly fail
- Any hash-based container would exhibit undefined behavior

The bug is 100% reproducible and matches the report's description exactly.
