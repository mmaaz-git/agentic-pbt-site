DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR LRUCache.__delitem__ Thread-Safety
==============================================================

1. CLASS DOCUMENTATION:
The LRUCache class has explicit documentation about thread-safety in its docstring (line 13 of lru_cache.py):
"Thread-safe LRUCache based on an OrderedDict."

This is an unambiguous claim that the class is thread-safe. The documentation does not qualify this statement with any limitations or exceptions.

2. ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION:
- The class docstring further states (lines 15-18): "All dict operations (__getitem__, __setitem__, __contains__) update the priority of the relevant key and take O(1) time."
- While this mentions specific operations, it doesn't explicitly exclude __delitem__ from thread-safety guarantees.
- The general statement "Thread-safe LRUCache" implies ALL operations should be thread-safe.

3. EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION:
- Searched for xarray documentation online but found no specific API documentation about the LRUCache class
- The class appears to be an internal implementation detail for backend caching
- No external specifications or RFCs apply to this implementation

4. PYTHON ORDEREDDICT DOCUMENTATION:
- Python's OrderedDict (which LRUCache uses internally) is NOT thread-safe by default
- The Python documentation states that dictionary operations require external synchronization for thread-safety
- This reinforces that LRUCache must provide its own locking mechanism

5. IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:
The class creates a threading.RLock in __init__ (line 50) specifically for thread-safety:
self._lock = threading.RLock()

This lock is consistently used in:
- __getitem__ (line 55): with self._lock
- __setitem__ (line 68): with self._lock
- maxsize.setter (line 102): with self._lock

6. CONCLUSION ON DOCUMENTATION:
The documentation explicitly promises thread-safety for the entire LRUCache class. There are no caveats, exceptions, or limitations mentioned. The class name itself and its docstring make an unqualified claim of thread-safety. The presence of a lock and its use in other methods demonstrates that thread-safety was a deliberate design goal.
