## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function violates a fundamental mathematical invariant: chunks must partition the data dimension
- When size < chunk_size, sum(chunks) > size, which is mathematically impossible
- This would cause real issues in production:
  - Incorrect memory allocation
  - Out-of-bounds access attempts
  - Data corruption in Zarr storage
- The bug is reproducible and consistent
- The proposed fix is reasonable and correct

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug.

### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The test clearly demonstrates the bug
- The mathematical invariant violation is undeniable
- sum((2, 1)) = 3 when size = 1 is objectively wrong

### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that size < chunk_size is an edge case
- The function is internal and not part of public API

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Small arrays are common in real-world data processing
- Internal functions still need to be correct
- This bug could cause data corruption in Zarr storage
- The fix is simple and low-risk
- Other parts of the codebase depend on this invariant

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Capability)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The expected behavior (sum equals size) is fundamental.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Partitioning data correctly is not a "feature", it's the core functionality
- The function already attempts to handle this case but does it incorrectly

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function has no documentation specifying behavior
- Could argue behavior is "undefined" for size < chunk_size

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Mathematical invariants don't need documentation to be true
- The function name "build_grid_chunks" implies it builds chunks that partition the grid
- The usage context (sum(var_chunks) passed as size) makes the requirement clear
- No reasonable interpretation would allow sum(chunks) > size

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** - a clear logic error that violates fundamental mathematical properties.

### Reasoning:
1. **Mathematical Invariant Violation**: Chunks are meant to partition a dimension. Having sum(chunks) > size violates the definition of partitioning.

2. **Real-World Impact**: This affects users working with small arrays or dimensions smaller than chunk sizes, which is common in:
   - Testing environments
   - Small datasets
   - Edge regions of larger datasets
   - Streaming data with variable batch sizes

3. **Clear Fix Available**: The proposed fix (`min(chunk_size - (region_start % chunk_size), size)`) correctly ensures the first chunk doesn't exceed the total size.

4. **Not a Documentation Issue**: Even without documentation, the requirement that chunks sum to the total size is self-evident from the function's purpose and usage.

5. **Not an Edge Case**: The tests provided show this fails for multiple size/chunk_size combinations where size < chunk_size.

The bug should be filed and fixed as it represents a fundamental correctness issue in the chunking algorithm.
