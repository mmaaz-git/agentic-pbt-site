## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Arguments for:**
- The forward/reverse round-trip property is violated when start == stop
- Division by zero causes NaN to be returned instead of valid positions
- The CoordinateTransform base class documentation implies forward and reverse should be inverse operations
- A constant coordinate (where all positions map to the same value) is a valid mathematical concept that should be handled
- The bug is easily reproducible and affects a public API

**Arguments against:**
- None - this is clearly incorrect behavior

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments for:**
- Could argue that start == stop is an edge case that shouldn't be supported

**Arguments against:**
- There's no documentation saying start == stop is invalid
- The constructor accepts start == stop without error
- Mathematically, a constant coordinate transform is valid
- The code already handles size=0 edge case (returning step=1.0), showing edge cases are considered

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments for:**
- Could be considered an obscure edge case (constant coordinates)

**Arguments against:**
- Not that obscure - constant coordinates can occur in real data
- The fix is simple and doesn't complicate the code
- The bug causes a RuntimeWarning and NaN values, which is user-visible

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments for:**
- Could document that start must not equal stop

**Arguments against:**
- The current behavior (returning NaN) is clearly wrong
- A constant coordinate is mathematically valid
- Documenting a restriction would be worse than fixing the bug

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments for:**
- Could claim that supporting constant coordinates is a new feature

**Arguments against:**
- The class already accepts start == stop in the constructor
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The forward() method already works correctly with step=0

### Analysis Summary:
This is a clear BUG. The RangeCoordinateTransform.reverse() method fails with division by zero when start == stop, violating the expected inverse relationship between forward and reverse transformations. The bug produces NaN values and RuntimeWarnings, breaking the documented contract that these methods should be inverses of each other.

The proposed fix is reasonable: when step=0 (constant coordinate), reverse() should return zeros for all positions since all grid positions map to the same coordinate value. This maintains the round-trip property while handling the edge case correctly.
