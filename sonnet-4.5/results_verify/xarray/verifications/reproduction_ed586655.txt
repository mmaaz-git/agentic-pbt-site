REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug in xarray.core.formatting_html._load_static_files().

Test Results:
1. Manual Reproduction: CONFIRMED
   - The function returns a mutable list (type: <class 'list'>)
   - Contains 2 elements (static HTML and CSS resources)
   - When we modify the returned list (e.g., original[0] = "CORRUPTED"), the modification persists
   - Subsequent calls to _load_static_files() return the corrupted cached value
   - This confirms the cache can be mutated by callers

2. Hypothesis Test: CONFIRMED
   - The property-based test fails as expected
   - Any text value causes the test to fail
   - The test correctly identifies that the cache gets corrupted when the returned list is modified

Effect of the Bug:
- The function uses @lru_cache(None) decorator for caching
- It returns a mutable list containing static HTML/CSS resources for xarray's HTML formatting
- Because the list is mutable and the same object is returned from cache, any caller can modify it
- This modification affects ALL subsequent callers until the cache is cleared
- In production, this could break HTML visualizations in Jupyter notebooks if any code accidentally modifies the returned list
- The bug violates the principle of immutability for cached values

The bug report accurately describes the issue and provides working reproduction code.
