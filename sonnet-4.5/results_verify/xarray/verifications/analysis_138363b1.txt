TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Consideration for Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it MIGHT be a BUG:**
- The function already validates vmin < vmax when one parameter is None, establishing a clear requirement
- The mathematical formula `(darray - vmin) / (vmax - vmin)` requires vmin < vmax to work correctly
- When vmin > vmax, the function produces mathematically incorrect results (negative scaling factor)
- When vmin == vmax, the function causes division by zero
- The inconsistency in validation (validates in 2 cases but not the 3rd) appears to be an oversight
- The code comment at line 759 states intent to "check that an interval between them exists"
- The variable names themselves (vmin/vmax) establish the expectation that min < max

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- The function is private (underscore prefix), so internal implementation details might be intentional
- No explicit documentation states vmin must be less than vmax

### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Why it MIGHT be INVALID:**
- The function is private/internal, not part of the public API
- There's no explicit documentation requiring vmin < vmax
- The function technically "works" (produces output) even with inverted values

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The existing validation in other branches shows clear intent to enforce vmin < vmax
- The mathematical operation is fundamentally incorrect with inverted bounds
- The code produces warnings (division by zero, overflow) indicating incorrect usage

### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Why it MIGHT be WONTFIX:**
- Users providing vmin > vmax could be considered user error
- The function is internal/private, not meant for direct use
- Edge case that might rarely occur in practice

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The function is used by the public imshow API, affecting end users
- Silent incorrect behavior is worse than an error
- The fix is trivial (4-5 lines of code)
- Other branches already have this validation

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Why it MIGHT be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Adding validation could be seen as a new feature
- The current code "works" without the validation

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- The validation already exists for other cases, just missing for one
- This is about correctness, not enhancement

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Doc Issue)
**Why it MIGHT be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The public documentation doesn't explicitly state vmin must be < vmax
- Could argue the docs should clarify this requirement

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is incorrect, not just poorly documented
- The existing partial validation shows this is a code bug, not a doc issue
- Mathematical operations inherently require proper bounds

## DETAILED REASONING

The critical evidence is:

1. **Existing Validation Pattern**: The code ALREADY validates vmin < vmax in lines 762-766 and 769-773 when one parameter is None. This establishes clear intent that vmin < vmax is required.

2. **Mathematical Correctness**: The formula `(darray - vmin) / (vmax - vmin)` is a standard linear rescaling that maps [vmin, vmax] to [0, 1]. This mathematically requires vmin < vmax.

3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The function validates the relationship in 2 out of 3 cases, but misses the case when both are provided. This is clearly an oversight, not intentional design.

4. **Silent Failure**: The function produces incorrect results without warning when vmin >= vmax, which violates the principle of failing fast and clearly.

5. **Code Comments**: Line 759 explicitly states the intent to "check that an interval between them exists", but this check is missing for the both-provided case.

## CONCLUSION

This is a valid BUG. The function has inconsistent validation that allows mathematically incorrect operations to proceed silently. The existing validation in other branches proves this is unintended behavior that should be fixed.
