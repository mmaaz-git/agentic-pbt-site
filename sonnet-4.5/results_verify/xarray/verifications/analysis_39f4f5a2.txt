BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluation Against Each Category:
----------------------------------

INVALID?
--------
Arguments against INVALID:
- The bug report is technically correct - the hash DOES change when global options change
- This violates Python's documented hash contract for hashable objects
- The class implements __hash__ and __eq__, indicating it's meant to be hashable
- There's no documentation saying the hash is allowed to change

Arguments for INVALID:
- None found. The bug is real and violates Python's requirements.

Verdict: NOT INVALID

WONTFIX?
--------
Arguments for WONTFIX:
- These objects might only be used as default parameter values, not in collections
- The issue might be considered obscure if never actually used in sets/dicts in practice

Arguments against WONTFIX:
- This is a fundamental violation of Python's hash contract
- Can cause silent data corruption (objects disappearing from sets/dicts)
- The class explicitly implements __hash__, suggesting hashability was intended
- The fix is simple and doesn't break functionality

Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - This is a serious correctness issue

FEATURE_REQUEST?
----------------
Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:
- One could argue that "stable hashing" is a new feature

Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Python's hash contract is not optional for objects implementing __hash__
- The current behavior is a bug, not a missing feature

Verdict: NOT A FEATURE_REQUEST

DOCUMENTATION_FIX?
------------------
Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code might be working as designed, just not documented

Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The behavior violates fundamental Python contracts
- No reasonable documentation could justify mutable hashes
- The issue is in the code implementation, not the documentation
- Even if documented, this would still be incorrect behavior

Verdict: NOT A DOCUMENTATION_FIX

BUG?
----
Arguments for BUG:
- Violates Python's core requirement that hash values must not change during object lifetime
- Causes actual data corruption (objects lost from sets/dicts)
- The class implements __hash__ indicating it should be properly hashable
- The fix is straightforward - hash should be based on immutable attributes
- No documentation justifies or warns about this behavior
- Can cause silent, hard-to-debug failures in user code

Arguments against BUG:
- None substantial. This is clearly incorrect behavior.

Verdict: THIS IS A BUG

FINAL DETERMINATION
===================
This is a valid BUG report. The CombineKwargDefault class violates Python's fundamental requirement that object hashes must remain constant during their lifetime. The implementation makes objects unsuitable for use in sets or as dictionary keys, causing silent data corruption. The proposed fix (hashing the immutable tuple of name, old, and new values) is correct and should be implemented.
