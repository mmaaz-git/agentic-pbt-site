## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug)
**Strong Evidence For:**
- The function violates a fundamental mathematical invariant: returned chunks must sum to input size
- This invariant is enforced by downstream code (align_nd_chunks raises ValueError if sums don't match)
- The bug occurs consistently for all cases where size < chunk_size
- Real-world impact: Could cause data corruption when writing to Zarr with align_chunks=True
- The fix is straightforward and logical: cap the first chunk at the remaining size

**Evidence Against:**
- Function is internal (not public API), but still used in production code
- No explicit documentation stating this invariant (but usage context makes it clear)

#### 2. INVALID
**Evidence For:**
- Function has no docstring explicitly stating chunks must sum to size
- Function is internal/private (not in public API)

**Evidence Against:**
- The function is called with sum(var_chunks) as the size parameter, clearly indicating expectation
- Downstream validation (align_nd_chunks) explicitly checks this invariant and raises error
- The bug causes actual failures in the system, not just theoretical issues
- Mathematical correctness: chunks dividing a size MUST sum to that size

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Evidence For:**
- Could argue size < chunk_size is an edge case
- Function is internal, not public API

**Evidence Against:**
- Not an obscure edge case - happens whenever dimension size < chunk size (common in real data)
- Causes actual data corruption potential
- Has real-world impact on users using Zarr backend with small dimensions
- Fix is simple and non-breaking

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Evidence For:**
- Could argue handling size < chunk_size is a new feature

**Evidence Against:**
- This is not a new feature but a bug fix for incorrect behavior
- The function already attempts to handle this case but does so incorrectly
- The invariant (sum of chunks = size) is fundamental, not optional

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Evidence For:**
- Function lacks documentation about its contract

**Evidence Against:**
- The code behavior is objectively wrong, not just poorly documented
- Adding documentation saying "chunks may sum to more than size" would be incorrect
- The fix requires code change, not documentation change

### Decision Rationale

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Mathematical Correctness**: When dividing a size into chunks, the chunks MUST sum to the original size. This is not negotiable or context-dependent.

2. **Contract Violation**: The function is called with sum(var_chunks) expecting chunks that sum to exactly that value. The downstream code enforces this with explicit validation.

3. **Real Impact**: This affects real users with real data (small dimensions with large chunk sizes), potentially causing data corruption.

4. **Clear Fix**: The proposed fix (capping first chunk at remaining size) is correct and non-breaking.

5. **Not an Edge Case**: Small dimensions are common in scientific data (e.g., single timestep, few vertical levels, etc.)

The lack of explicit documentation doesn't make this behavior correct - it makes it undocumented incorrect behavior.
