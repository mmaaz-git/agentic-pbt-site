# Documentation Review

## Function Documentation Status
The `collapsible_section` function is an internal utility function in xarray's HTML formatting system. It has no public documentation or docstring.

## Function Purpose (Inferred from Code)
Based on code analysis, the function creates HTML sections that can be expanded/collapsed in Jupyter notebook displays. It generates:
- A checkbox input element for expanding/collapsing
- A label with section name and item count
- Inline and detailed content areas

## Documentation Search Results
1. No API documentation exists for this function (it's not part of the public API)
2. GitHub issues mention collapsible sections in HTML representation contexts
3. The function is used internally by other formatting functions like `dim_section`, `coord_section`, etc.

## Expected Behavior (From UX Perspective)
While not explicitly documented, standard UX principles suggest:
- Enabled/interactive elements should have tooltips to guide user interaction
- Disabled/non-interactive elements should not have tooltips suggesting interaction is possible
- Tooltips should help users understand what actions they can take

## Conclusion
There is no formal documentation specifying tooltip behavior for this function. However, the current implementation violates basic UX principles by showing interaction hints on disabled elements while omitting them on enabled elements. The bug report correctly identifies this as incorrect behavior based on reasonable expectations of UI behavior.
