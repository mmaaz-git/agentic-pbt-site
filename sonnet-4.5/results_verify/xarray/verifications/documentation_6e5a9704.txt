## Documentation Findings for xarray.compat.array_api_compat.result_type

### Array API Specification
The Array API specification for `result_type()` states:
- Accepts "an arbitrary number of input arrays, scalars, and/or dtypes"
- Returns the dtype resulting from type promotion rules
- Supports integers, floats, complex numbers, booleans, and dtypes
- At least one argument must be an array or a dtype
- Does NOT explicitly mention how to handle string or bytes scalars

### NumPy's result_type Behavior
NumPy's `result_type()` documentation shows:
- It accepts arrays and dtypes as arguments
- When given a string like 'i4' or 'c8', numpy interprets these as dtype format strings (e.g., 'i4' = int32, 'c8' = complex128)
- Strings are NOT treated as scalar values but as dtype specifications
- This is shown in the examples: `np.result_type('i4', 'c8')` returns `dtype('complex128')`

### XArray's Implementation Context
The xarray code includes:
1. A helper function `is_weak_scalar_type()` that explicitly includes `str` and `bytes` in its definition
2. A `_future_array_api_result_type()` function that handles weak scalar types specially
3. Comments referencing GitHub issue #805 on the Array API about extending result_type to handle Python scalars

### Key Observations
- The xarray implementation has infrastructure to handle str/bytes as weak scalar types
- The current `result_type()` function bypasses this handling when `xp is np`
- NumPy's `result_type()` interprets strings as dtype format strings, not as scalar values
- The Array API specification does not explicitly define how str/bytes scalars should be handled
- The code comment references a future Array API version that would include proper scalar handling

### Documentation Ambiguity
The Array API specification is ambiguous about string/bytes scalar handling. While it says the function accepts "scalars", it doesn't explicitly define whether strings and bytes count as scalars or how they should be promoted. The xarray implementation appears to be anticipating a future Array API specification that would clarify this.
