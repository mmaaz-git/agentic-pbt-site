## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The current behavior is nonsensical - displaying "(-1)" as a count makes no sense in a UI
- The function treats negative numbers as "having items" which is counterintuitive
- While not documented, the semantic meaning of "n_items" (number of items) implies non-negative values
- The fix is trivial and makes the code more robust
- Even though it's internal, it's a public function that can be imported and used

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is undocumented, so there's no explicit contract being violated
- Current callers always pass non-negative values, so this doesn't affect normal usage
- It's an internal utility function not meant for external use

#### INVALID (Incorrect report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function has no documentation specifying what values are valid
- Without a specification, we can't say the current behavior is "wrong"
- The function works correctly for all actual use cases in the codebase

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The semantic meaning of "n_items" clearly implies counting items (non-negative)
- Displaying negative counts in HTML is objectively nonsensical
- Just because it's undocumented doesn't mean all behaviors are valid

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an edge case that never occurs in practice
- All actual callers pass `len(mapping)` which is always non-negative
- It's an internal function not meant for direct use
- The impact is minimal - just a display issue if someone misuses it

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- It makes the code more robust and defensive
- Even internal functions should handle edge cases reasonably

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as adding input validation that wasn't there before
- The function currently "works" with negative values (just not sensibly)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This isn't adding new functionality, it's fixing nonsensical behavior
- The change makes negative values behave like zero, not add new features

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The real issue is lack of documentation about valid inputs
- If documented properly, users would know not to pass negative values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is wrong regardless of documentation
- Documentation alone won't fix the nonsensical HTML output

### Analysis Summary

This is a case where an internal, undocumented function has a logic error that produces nonsensical output when given invalid input. While the function is never called with negative values in practice, it:

1. Has a clear semantic meaning (n_items = number of items) that implies non-negative values
2. Produces objectively wrong HTML output (displaying negative counts)
3. Has a trivial fix that makes it more robust
4. Is technically a public function that can be imported

The key question is whether bugs in edge cases of undocumented internal functions should be fixed. Given that:
- The fix is trivial
- The current behavior is nonsensical (not just different)
- The function can be imported and used directly
- Making code more robust is generally good practice

This leans toward being a valid BUG rather than WONTFIX.
