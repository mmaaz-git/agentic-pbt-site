## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Reproduction

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs when calling `RangeIndex.linspace` with `num=1` and `endpoint=True`.

#### Hypothesis Test
The provided hypothesis test correctly identifies the issue. When run, it immediately fails with:
```
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero
```
The error occurs on line 283 of range_index.py in the expression `(num - 1)` which evaluates to 0 when `num=1`.

#### Direct Reproduction
The simple example provided also confirms the bug:
```python
RangeIndex.linspace(0.0, 1.0, num=1, endpoint=True, dim="x")
```
This crashes with the same ZeroDivisionError.

### Root Cause

The bug is in the implementation at line 283 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/xarray_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray/indexes/range_index.py`:

```python
if endpoint:
    stop += (stop - start) / (num - 1)
```

When `num=1`, this code performs division by zero (`num - 1 = 0`).

### NumPy Behavior Comparison

I tested numpy.linspace with the same parameters to understand the expected behavior:

1. `numpy.linspace(0, 1, 1, endpoint=True)` returns `[0.]` (the start value)
2. `numpy.linspace(0, 1, 1, endpoint=False)` also returns `[0.]` (the start value)

NumPy handles the `num=1` case gracefully by returning an array containing just the start value, regardless of the endpoint parameter. This makes sense because with only one point, there's no meaningful distinction between including or excluding the endpoint.

### Conclusion

The bug is confirmed. RangeIndex.linspace should handle the `num=1` case without crashing, similar to how numpy.linspace handles it. The current implementation fails to account for this edge case, resulting in a ZeroDivisionError.
