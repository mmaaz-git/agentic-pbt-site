Documentation Analysis for RangeIndex.linspace
==============================================

After reviewing the documentation and implementation:

1. **RangeIndex.linspace Documentation** (from xarray/indexes/range_index.py lines 227-289):
   - The docstring states that it creates "a new RangeIndex from given start/stop values and number of values"
   - It explicitly states it's "similar to numpy.linspace"
   - Parameters documented:
     - num: "Number of values in the interval, i.e., dimension size (default: 50)"
     - endpoint: "If True (default), the stop value is included in the interval"
   - The documentation does NOT specify what should happen when num=1

2. **NumPy linspace Behavior**:
   - numpy.linspace handles num=1 gracefully
   - With num=1, endpoint=True: returns an array with just the start value [start]
   - With num=1, endpoint=False: also returns an array with just the start value [start]
   - This is a well-defined behavior - when you only have one point, it should be at the start

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The RangeIndex.linspace code at line 283 contains: `stop += (stop - start) / (num - 1)`
   - This is executed when endpoint=True
   - When num=1, this results in division by zero (1 - 1 = 0)
   - The formula appears to be adjusting the stop value to ensure the correct spacing when endpoint is included

4. **Design Intent**:
   - The documentation explicitly states the function is "similar to numpy.linspace"
   - This creates a reasonable expectation that it should handle the same edge cases as numpy
   - The num parameter accepts any integer, with no documented minimum value restriction
   - Creating a single-point coordinate is a valid and reasonable use case in scientific computing

5. **No Warning About num=1**:
   - The documentation does not warn users that num=1 is invalid or unsupported
   - There's no documented minimum value for num
   - The default is 50, but this doesn't imply smaller values are invalid
