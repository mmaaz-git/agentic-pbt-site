## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The `_load_static_files()` function has minimal documentation:
- Docstring: "Lazily load the resource files into memory the first time they are needed"
- The underscore prefix indicates it's an internal/private function
- No explicit documentation about return type mutability or caching behavior

### Python's lru_cache Documentation
According to Python's official documentation for functools.lru_cache:
1. The cache "keeps references to the arguments and return values until they age out of the cache"
2. The documentation warns that caching "doesn't make sense" for functions that "need to create distinct mutable objects on each call"
3. This implies that lru_cache caches the actual object reference, not a copy

### Expected Behavior Analysis
Given the function's purpose and name:
1. The function loads static files (HTML and CSS content) that should not change during runtime
2. The word "static" in the function name strongly suggests immutability
3. The caching decorator is meant to improve performance by avoiding redundant file I/O
4. The only usage of this function unpacks the returned value for read-only access: `icons_svg, css_style = _load_static_files()`

### Documentation Verdict
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that the return value should be immutable, the function's purpose, naming convention, and usage pattern all strongly imply that:
1. The cached data should remain unchanged throughout the program's execution
2. Callers should not be able to modify the cached static content
3. The current behavior (returning a mutable cached list) violates these implicit expectations

The bug is not a documentation issue but a genuine implementation flaw where the code fails to meet reasonable expectations for cached static content.
