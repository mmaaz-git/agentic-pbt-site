## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug occurs when calling `result_type` with string or bytes scalars.

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test failed with multiple string inputs, confirming the bug exists for various string values. Examples of failing inputs include:
   - `text='test'`
   - `text='0'`
   - `text='01'`
   - And various other string patterns

2. **Simple Reproduction Test**:
   - `is_weak_scalar_type('test')` returns `True`, confirming strings are recognized as weak scalar types
   - `result_type('test', xp=np)` raises `TypeError: data type 'test' not understood`
   - `result_type(b'test', xp=np)` raises the same `TypeError` for bytes
   - `_future_array_api_result_type('test', xp=np)` works correctly and returns `<U4` dtype
   - `np.result_type('test')` directly raises `TypeError`, confirming numpy doesn't support string scalars

### Root Cause Confirmed

The bug report's analysis is correct. The issue is in the `result_type` function at line 40-46 of array_api_compat.py:

```python
def result_type(*arrays_and_dtypes, xp) -> np.dtype:
    if xp is np or any(
        isinstance(getattr(t, "dtype", t), np.dtype) for t in arrays_and_dtypes
    ):
        return xp.result_type(*arrays_and_dtypes)  # Calls numpy's result_type
    else:
        return _future_array_api_result_type(*arrays_and_dtypes, xp=xp)
```

When `xp is np` (which is true when numpy is passed), it directly calls numpy's `result_type`, which doesn't support string/bytes scalars. The function should instead route string/bytes scalars to `_future_array_api_result_type`, which has explicit support for these types.

The bug is real and consistently reproducible. The code explicitly declares support for string and bytes as weak scalar types, and has internal handling for them in `_future_array_api_result_type`, but the routing logic prevents this handling from being used.
