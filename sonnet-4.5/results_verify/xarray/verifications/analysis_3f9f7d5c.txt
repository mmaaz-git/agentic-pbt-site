# Bug Triage Analysis

## Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible - HTML special characters are not escaped
- The module consistently escapes all other HTML content using the `escape()` function
- The inconsistency is clear when compared to the rest of the codebase
- HTML generation functions have a well-established implicit contract to escape content

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The function has no documentation specifying it should escape inputs
- It's an internal function not part of the public API
- Current usage only involves hardcoded strings that don't need escaping

**Conclusion:** NOT INVALID - The bug represents a real inconsistency that violates established patterns

## Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- The function is internal and not exposed in the public API
- Current callers only pass safe, hardcoded strings like "Dimensions"
- The risk is minimal since users don't directly call this function
- The issue may never manifest in practice given current usage

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The fix is trivial (one line change to add `escape()`)
- Inconsistent escaping is a code smell that could lead to future issues
- If the function is ever used with dynamic content, it becomes a security issue
- The module already imports and uses `escape()` extensively

**Conclusion:** Possible WONTFIX if considered too minor, but the trivial fix argues against this

## Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The function lacks any documentation about its behavior
- Documentation could specify that inputs must be pre-escaped

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- Adding documentation that says "caller must escape" would be inconsistent with module patterns
- The fix should be in the code, not documentation workarounds

**Conclusion:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - This is a code issue, not a documentation issue

## Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- HTML escaping could be seen as a "new feature" for this function

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
- The module already demonstrates that escaping is expected behavior
- It's a bug fix to align with established patterns, not a feature

**Conclusion:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing a bug, not adding a feature

## Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- Clear inconsistency with the module's established escaping patterns
- Function generates potentially malformed/unsafe HTML with certain inputs
- The module imports `escape` and uses it everywhere else except this one location
- Property-based testing reveals the contract violation
- While currently only called with safe strings, the function API accepts any string
- Standard security practice requires HTML generation functions to escape content
- The fix is trivial and aligns the function with the rest of the module

**Arguments against BUG:**
- Internal function not meant for public use
- Current usage patterns don't expose the issue
- No explicit documentation stating escaping is required

**Conclusion:** STRONG case for BUG - Inconsistent behavior that violates implicit contracts

## Final Assessment
This should be classified as **BUG** because:
1. The function demonstrably fails to escape HTML content when every other similar function in the module does
2. This creates a potential security vulnerability if the function is ever used with user-controlled input
3. The inconsistency violates the implicit contract that HTML generation functions should produce safe, valid HTML
4. The module already has all the infrastructure (imports `escape`) to handle this correctly
5. The fix is trivial and brings the function in line with established patterns

While the function is internal and currently only used with safe inputs, the inconsistency represents a genuine bug that should be fixed to maintain code quality and prevent future issues.
