## Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug reported against xarray's RangeCoordinateTransform.reverse function.

### Test Execution
1. **Hypothesis Test**: The hypothesis test failed exactly as described, finding the minimal failing case with start=0.0, stop=0.0, size=1, position=0.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: The provided reproduction script confirms the bug:
   - When start=0.0 and stop=0.0, the step becomes 0.0 (calculated as (stop-start)/size = 0/1 = 0)
   - The reverse() function performs division by step (line 74: positions = (labels - self.start) / self.step)
   - This division by zero produces NaN instead of a valid position
   - The forward/reverse round-trip property is violated: original [0.] becomes [nan]

### Bug Effect
The bug occurs when creating a RangeCoordinateTransform with equal start and stop values. This represents a constant coordinate (all positions map to the same value). The reverse transformation fails with division by zero, returning NaN values instead of valid positions.

The RuntimeWarning "invalid value encountered in divide" is raised at line 74 of range_index.py, confirming the division by zero issue.

This is a valid logic bug that breaks the expected mathematical property that forward and reverse should be inverse operations.
