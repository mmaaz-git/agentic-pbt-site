REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

BUG CONFIRMATION
----------------
The bug report is accurate and reproducible. The PandasIndex.roll method crashes with a ZeroDivisionError when called on an empty index.

REPRODUCTION STEPS
------------------
1. Hypothesis Test Result:
   - Ran the provided property-based test with Hypothesis
   - Test FAILED with ZeroDivisionError on first example (shift=0)
   - Error occurs for ANY shift value when the index is empty
   - Traceback confirms line 914 in indexes.py: shift = shifts[self.dim] % self.index.shape[0]

2. Manual Reproduction:
   - Created empty pandas Index: Index([], dtype='object')
   - Wrapped in PandasIndex with dimension 'x'
   - Called roll({'x': 1})
   - Result: ZeroDivisionError: integer modulo by zero
   - Exact same error and line number as reported

ROOT CAUSE
----------
The issue is in line 914 of xarray/core/indexes.py:
```python
shift = shifts[self.dim] % self.index.shape[0]
```

When the index is empty, self.index.shape[0] is 0, causing division by zero in the modulo operation.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
-----------------
Based on testing similar operations in related libraries:
- pandas Series.shift() on empty Series: Returns empty Series (no error)
- numpy.roll() on empty array: Returns empty array (no error)
- pandas DataFrame.rolling() on empty DataFrame: Returns empty DataFrame (no error)

All these operations handle empty inputs gracefully by returning empty results.

IMPACT
------
This bug causes a crash instead of graceful handling of a valid edge case. Empty indexes can legitimately occur in data processing pipelines after filtering operations or when working with subsets. The crash prevents xarray from working correctly in these scenarios.
