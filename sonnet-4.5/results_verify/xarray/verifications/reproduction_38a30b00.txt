# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The xarray.compat.dask_array_compat.reshape_blockwise function fails to correctly reshape a (1, 1) dask array to (1,).

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Property-based Test
I ran the provided property-based test and confirmed it fails for the specific case of rows=1, cols=1:
- Created a test that reshapes arrays from shape (rows, cols) to (rows*cols,)
- Test passes for most inputs but fails when rows=1 and cols=1
- Error: AssertionError: Shape should match: (1, 1) vs (1,)

### 2. Simple Test Case
I ran the simple reproduction case from the bug report:
```python
arr = da.arange(1).reshape(1, 1)
result = reshape_blockwise(arr, (1,))
```
- Expected result shape: (1,)
- Actual result shape: (1, 1)
- The function returned the wrong shape, confirming the bug

## Source Code Analysis
Reviewed the xarray implementation at /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/xarray_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray/compat/dask_array_compat.py:

The function is a thin wrapper that:
1. Checks if dask version >= 2024.08.2 is available
2. If yes, delegates to dask.array.reshape_blockwise
3. If no, falls back to x.reshape(shape)

The bug occurs because when dask >= 2024.08.2 is available, the function delegates directly to dask's reshape_blockwise, which appears to have this edge case bug for (1,1) -> (1,) reshapes.

## Effect
This is a legitimate functionality bug where:
- A valid reshape operation (1,1) -> (1,) fails to produce the correct output shape
- The function returns (1,1) instead of (1,)
- This could affect downstream operations expecting the correct shape
- The bug report mentions this affects the least_squares function when residuals have shape (1,1)
