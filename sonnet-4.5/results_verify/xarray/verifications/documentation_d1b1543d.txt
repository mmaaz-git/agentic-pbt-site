Documentation Analysis
======================

1. xarray.cov Documentation:
   - The xarray.cov function documentation states: "If ddof=1, covariance is normalized by N-1, giving an unbiased estimate, else normalization is by N."
   - The documentation does NOT specify what happens when ddof >= N (the number of data points)
   - The documentation references pandas.Series.cov as the "corresponding pandas function"
   - No warnings or edge cases are mentioned regarding ddof values

2. NumPy.cov Documentation:
   - NumPy's documentation similarly does not explicitly state what happens when ddof >= N
   - However, NumPy's actual behavior is consistent: it returns inf with a warning when degrees of freedom <= 0

3. Statistical Context:
   - In statistics, covariance with ddof (degrees of freedom adjustment) divides by (N - ddof)
   - When N - ddof <= 0, the calculation is mathematically undefined or infinite
   - Self-covariance (variance) should never be negative, as it represents squared deviations

4. Expected Behavior:
   - Since xarray.cov references pandas.Series.cov and aims for NumPy compatibility, it should handle edge cases consistently
   - The function should not produce mathematically invalid results (negative variance)
   - A warning should be issued when degrees of freedom are insufficient

Conclusion:
The documentation does not explicitly specify the behavior for ddof >= N, but:
1. The current implementation produces mathematically incorrect results (negative covariance for self-covariance)
2. The behavior is inconsistent with NumPy, which xarray generally aims to be compatible with
3. The lack of warnings leaves users unaware of the invalid calculation
