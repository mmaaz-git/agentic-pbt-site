## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug. The issue is confirmed:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `_wrap_datatree_repr` is defined with `end: bool = False` as its default parameter value (line 437 in formatting_html.py).

2. **Documentation**: The docstring explicitly states "Default is True" (line 465).

3. **Test Results**:
   - When inspecting the function signature programmatically, it shows the actual default is `False`
   - When calling the function without the `end` parameter, it behaves identically to calling it with `end=False`
   - The behavior with default parameters does NOT match `end=True`

4. **Hypothesis Test**: The property-based test fails as expected, confirming that the documented behavior (default should be True) does not match the actual implementation (default is False).

The bug report is accurate - there is a clear discrepancy between the documented default value and the actual default value in the function signature. The function behaves with `end=False` as the default, not `end=True` as documented.
