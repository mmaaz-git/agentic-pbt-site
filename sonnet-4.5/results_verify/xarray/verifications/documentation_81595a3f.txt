# Documentation Analysis

## Function Documentation Status

### pretty_print()
- **Has docstring**: Yes
- **Docstring content**: "Given an object `x`, call `str(x)` and format the returned string so that it is numchars long, padding with trailing spaces or truncating with ellipses as necessary"
- **Public API documentation**: Not found in xarray's public API documentation

### maybe_truncate()
- **Has docstring**: No
- **Docstring content**: None
- **Public API documentation**: Not found in xarray's public API documentation

## Key Documentation Points

### pretty_print() Documentation Analysis

The docstring explicitly states that the function will:
1. Convert the input to a string using `str(x)`
2. Format the returned string so that **it is numchars long**
3. Either pad with trailing spaces OR truncate with ellipses

The phrase "it is numchars long" is unambiguous - it means the result should be exactly `numchars` characters in length. The current implementation violates this documented behavior when `numchars < 3`.

### maybe_truncate() Documentation Analysis

This function has no docstring at all. However, from its name and implementation, the implicit contract is clear:
- "maybe" indicates it will truncate conditionally (when string is too long)
- "truncate" means to shorten something
- The `maxlen` parameter name strongly implies a maximum length constraint

The function name and parameter name create a reasonable expectation that the output will never exceed `maxlen` characters. A function called `maybe_truncate` with a parameter `maxlen` that returns strings longer than `maxlen` violates the principle of least surprise.

## Module Status

Both functions are:
- Located in `xarray.core.formatting` (the `core` subpackage suggests internal implementation)
- Not documented in the public API reference
- Exported by the module (appear in `dir(formatting)`)
- Used internally by xarray for formatting output

## Conclusion

1. **pretty_print()** has explicit documentation stating it returns a string that "is numchars long" - the bug clearly violates this documented behavior.

2. **maybe_truncate()** lacks documentation, but its name and parameter strongly imply it should respect the `maxlen` constraint. The current behavior violates reasonable expectations based on the function's interface.

3. These appear to be internal utility functions (in the `core` subpackage) but are still accessible and have clear contracts (explicit for pretty_print, implicit for maybe_truncate) that are being violated.
