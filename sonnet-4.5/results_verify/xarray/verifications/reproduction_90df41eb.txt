BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

TEST RESULTS:

1. **Single-element array [5.0]**:
   - RESULT: ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
   - CONFIRMS BUG REPORT: Yes, crashes exactly as reported

2. **Empty array []**:
   - RESULT: ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
   - CONFIRMS BUG REPORT: Yes, also crashes with same error

3. **Two-element array [1.0, 5.0]**:
   - RESULT: True (works correctly)
   - This shows the function works for arrays with 2+ elements

4. **Normal uniform array [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]**:
   - RESULT: True (works correctly)
   - Expected behavior for uniformly spaced arrays

5. **Non-uniform array [-4, 0, 100]**:
   - RESULT: False (works correctly)
   - Expected behavior matching the docstring example

6. **Hypothesis property test**:
   - Tested multiple random single-element arrays
   - ALL failed with the same ValueError
   - Confirms the bug is consistent for any single-element input

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

The bug occurs because:
1. For a single-element array [x], np.diff([x]) returns an empty array []
2. The code then calls diffs.min() and diffs.max() on this empty array
3. NumPy's min() and max() functions cannot operate on empty arrays without an identity value
4. This causes the ValueError: "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity"

The same issue occurs for empty input arrays [], where np.diff([]) also returns [].

MATHEMATICAL CONSIDERATION:

The bug report's claim that single-element arrays should be "trivially uniformly spaced" is mathematically reasonable:
- A single element has no spacing to measure, so it could be considered uniformly spaced by default
- This is similar to how an empty set vacuously satisfies many properties
- Two-element arrays are always uniformly spaced (only one gap), which the function handles correctly

REPRODUCTION VERDICT:
The bug is 100% reproducible. The function crashes on both single-element and empty arrays exactly as described in the bug report. The technical details in the bug report are accurate.
