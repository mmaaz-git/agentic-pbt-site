## Bug Reproduction Report

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test failed as expected. Running `test_cache_returns_independent_copies()` with any string value (including empty string) causes an AssertionError. The test demonstrates that after appending to the first returned list, the second call returns a list with 3 elements instead of the expected 2.

### Manual Reproduction Results
Running the manual reproduction code confirmed the issue:
- First call: 2 items (expected)
- Second call: 3 items (unexpected - should be 2)
- Same object: True (confirms both calls return the same object reference)
- Last item: INJECTED (confirms the mutation persisted across calls)

### Effect of the Bug
The bug allows any code that calls `_load_static_files()` to modify the cached list, which then affects all subsequent calls. This violates the principle of immutability for cached values. The function is intended to load static CSS and HTML files for xarray's HTML representation system, and these should remain constant throughout the program's execution.

The practical impact is that if any code accidentally or intentionally modifies the returned list (by appending, removing, or modifying elements), it would corrupt the HTML/CSS rendering for all subsequent xarray objects displayed in notebooks or other HTML contexts.
