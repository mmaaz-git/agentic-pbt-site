## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function has no documentation specifying it should escape HTML. Without an explicit contract stating that the function will handle HTML escaping, the caller could be expected to provide pre-escaped input. The function might be designed as an internal utility that assumes trusted input only.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
Every other similar function in the same module that generates HTML uses `escape()` for string parameters, establishing a clear pattern. The function generates HTML output and embeds the parameter directly without any documentation warning about HTML injection risks. The principle of least surprise suggests functions generating HTML should escape by default.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The function is only used internally with hardcoded string constants that don't contain HTML special characters. There's no current vulnerability, and the function is not part of the public API. The maintainers might consider this an internal implementation detail that doesn't need fixing since it's never exposed to user input.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency with other functions in the same module is a code quality issue regardless of current usage. Future developers might reasonably assume the function handles escaping like all other similar functions do. The fix is trivial (one line addition) and improves defense in depth.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The function lacks any docstring explaining its parameters or behavior. If the intended behavior is to require pre-escaped input, this should be documented. Adding documentation stating "Warning: name parameter must be pre-escaped for HTML" would clarify the contract.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The issue isn't that the documentation is wrong or misleading - there simply is no documentation. The actual behavior (not escaping) combined with the pattern established by every other function in the module (escaping) suggests the code is wrong, not that documentation is missing.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding HTML escaping could be viewed as a new feature - making the function safer and more consistent with others in the module. The function currently works as implemented (generates valid HTML with trusted input), and adding escaping would be an enhancement for safety.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't adding new functionality but fixing an inconsistency. Every other HTML-generating function in the module already escapes parameters. This is more about bringing the function in line with established patterns than adding a new capability.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function is inconsistent with every other similar function in the module - all others use `escape()` for string parameters. This violates the principle of least surprise and defense in depth. A developer familiar with the module would reasonably expect this function to escape HTML like all the others do. The lack of escaping creates a potential security vulnerability if the function is ever used with untrusted input.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There's no actual vulnerability in the current codebase since the function is only called with hardcoded strings. The function produces correct HTML output for its current usage. Without documentation specifying the expected behavior, it's unclear if this is a bug or working as designed for internal use with trusted input only.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report identifies a real inconsistency in the codebase where `collapsible_section` is the only HTML-generating function in the module that doesn't escape string parameters. The reproduction confirms the technical accuracy of the report. However, several factors suggest this should not be classified as a BUG:

First, the function is clearly an internal utility, not part of the public API. It has no documentation and is only used within the module itself with hardcoded, trusted string constants. There is no current security vulnerability because user input never reaches this function. The report acknowledges this with its "Low" severity rating and note about "no actual vulnerability exists in the current codebase."

Second, while the inconsistency with other functions is real, inconsistency alone doesn't constitute a bug when the function works correctly for its intended use case. Many internal functions in libraries have different safety characteristics than public-facing ones. The function produces valid, working HTML for all its current use cases.

Third, the "defense in depth" argument, while valid from a security best practices perspective, is more about preventing potential future issues than fixing a current bug. This makes it more of an enhancement or hardening request than a bug fix. The proposed change would add safety margin but doesn't fix any broken functionality.

Given that the function works correctly for its current purpose, has no documentation promising HTML escaping, and poses no actual security risk in its current usage, this appears to be either a WONTFIX (internal function working as designed) or at most a FEATURE_REQUEST (add escaping for consistency and future-proofing). Since the report emphasizes consistency and future risk over current problems, and the fix would enhance safety without fixing broken functionality, FEATURE_REQUEST seems most appropriate.
