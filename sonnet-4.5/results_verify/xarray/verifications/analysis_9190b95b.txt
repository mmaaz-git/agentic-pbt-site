# Bug Triage Analysis

## BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function produces mathematically incorrect results for non-monotonic input
- The breaks don't contain all original coordinate values, violating a basic invariant
- No warning is given when non-monotonic data produces incorrect results with default parameters
- The bug can cause silent data corruption in visualizations
- The function accepts non-monotonic input without error when `check_monotonic=False`

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The underscore prefix indicates this is an internal function
- When used properly through plotting functions, `check_monotonic=True` is passed
- The algorithm inherently assumes monotonic data based on its mathematical design

## INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function is internal (underscore prefix) and not part of the public API
- When used correctly through `pcolormesh`, it enforces monotonic checking
- The algorithm mathematically requires monotonic input to work correctly
- Users shouldn't be calling internal functions directly

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function is importable and can be used directly
- The default parameter value allows incorrect usage
- The documentation doesn't state the monotonic requirement
- Silent incorrect results are worse than errors

## WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The issue only occurs with direct usage of an internal function
- Proper usage through plotting functions already enforces monotonic checking
- Non-monotonic coordinates don't make sense for interval inference
- The fix would only benefit users misusing internal functions

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Silent data corruption is a serious issue
- The fix is trivial (change default parameter)
- Better to fail loudly than produce incorrect results

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function works correctly with monotonic data
- The issue is that documentation doesn't specify the monotonic requirement
- Adding documentation about the requirement would prevent misuse
- The `check_monotonic` parameter already exists for validation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The default behavior produces incorrect results
- Documentation alone won't prevent the silent failures
- The mathematical incorrectness is a code bug, not just a documentation issue

## FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Supporting non-monotonic data would be a new feature
- The current algorithm wasn't designed for non-monotonic input
- Could implement a different algorithm for non-monotonic cases

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug report isn't asking for new functionality
- It's pointing out incorrect behavior with current functionality
- The function already accepts non-monotonic input, it just handles it incorrectly

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** that should be fixed. While the function is internal (underscore prefix), it:

1. **Produces mathematically incorrect results** - The interval breaks don't contain all original values, which is fundamentally wrong for any interval inference algorithm

2. **Fails silently** - With the default `check_monotonic=False`, users get incorrect results without any warning

3. **Has an easy fix** - Simply changing the default to `check_monotonic=True` would prevent the silent failures

4. **Can cause data corruption** - Incorrect interval breaks lead to incorrect visualizations, which could mislead data analysis

5. **Is accessible and used** - Despite being internal, the function can be imported and used directly

The fact that proper usage through plotting functions enables checking doesn't excuse the dangerous default behavior. The principle of "fail loudly rather than silently corrupt data" applies here. The function should either:
- Default to `check_monotonic=True` (simplest fix)
- Handle non-monotonic data correctly
- Raise an error always for non-monotonic data

This is not just a documentation issue because the current behavior produces objectively incorrect mathematical results. It's not a feature request because the function already accepts the input that causes the problem. It's a legitimate bug in the default behavior.
