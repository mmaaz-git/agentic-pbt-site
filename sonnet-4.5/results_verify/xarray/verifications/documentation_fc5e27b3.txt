DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR is_valid_nc3_name

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION (from docstring):
The function's docstring states: "Test whether an object can be validly converted to a netCDF-3 dimension, variable or attribute name"

The docstring provides detailed requirements:
- First character must be alphanumeric, a multi-byte UTF-8 character, or '_'
- Subsequent characters may include printing special characters
- '/' is not allowed in names
- Trailing space characters are not permitted
- Names must be normalized according to Unicode NFC normalization

2. NETCDF-3 SPECIFICATION:
From the NetCDF-3 file format specification, names must match the regex:
"(\[a-zA-Z0-9\_\]|{MUTF8})(\[^\\x00-\\x1F/\\x7F-\\xFF\]|{MUTF8})*"

This regex pattern implies:
- Names must have at least one character (the first character group is mandatory)
- Empty strings are NOT valid NetCDF-3 names by specification

3. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION SAYS ABOUT EMPTY STRINGS:
- The function docstring does NOT explicitly state what should happen with empty strings
- The NetCDF-3 specification implicitly disallows empty strings (regex requires at least one char)
- The documentation does not specify that the function should raise an exception vs return False

4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Based on the documentation and function signature:
- The function should return a boolean (True if valid, False if invalid)
- The function is a validation function, not a converter
- Empty strings are invalid NetCDF-3 names according to the spec
- Therefore, is_valid_nc3_name("") should return False, not crash

5. INTERFACE CONTRACT:
The function accepts any object and tests validity. The docstring says it tests "whether an object can be validly converted" - this implies it should handle all inputs gracefully and return a boolean result, not crash on invalid inputs.
