## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Execution
I successfully ran the property-based test provided in the bug report. The test correctly identified a CSS syntax error:

1. The test scans the CSS content from xarray's static files
2. It uses regex to find var() calls that have missing commas before rgba() fallback values
3. The test FAILED with the expected error, finding line 8 with invalid syntax

Output from test:
```
Test failed: Found CSS var() calls with missing comma before fallback value:
  Line 8: var(--pst-color-text-base rgba(0, 0, 0, 1))
```

### Direct File Verification
I examined the actual CSS file at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/xarray_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray/static/css/style.css` and confirmed:

Line 8 contains: `var(--pst-color-text-base rgba(0, 0, 0, 1))`

This is missing the comma between the custom property name and the fallback value.

### Pattern Analysis
When checking other occurrences of the same pattern in the file, I found:
- Line 8: `var(--pst-color-text-base rgba(0, 0, 0, 1))` - MISSING COMMA
- Line 12: `var(--pst-color-text-base, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54))` - Has comma (correct)
- Line 16: `var(--pst-color-text-base, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.38))` - Has comma (correct)
- Line 46: `var(--pst-color-text-base, rgba(255, 255, 255, 1))` - Has comma (correct)
- Line 50: `var(--pst-color-text-base, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.54))` - Has comma (correct)
- Line 54: `var(--pst-color-text-base, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.38))` - Has comma (correct)

This clearly shows that line 8 is the only instance missing the comma, and all other uses of the same variable follow the correct syntax. This is strong evidence that line 8 contains a typo.

### Impact
The missing comma means:
1. The fallback value `rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)` will not be recognized as a fallback
2. The entire var() expression may be treated as invalid by CSS parsers
3. This could cause styling issues when `--pst-color-text-base` is not defined

The bug is real and reproducible.
