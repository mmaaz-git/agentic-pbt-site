## Documentation Analysis Report

### Function Purpose
According to the docstring in the source code, `get_exception_info` is designed to:
"Format exception information for display on the debug page using the structure described in the template API documentation."

### Documented Behavior
The function's purpose is to extract and format exception information from Jinja2 template errors for Django's debug page. It returns a dictionary containing:
- name: exception filename
- message: exception message
- source_lines: lines of source code around the error
- line: line number where error occurred
- before/during/after: context lines (before/after are empty for Jinja2)
- total: total number of lines
- top/bottom: range of lines being displayed

### Edge Case Handling in Documentation
1. **No explicit documentation about invalid line numbers**: The docstring and comments do not mention how the function should behave when lineno exceeds the source length.

2. **Partial defensive programming**: The function does handle the case where `source is None` by attempting to read from the file, and if that fails, it sets defaults (empty strings and zeros).

3. **No bounds checking documentation**: There is no documented requirement or expectation for bounds checking on the line number access.

### Expected Behavior Based on Context
The function is used in two places:
1. In `get_template()` method when catching `jinja2.TemplateSyntaxError`
2. In `Template.render()` method when catching `jinja2.TemplateSyntaxError`

Both usages expect the function to return a valid dictionary structure for the `template_debug` attribute, which is used by Django's debug page to display template errors.

### Documentation Gaps
The documentation does not specify:
- What should happen when lineno is invalid (too large, zero, negative)
- Whether the function should gracefully handle malformed exception objects
- Whether it's the caller's responsibility to ensure valid line numbers

### Conclusion
The documentation does not explicitly state that the function must handle invalid line numbers gracefully. However, given that this is a utility function for error display (not error generation), and that it already has defensive programming for missing source, it would be reasonable to expect it to handle invalid line numbers without crashing. The function's purpose is to aid debugging, and crashing during debug information generation defeats that purpose.
