## Bug Classification Analysis

### Option 1: BUG
**Arguments for:**
- The function clearly violates its documented contract
- The docstring says "truncate at maxchar" but returns strings longer than maxchar
- The bug is reproducible and deterministic
- The contract violation is unambiguous

**Arguments against:**
- This is an internal function (prefixed with _)
- The bug only occurs in edge cases (maxchar < 3) that would never occur in practice
- Default usage is maxchar=30, making this issue purely theoretical

### Option 2: WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- This is an internal function not meant for public use
- The bug occurs only for maxchar < 3, which is nonsensical for title display
- Having a title of 1-2 characters makes no practical sense
- The function works correctly for all reasonable inputs (maxchar >= 3)
- Fixing this would add complexity for no practical benefit
- The default value is 30, and users would never set it below 3

**Arguments against:**
- The function still violates its documented contract
- Property-based testing revealed a legitimate contract violation
- Even internal functions should honor their contracts

### Option 3: INVALID
**Arguments for:**
- The function is internal and not part of the public API
- Testing with maxchar < 3 could be considered invalid input

**Arguments against:**
- The docstring doesn't specify any minimum value for maxchar
- The function accepts maxchar=1 without raising an error
- The contract violation is real and demonstrable

### Option 4: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- Could update the docstring to specify minimum maxchar value
- Could clarify that maxchar must be >= 3 for proper truncation

**Arguments against:**
- The docstring is technically correct about intent
- The issue is in the implementation, not the documentation

### Option 5: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Supporting maxchar < 3 could be seen as a new feature

**Arguments against:**
- The function already claims to truncate at maxchar
- This is a bug fix, not a new feature

### Summary Assessment
This is a classic case of an edge case bug in an internal function that would never manifest in real-world usage. The function violates its contract for inputs that don't make practical sense (who needs a 1-2 character title with ellipsis?). While technically a bug, it falls into the WONTFIX category because:

1. It's an internal function (_nicetitle)
2. The bug only occurs for nonsensical input values (maxchar < 3)
3. The default and typical usage (maxchar=30) works perfectly
4. No reasonable use case would ever need maxchar < 3 for plot titles
5. The effort to fix this exceeds any practical benefit
