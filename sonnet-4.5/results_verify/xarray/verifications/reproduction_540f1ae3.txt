## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Reproduction
I successfully reproduced the reported bug. When calling:
```python
RangeIndex.linspace(0.0, 1.0, num=1, endpoint=True, dim='x')
```

The code crashes with:
```
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero
  File "xarray/indexes/range_index.py", line 283, in linspace
    stop += (stop - start) / (num - 1)
```

### Root Cause
The error occurs on line 283 of range_index.py:
```python
if endpoint:
    stop += (stop - start) / (num - 1)
```

When `num=1`, the expression `(num - 1)` evaluates to 0, causing division by zero.

### Conditions for Bug
The bug occurs when ALL of these conditions are met:
1. `num=1`
2. `endpoint=True`

The bug does NOT occur when:
- `num=1` and `endpoint=False` (works correctly)
- `num > 1` and `endpoint=True` (works correctly)

### Comparison with NumPy
NumPy's linspace handles this case gracefully:
- `np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, num=1, endpoint=True)` returns `[0.]`
- `np.linspace(5.0, 10.0, num=1, endpoint=True)` returns `[5.]`

NumPy always returns the start value when `num=1`, regardless of the endpoint setting.

### Mathematical Logic
The formula `stop += (stop - start) / (num - 1)` is used to adjust the stop value to ensure proper spacing when the endpoint is included. However, when there's only one point (`num=1`), there's no spacing to calculate - the single point should just be the start value. The division by `(num - 1)` is mathematically undefined for this edge case.
