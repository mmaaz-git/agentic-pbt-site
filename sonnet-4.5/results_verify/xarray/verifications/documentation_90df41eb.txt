DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR is_uniform_spaced

SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION:
The function is defined in xarray/core/utils.py with the following docstring:

```python
def is_uniform_spaced(arr, **kwargs) -> bool:
    """Return True if values of an array are uniformly spaced and sorted.

    >>> is_uniform_spaced(range(5))
    True
    >>> is_uniform_spaced([-4, 0, 100])
    False

    kwargs are additional arguments to ``np.isclose``
    """
```

KEY FINDINGS:

1. **No public API documentation**: The function is_uniform_spaced is NOT documented in xarray's public API reference. My search through xarray's official documentation found no mention of this function as a public API method.

2. **Internal utility function**: This appears to be an internal utility function in xarray.core.utils, used internally by xarray's plotting system to determine if coordinates are uniformly spaced for selecting appropriate plot types.

3. **Minimal docstring**: The function has only a brief docstring with two examples:
   - Example 1: range(5) returns True (uniformly spaced)
   - Example 2: [-4, 0, 100] returns False (not uniformly spaced)
   - No mention of edge cases or requirements about minimum array size

4. **No input restrictions documented**: The docstring does NOT specify:
   - Minimum number of elements required
   - How empty arrays should be handled
   - How single-element arrays should be handled
   - Whether the input must have at least 2 elements

5. **Implementation details not in docs**: The docstring doesn't describe the implementation approach (using np.diff to compute differences and comparing min/max).

6. **Mathematical interpretation unclear**: The documentation doesn't clarify what "uniformly spaced" means for edge cases like empty or single-element arrays.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is extremely minimal and does not specify behavior for edge cases. There are no documented requirements that the input array must have at least 2 elements. The function accepts any array-like input according to its signature, suggesting it should handle all valid array inputs gracefully.
