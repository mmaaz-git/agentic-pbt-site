DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Review for expand_dims():

1. FUNCTION DOCSTRING (from _array_api.py):
   - States: "Expands the shape of an array by inserting a new dimension of size one at the position specified by dims."
   - Parameters:
     * dim: "Dimension name. New dimension will be stored in the axis position." (optional, with default)
     * axis: "(Not recommended) Axis position (zero-based). Default is 0."
   - Examples show both with and without explicit dim parameter
   - NO WARNING about potential duplicate dimensions
   - NO SPECIFICATION about what happens when default dim name collides with existing dims

2. ONLINE DOCUMENTATION (xarray.NamedArray.expand_dims):
   - Very minimal documentation found
   - States new dimensions are added "at the beginning of the array"
   - Does not specify the default naming behavior when dim is not provided
   - No warnings about duplicate dimension names

3. XARRAY CODEBASE CONSTRAINTS:
   - The codebase itself contains explicit warnings against duplicate dimensions
   - In namedarray/core.py lines 512-515, there is a UserWarning that states:
     "We do not yet support duplicate dimension names, but we do allow initial construction of the object. We recommend you rename the dims immediately to become distinct, as most xarray functionality is likely to fail silently if you do not."
   - This warning is triggered when duplicate dimensions are detected

4. IMPLICIT EXPECTATIONS:
   - The function name "expand_dims" clearly implies adding NEW dimensions
   - Creating duplicate dimension names violates the fundamental concept of dimension uniqueness
   - The codebase's own warning system recognizes duplicate dimensions as problematic

5. DOCUMENTATION GAPS:
   - The docstring does not mention:
     * The default naming scheme (dim_N where N = len(dims))
     * The possibility of name collisions
     * That duplicate dimensions are unsupported by xarray
   - No warning that the default behavior could create invalid states

CONCLUSION:
While the documentation does not explicitly state that expand_dims() should avoid creating duplicate dimensions, the following points are clear:
1. The xarray codebase explicitly does not support duplicate dimensions
2. The function creates an invalid state that triggers warnings
3. The documentation fails to warn users about this potential issue
4. The behavior violates reasonable expectations of what "expand" means (adding something new, not duplicating existing)
