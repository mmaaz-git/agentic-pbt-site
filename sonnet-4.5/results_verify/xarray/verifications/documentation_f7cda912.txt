## Documentation Analysis for build_grid_chunks

### Function Status
- **Location**: xarray/backends/chunks.py, lines 136-150
- **Visibility**: Internal function (not part of public API)
- **Documentation**: NO DOCSTRING PROVIDED

### Purpose and Contract (Inferred from Usage)

1. **Primary Usage**:
   - Called by `grid_rechunk` function at line 163-166
   - Called with `sum(var_chunks)` as the size parameter
   - This clearly establishes that the function must return chunks that sum to exactly `size`

2. **Expected Behavior (from test cases)**:
   - Existing tests only cover cases where size >= chunk_size
   - All test cases verify exact chunk outputs, implying deterministic behavior
   - No test cases for size < chunk_size scenario

3. **Implicit Contract (from usage context)**:
   ```python
   build_grid_chunks(
       sum(var_chunks),  # Total size that chunks must sum to
       region=interval,
       chunk_size=chunk_size,
   )
   ```
   The function is passed the sum of variable chunks, which means the returned chunks MUST sum to this value for correctness.

4. **align_nd_chunks Validation**:
   - Line 20 validates: `if sum(backend_chunks) != sum(var_chunks)`
   - This enforces that backend chunks (from build_grid_chunks) must sum correctly
   - Raises ValueError if sums don't match: "The number of elements in the backend does not match the number of elements in the variable"

### Documentation Gaps

1. **No explicit documentation** stating the invariant that chunks must sum to size
2. **No handling specified** for edge cases where size < chunk_size
3. **No error handling** for invalid inputs (negative size, zero chunk_size, etc.)

### Conclusion

The function lacks explicit documentation, but its usage context and the align_nd_chunks validation make it clear that:
- The returned chunks MUST sum to exactly the input `size` parameter
- This is not just a preference but a hard requirement enforced by downstream code
- The current implementation violates this contract when size < chunk_size
