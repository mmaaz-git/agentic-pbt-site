## Reproduction of Bug Report

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Test Case Execution

1. **Direct reproduction of the failing case**:
   - Executed: `RangeIndex.arange(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, dim='x')`
   - Result: `index.size = -1` (confirmed negative size)

2. **Hypothesis test**:
   - The property-based test correctly identified the issue
   - Failing input: `start=1.0, stop=0.0, step=1.0`
   - The test assertion `index.size >= 0` fails with size=-1

3. **Comparison with NumPy**:
   - `numpy.arange(1.0, 0.0, 1.0)` returns an empty array with size 0
   - This confirms the expected behavior should be size=0, not size=-1

### Impact of the Bug

The negative size causes actual problems in xarray:

1. **Dataset creation appears to work** but creates an invalid dataset with dimension size -1:
   ```
   <xarray.Dataset> Size: -8B
   Dimensions:  (x: -1)
   ```

2. **Operations on the dataset fail**:
   - Attempting to add a data variable raises: "negative dimensions are not allowed"
   - This confirms that negative sizes violate internal invariants

3. **The coordinate values themselves are correctly empty**:
   - When converting to numpy array, we get an empty array as expected
   - But the size metadata is incorrect (-1 instead of 0)

### Root Cause

The bug is in line 219 of range_index.py:
```python
size = math.ceil((stop - start) / step)
```

When `start=1.0, stop=0.0, step=1.0`:
- `(0.0 - 1.0) / 1.0 = -1.0`
- `math.ceil(-1.0) = -1`

This formula doesn't handle the case where the step direction doesn't allow reaching the stop value from start.

The bug report is accurate and the reproduction confirms all claims made.
