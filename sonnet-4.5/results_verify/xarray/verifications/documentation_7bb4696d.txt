## Documentation Analysis

### CombinedLock Class Documentation

The CombinedLock class has a clear docstring (lines 211-214 in locks.py):
> "A combination of multiple locks. Like a locked door, a CombinedLock is locked if any of its constituent locks are locked."

This establishes the expected behavior: the CombinedLock should report as locked if ANY of its constituent locks are locked, and unlocked only when ALL constituent locks are unlocked.

### Method Expectations

1. **locked() method**: Should return a boolean indicating whether any constituent lock is currently locked
   - Return True if any lock is locked
   - Return False if all locks are unlocked

### Comparison with Other Lock Implementations

I examined other lock implementations in the same file:
- **SerializableLock.locked()** (line 69-70): Correctly calls `self.lock.locked()`
- **DummyLock.locked()** (line 257-258): Correctly returns False
- **threading.Lock.locked()**: Python documentation states it "Returns True if the lock is acquired"

### Documentation Verdict

The documentation is clear and unambiguous about the expected behavior. The CombinedLock.locked() method should return:
- False when all constituent locks are unlocked
- True when any constituent lock is locked

The current implementation violates this contract by returning True whenever there are any locks present, regardless of their locked state. This is a clear deviation from the documented behavior.
