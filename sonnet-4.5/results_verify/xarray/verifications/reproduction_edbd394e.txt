## Bug Reproduction Results

### Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED
The bug report's technical details are accurate - the code does crash with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` when passed a list.

### Exact Behavior

1. **With list input**: `isdtype_fallback(np.int32, ["signed integer", "bool"])`
   - Raises: `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`
   - The error occurs at line 61 when trying to compute `set(kinds)`

2. **With tuple input**: `isdtype_fallback(np.int32, ("signed integer", "bool"))`
   - Works correctly, returns `True`

### Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs because:
1. Line 57 checks `isinstance(kind, tuple)` but not `isinstance(kind, list)`
2. When `kind` is a list `["signed integer", "bool"]`, the code executes: `kinds = (kind,)`
3. This creates `kinds = (["signed integer", "bool"],)` - a tuple containing a single list element
4. Line 61 attempts `set(kinds)` which fails because lists are unhashable in Python

### Comparison with NumPy 2.0+
Testing shows that NumPy 2.0's native `isdtype` function:
- Also rejects lists, but with a clearer error message: `"kind argument must be comprised of NumPy dtypes or strings only, but is a <class 'list'>."`
- This error explicitly identifies that a list was passed and is not acceptable

### Assessment of Bug Report Claims
1. **Technical accuracy**: The bug report correctly identifies the issue and its cause
2. **"Confusing error"**: The claim that `"unhashable type: 'list'"` is confusing has some merit - it doesn't directly indicate that lists aren't supported as input
3. **"Natural input type"**: While lists and tuples are similar, the documentation and type annotations explicitly specify tuples only
4. **NumPy 2.0 comparison**: Correct - NumPy 2.0 does provide a clearer error message that explicitly mentions the list type
