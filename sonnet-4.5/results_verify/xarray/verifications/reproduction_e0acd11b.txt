Bug Reproduction Results
========================

1. Test with Non-Contiguous Intervals (from bug report):
   Input: [Interval(0, 2), Interval(5, 7), Interval(10, 12)]
   Expected (per bug report): [0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12]
   Actual Result: [0, 5, 10, 12]
   Missing boundaries: 2 and 7 (the right boundaries of non-last intervals)

   CONFIRMED: The function does not return all boundaries for non-contiguous intervals.

2. Test with Contiguous Intervals:
   Input: [Interval(0, 2), Interval(2, 5), Interval(5, 7)]
   Result: [0, 2, 5, 7]

   This works correctly because intervals are contiguous (each interval's right equals the next's left).

3. Property-Based Test:
   Generated non-contiguous intervals with gaps between them.
   Result consistently misses intermediate right boundaries when intervals are not contiguous.

   Example:
   - Input had boundaries: [0, 2.00001, 2.484..., 12.484..., 17.156..., 23.765..., 25.665..., 33.108...]
   - Output only had: [0, 2.484..., 17.156..., 25.665..., 33.108...]
   - Missing: 2.00001, 12.484..., 23.765... (all intermediate right boundaries)

4. Technical Analysis:
   The bug occurs because the implementation:
   ```python
   array_boundaries = np.array([x.left for x in array])  # Gets all left boundaries
   array_boundaries = np.concatenate((array_boundaries, np.array([array[-1].right])))  # Adds only last right
   ```

   This logic only works correctly when intervals are contiguous, where:
   - interval[i].right == interval[i+1].left for all i

   When this condition holds, the right boundaries (except the last) are already included
   as left boundaries of subsequent intervals.

5. Impact Assessment:
   - For pcolormesh plotting with non-contiguous interval coordinates, this will produce incorrect visualizations
   - The plot will show continuous cells where there should be gaps
   - Data visualization will be misleading as it won't accurately represent the interval structure

The bug report's claim is VERIFIED: The function fails to return all boundaries for non-contiguous intervals.
