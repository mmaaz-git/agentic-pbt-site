## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report assumes that these sentinel classes should follow standard mathematical ordering properties like antisymmetry. However, there is no documentation stating that `AlwaysGreaterThan` and `AlwaysLessThan` are meant to follow mathematical ordering axioms. These are special sentinel objects designed to always return `True` for their respective comparison operations, which is their explicit purpose as shown by their names and implementation. The behavior is exactly what the code says it does: always return `True` for `__gt__` regardless of the operand. The classes work correctly for their intended use case as infinity sentinels in sorting operations.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The violation of antisymmetry is a real logical inconsistency that could cause problems in code that relies on standard ordering properties. The use of `@functools.total_ordering` suggests these classes were meant to implement a proper ordering relation. The fact that `a > a` returns `True` while `a == a` also returns `True` is mathematically nonsensical and could lead to unexpected behavior in algorithms that assume transitivity and antisymmetry of comparison operators.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an obscure edge case that only occurs when comparing sentinel instances with themselves or other instances of the same class. In practical usage, these are used as singletons (INF and NINF), so comparing multiple instances rarely happens. The primary use case - sorting arrays with mixed types and using these as extreme values - works perfectly fine. The mathematical purity of ordering relations for internal sentinel objects is not critical to the library's functionality. Fixing this might break existing code that depends on the current behavior.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The issue represents a fundamental logical inconsistency in comparison operators that could cause subtle bugs. Using `@functools.total_ordering` implies an intent to create a proper ordering, and the current implementation violates basic ordering principles. The fix is simple and wouldn't affect the primary use case since the sentinels would still sort correctly as extreme values.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
There is no documentation explaining that these sentinel classes intentionally violate ordering properties or how they should behave when compared with themselves. Adding documentation to clarify that these are special sentinel objects that don't follow standard ordering axioms would prevent confusion. The classes could be documented as "always returns True for gt/lt operations by design" with a note about the antisymmetry violation being intentional for simplicity.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The lack of documentation doesn't make the behavior correct. If the behavior is logically inconsistent, documenting it doesn't fix the underlying problem. The use of `@functools.total_ordering` suggests these were meant to implement proper orderings, not just arbitrary comparison functions.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report is essentially asking for these sentinel classes to implement mathematically consistent ordering relations, which they currently don't support. This could be seen as requesting a new feature: "proper ordering semantics for sentinel values." The current implementation works for its intended purpose, and adding proper ordering would be an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The report identifies a logical inconsistency in existing functionality rather than asking for new functionality. The classes already attempt to implement ordering (via `@functools.total_ordering`), they just do it incorrectly. Fixing broken behavior is a bug fix, not a feature request.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The implementation violates fundamental properties of ordering relations (antisymmetry). The use of `@functools.total_ordering` indicates an intent to create a proper total ordering, which the current implementation fails to achieve. The test case demonstrates a clear logical inconsistency where `a > a` and `a == a` are both true, which is mathematically impossible for any consistent ordering. This could cause issues in any code that assumes comparison operators follow standard mathematical properties.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The classes are named `AlwaysGreaterThan` and `AlwaysLessThan`, which suggests their purpose is to always return `True` for their respective operations, not to implement mathematically correct orderings. There's no documentation claiming these should follow ordering axioms. The primary use case (as infinity sentinels in sorting) works correctly. The "bug" only appears in the edge case of comparing sentinels with themselves, which is not a typical use case.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at the evidence, this appears to be an internal implementation detail that works correctly for its intended purpose as infinity sentinels in object-type arrays. The classes are named `AlwaysGreaterThan` and `AlwaysLessThan`, strongly suggesting their design goal is to always return `True` for their respective comparison operations, regardless of mathematical consistency. The lack of any documentation about ordering properties, combined with the fact that the primary use case (sorting) works correctly, suggests this behavior might be intentional.

The violation of antisymmetry only manifests when comparing instances of the same sentinel class with each other, which is an extremely rare edge case given that these are typically used as singletons (INF and NINF). While the mathematical inconsistency is real, it has no practical impact on the library's functionality. The proposed fix would change behavior that might be depended upon by existing code, despite being logically inconsistent.

Given that the bug report is about an undocumented internal implementation detail that works correctly for its intended use case, and the "violation" of ordering properties might be intentional given the class names, this should be categorized as INVALID. The classes do exactly what their names suggest - they always return `True` for greater than/less than comparisons, which is their documented purpose via their names. Mathematical ordering consistency was never promised or documented for these sentinel objects.
