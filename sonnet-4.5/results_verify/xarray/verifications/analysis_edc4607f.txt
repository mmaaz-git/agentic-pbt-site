## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state that num=1 is supported, and one could argue that creating a linspace with only one point when endpoint=True is ambiguous since there's no interval to divide. The mathematical formula used internally (dividing by num-1) suggests the implementation was designed for num > 1.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states the method is "similar to numpy.linspace", and numpy.linspace handles num=1 without error. The documentation specifies no restriction on num values beyond the default of 50. Users would reasonably expect this to work like numpy.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Using num=1 with endpoint=True is an edge case that may be considered unimportant. In practice, users creating a linspace typically want multiple points, not just one. The workaround (using endpoint=False or num > 1) is simple.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This causes a hard crash with an unhelpful error message rather than a graceful failure. The fix is trivial (one if statement). The behavior diverges from numpy, which the library claims to mimic.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to specify that num must be > 1 when endpoint=True, making the current behavior correct by specification. This would clarify the API contract without changing code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting a limitation that causes crashes is poor API design when numpy handles this case gracefully. The issue is clearly a code bug, not a documentation oversight. The implementation should match numpy's behavior since it claims similarity.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting num=1 with endpoint=True could be seen as adding new functionality that wasn't originally intended. The current implementation works for the common use cases and this would extend it to handle an edge case.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't requesting new functionality - it's asking for the method to not crash on valid inputs. The method already claims numpy compatibility, and numpy supports this. It's fixing broken behavior, not adding features.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The method crashes with a ZeroDivisionError on inputs that numpy.linspace handles correctly. The documentation claims similarity to numpy but diverges in behavior. The crash is due to an implementation oversight (not checking for num=1 in the mathematical formula). The fix is simple and would align behavior with expectations.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
One could argue that the implementation implicitly requires num > 1 for the endpoint=True case, even if not documented. The mathematical formula (num-1) suggests this was the intended design.

## Overall consideration

This bug report describes a legitimate issue where RangeIndex.linspace crashes with valid inputs that numpy.linspace handles gracefully. The xarray documentation explicitly states that RangeIndex.linspace is "similar to numpy.linspace", creating a reasonable expectation that it should handle the same inputs. The documentation provides no warning that num=1 would cause a crash when endpoint=True.

The technical issue is clear: the code attempts division by (num - 1) without checking if num equals 1, causing a ZeroDivisionError. This is an implementation bug, not a documentation issue or missing feature. The crash occurs on inputs that are mathematically sensible - requesting a single-point array should return an array containing the start value, which is exactly what numpy does.

While num=1 might be considered an edge case, the fact that the code crashes rather than handling it gracefully or raising a meaningful error makes this a bug worth fixing. The proposed fix is minimal and correct, simply adding a check to avoid division by zero. This would align xarray's behavior with numpy's, which is the stated goal of the implementation.
