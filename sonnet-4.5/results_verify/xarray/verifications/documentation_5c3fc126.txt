## Documentation Analysis for _load_static_files

### Function Documentation
The `_load_static_files()` function is located in xarray/core/formatting_html.py and has a simple docstring:
"Lazily load the resource files into memory the first time they are needed"

The function is marked as internal/private (indicated by the leading underscore) and is decorated with `@lru_cache(None)`.

### Purpose
The function loads static HTML and CSS resources for xarray's HTML formatting capabilities. It reads two files:
1. icons-svg-inline.html from xarray.static.html
2. style.css from xarray.static.css

These files are used for HTML representations of xarray objects (like DataArray and Dataset).

### Caching Behavior
The function uses Python's `functools.lru_cache` decorator with unlimited cache size (`None`). According to Python's documentation, lru_cache:
- Caches return values based on input arguments (in this case, none)
- Returns the same object reference for subsequent calls with the same arguments
- Keeps references to return values until they age out or the cache is cleared

### Python Documentation on Mutable Returns
Python's functools documentation states that LRU cache "doesn't make sense to cache functions that need to create distinct mutable objects on each call." While not explicitly forbidden, the documentation suggests that caching functions should be used "when you want to reuse previously computed values."

The documentation does not explicitly warn against returning mutable objects from cached functions, but it does note that the cache keeps references to return values.

### Expectations
Given that:
1. The function is private/internal (underscore prefix)
2. It's meant to "lazily load" static files once
3. The docstring suggests the files are loaded "the first time they are needed"
4. The function is only called internally by xarray code (specifically in _obj_repr at line 305)

The apparent intention is performance optimization - to avoid repeatedly reading static files from disk. The expectation appears to be that these static files are read once and reused.

### Mutability Considerations
The function currently returns a list, which is mutable. Since lru_cache returns the same object reference, any modifications to this list would affect all subsequent callers. However:
- There is no documentation explicitly stating the return value should be immutable
- There is no documentation stating callers should not modify the returned value
- The function is internal/private, suggesting it's not part of the public API
