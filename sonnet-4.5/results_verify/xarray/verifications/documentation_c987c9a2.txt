# Documentation Analysis for _infer_interval_breaks

## Function Documentation

### 1. Internal Documentation (Docstring)
The function has minimal documentation - only examples in the docstring:
```python
"""
>>> _infer_interval_breaks(np.arange(5))
array([-0.5,  0.5,  1.5,  2.5,  3.5,  4.5])
>>> _infer_interval_breaks([[0, 1], [3, 4]], axis=1)
array([[-0.5,  0.5,  1.5],
       [ 2.5,  3.5,  4.5]])
>>> _infer_interval_breaks(np.logspace(-2, 2, 5), scale="log")
array([3.16227766e-03, 3.16227766e-02, 3.16227766e-01, 3.16227766e+00,
       3.16227766e+01, 3.16227766e+02])
"""
```

Notable observations:
- ALL examples use ascending sorted coordinates (np.arange(5), [0,1], [3,4], np.logspace)
- No documentation about sorting requirements
- No explicit statement about what the function should do with unsorted or descending data

### 2. Public API Documentation
- _infer_interval_breaks is a private function (starts with underscore)
- Not documented in the public xarray API documentation
- Used internally by plotting functions like pcolormesh

### 3. Related Public Documentation

From xarray plotting documentation:
- "It's not necessary for the coordinates to be evenly spaced. Both pcolormesh() and contourf() can produce plots with nonuniform coordinates."
- No explicit requirement that coordinates must be sorted

### 4. Historical Context from GitHub Issues

GitHub Issue #1852: "2D pcolormesh plots are wrong when coordinate is not ascending order"
- Developers acknowledged this as a problem
- Discussed solutions: auto-sort, raise error, or warn
- Resolution appears to have been to raise an error for unsorted coordinates
- However, the current implementation doesn't fully address descending coordinates

### 5. check_monotonic Parameter Documentation
The function has a `check_monotonic` parameter that:
- When True, raises ValueError for non-monotonic coordinates
- Error message suggests using `sortby()` method
- However, the check allows BOTH ascending and descending monotonic sequences

## Key Documentation Gaps

1. **No explicit sorting requirement**: The documentation doesn't state that coordinates must be in ascending order for correct results.

2. **Ambiguous monotonic definition**: The check_monotonic parameter accepts descending sequences but the algorithm assumes ascending order.

3. **Purpose unclear**: The function's purpose of creating "interval breaks" for plotting isn't clearly documented.

4. **Private function**: As a private function, users shouldn't directly rely on it, but plotting functions that use it are affected.

## Conclusion

The documentation is insufficient to determine the intended behavior for unsorted or descending coordinates. The examples only show ascending sorted inputs, suggesting this might be the expected input format, but this is never explicitly stated. The presence of check_monotonic suggests some awareness of ordering issues, but its implementation (accepting descending sequences) contradicts the algorithm's assumptions.
