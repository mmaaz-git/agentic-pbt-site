## Documentation Analysis

### VariableCoder Documentation (xarray/coding/common.py)

The VariableCoder base class documentation explicitly states (lines 29-30):

"Subclasses should implement encode() and decode(), which should satisfy
the identity ``coder.decode(coder.encode(variable)) == variable``."

This is a clear contract that ALL coders extending VariableCoder must maintain the round-trip property. The CFDatetimeCoder is a subclass of VariableCoder and therefore inherits this requirement.

### CFDatetimeCoder Implementation

The implementation shows that the code is aware of potential precision loss:

1. Lines 1093-1098: The code detects when precision will be lost and emits a warning:
   "Times can't be serialized faithfully to int64 with requested units 'days since 2000-01-01'.
   Resolution of 'microseconds' needed. Serializing times to floating point instead."

2. Lines 1099-1109: When dtype is integer and allow_units_modification=True, it automatically adjusts units to preserve precision.

3. The code has mechanisms to:
   - Detect needed precision (lines 1086-1087)
   - Warn about precision loss
   - Optionally modify units to preserve precision

### Xarray User Documentation

The xarray documentation:
- States that it "automatically decodes datetime and timedelta arrays using CF conventions"
- Does not explicitly guarantee perfect round-trip precision
- Mentions limitations with datetime64[ns] range (1678-2262)
- Does not warn users about potential precision loss when using coarse units

### CF Conventions

The CF conventions define how time should be encoded but do not appear to mandate perfect round-trip precision. They focus on the format and interpretation of time units and calendars.

### Key Finding

The critical issue is that CFDatetimeCoder violates the explicitly documented contract in its parent class VariableCoder. The documentation clearly states that encode/decode must satisfy the round-trip identity, but the implementation knowingly violates this when it:
1. Emits a warning about precision loss
2. Continues with lossy encoding anyway

The warning acknowledges the violation but does not prevent it. Users relying on the documented contract would expect either:
1. The round-trip to work correctly (by auto-adjusting units or using appropriate dtype)
2. An error to be raised if the round-trip cannot be guaranteed

Instead, the code proceeds with silent data corruption after a warning.
