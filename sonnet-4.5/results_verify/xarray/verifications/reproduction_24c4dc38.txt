REPRODUCTION OF THE BUG REPORT

1. TEST EXECUTION:
   I successfully reproduced the bug using the provided test cases. All tests confirm the reported behavior.

2. CONFIRMED BEHAVIORS:
   a) Hash Instability Test:
      - Created a CombineKwargDefault object with old="old_value" and new="new_value"
      - Hash with use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults=False: 1571366748223955310
      - Hash with use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults=True: 2901693043261534959
      - Result: HASHES ARE DIFFERENT - the bug report is correct

   b) Dict Lookup Failure:
      - Inserted object into dict with OPTIONS['use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults']=False
      - Object found in dict with same settings: True
      - After changing OPTIONS to True, object lookup: False
      - Result: DICT LOOKUP FAILS - the bug report is correct

   c) Set Membership Failure:
      - Added object to set with OPTIONS['use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults']=False
      - Object found in set with same settings: True
      - After changing OPTIONS to True, membership test: False
      - Result: SET MEMBERSHIP FAILS - the bug report is correct

   d) Hypothesis Property Test:
      - The hypothesis test immediately failed with the error:
        "Hash changed from -8102420966924108686 to 4238894112 when options changed"
      - Result: PROPERTY-BASED TEST FAILS - the bug report is correct

3. ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION:
   - The _value property returns 'old_value' when use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults=False
   - The _value property returns 'new_value' when use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults=True
   - The __hash__ method returns hash(self._value), which changes with the global state
   - This is exactly as the bug report describes

4. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
   - The bug report accurately identifies the problematic code at lines 180-181
   - The root cause analysis pointing to the _value property dependency is correct
   - The practical impact demonstrations (dict/set failures) are reproducible
   - The proposed fix (hashing the immutable attributes) is technically sound

5. PYTHON CONTRACT VIOLATION:
   - The behavior violates Python's fundamental hash contract
   - Objects used as dict keys or in sets must have stable hashes
   - This is not just a theoretical issue - it causes actual failures in hash-based collections

CONCLUSION: The bug report is technically accurate and reproducible. All test cases provided demonstrate real failures that occur when the global OPTIONS state changes.
