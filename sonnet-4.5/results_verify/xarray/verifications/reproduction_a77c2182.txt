REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

Bug Report Validity: CONFIRMED

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug manifests exactly as described.

Test Execution:
1. The property-based test using Hypothesis correctly identifies the failure case. When run, it immediately finds an example where expand_dims() creates duplicate dimensions, specifically with dims=('dim_1',).

2. The simple reproduction case provided works exactly as reported:
   - Input: NamedArray with dims=('dim_1',)
   - Output after expand_dims(): dims=('dim_1', 'dim_1')
   - This creates duplicate dimensions

Additional Test Cases Confirmed:
- dims=('dim_0', 'dim_2') → expands to ('dim_2', 'dim_0', 'dim_2') ✓
- dims=('a', 'b', 'dim_3') → expands to ('dim_3', 'a', 'b', 'dim_3') ✓
- dims=('x', 'y') → expands to ('dim_2', 'x', 'y') (works correctly, no duplicates)

Key Observations:
1. The bug occurs specifically when the existing dimensions contain a name following the pattern 'dim_N' where N equals the number of dimensions in the array.

2. When expand_dims() is called without an explicit dim parameter, it generates a default name using f"dim_{len(dims)}", which can collide with existing dimension names.

3. The creation of duplicate dimensions triggers a UserWarning from the xarray codebase itself:
   "Duplicate dimension names present: dimensions {'dim_1'} appear more than once in dims=('dim_1', 'dim_1'). We do not yet support duplicate dimension names..."

4. The warning explicitly states that xarray does NOT support duplicate dimension names and that "most xarray functionality is likely to fail silently if you do not" fix them.

Root Cause:
The bug is in lines 187-188 of /xarray/namedarray/_array_api.py:
```python
if dim is _default:
    dim = f"dim_{len(dims)}"
```
This logic naively generates a dimension name based on the current number of dimensions without checking if that name already exists in the array's dimensions.
