## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Execution
I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The test demonstrates that:

1. **The function returns a mutable list**: Confirmed that `_load_static_files()` returns a `list` object (not tuple or other immutable type).

2. **The same object is returned on subsequent calls**: Verified that with `lru_cache`, the exact same object (same memory ID) is returned for all calls.

3. **Mutations persist across calls**: When modifying the returned list (e.g., setting `result[0] = "MUTATED"`), all subsequent calls return the mutated list.

### Technical Details
- Return type: `<class 'list'>` with 2 elements
- Object identity: All calls return the same object ID (e.g., 130604199876736)
- Mutation effect: Changing `second_call[0]` to "MUTATED" affected `first_call`, `second_call`, and `third_call` - all show "MUTATED"

### Property-Based Test
The property-based test from the bug report also fails as expected:
- The test tries to verify cache immutability
- It fails with "Cache should not be mutated by callers"
- This confirms the behavior described in the bug report

### Proposed Fix Validation
I tested the proposed fix (changing return type from list to tuple):
1. **Prevents mutation**: Tuples are immutable, so attempting `result[0] = "MUTATED"` raises `TypeError`
2. **Maintains compatibility**:
   - Unpacking still works: `icons_svg, css_style = _load_static_files()`
   - Indexing still works: `result[0]` and `result[1]`
3. **Preserves caching**: The tuple is still cached and reused

### Current Usage in Codebase
The function is called at line 305 of formatting_html.py:
```python
icons_svg, css_style = _load_static_files()
```
This usage pattern (unpacking into two variables) works identically with both list and tuple return types.

### Conclusion
The bug is real and reproducible. The function uses `@lru_cache` with a mutable return type (list), allowing callers to inadvertently mutate the cached value, affecting all subsequent calls. The proposed fix (returning tuple instead of list) would solve this issue while maintaining backward compatibility.
