TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

EVALUATION FOR EACH CATEGORY
-----------------------------

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
Arguments FOR:
- The code crashes with ZeroDivisionError on valid input (empty index)
- Empty PandasIndex objects can be created without error, making them valid inputs
- Documentation does not state empty indexes are unsupported
- Similar operations in pandas/numpy handle empty inputs gracefully
- The crash prevents normal operation in legitimate use cases (filtering that results in empty data)
- The fix is straightforward and maintains consistency with ecosystem conventions

Arguments AGAINST:
- None significant - this appears to be a clear oversight in edge case handling

INVALID
Arguments FOR:
- Could argue that rolling an empty sequence is undefined mathematically
Arguments AGAINST:
- Empty sequences are valid inputs throughout the pandas/numpy ecosystem
- The documentation doesn't exclude empty indexes
- Mathematical operations on empty sets typically return empty sets
- The crash is due to implementation detail (modulo), not fundamental impossibility

WONTFIX
Arguments FOR:
- Could argue empty indexes are rare edge cases
Arguments AGAINST:
- Empty results from filtering are common in data processing
- The fix is trivial (3-4 lines of code)
- Crash is severe (prevents entire pipeline from running)
- Not an obscure numerical edge case but a basic data structure state

DOCUMENTATION_FIX
Arguments FOR:
- Could document that empty indexes are not supported
Arguments AGAINST:
- This would be inconsistent with ecosystem conventions
- Would require users to add defensive checks everywhere
- The behavior (returning empty index) is obvious and expected
- Better to fix the code than document a limitation

FEATURE_REQUEST
Arguments FOR:
- Could frame as "add support for empty indexes"
Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not adding new functionality but fixing broken existing functionality
- PandasIndex already accepts empty indexes in its constructor
- The method signature already implies it should work on any PandasIndex

DETAILED REASONING
------------------
1. This is a crash on valid input - empty indexes are constructible and valid
2. The expected behavior is clear and consistent with ecosystem conventions
3. The bug has real-world impact on data processing pipelines
4. The fix is trivial and maintains backward compatibility
5. No documentation suggests this limitation is intentional
6. Similar methods throughout pandas/numpy handle empty inputs gracefully

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
This should be categorized as BUG. The code fails to handle a valid edge case that can occur in normal usage. The crash is due to an implementation oversight (not checking for zero before modulo) rather than any fundamental limitation. The expected behavior is clear from ecosystem conventions, and the fix is straightforward.
