## Documentation Analysis

1. **Function Nature**: `_wrap_datatree_repr` is an internal function (prefixed with underscore), indicating it's not part of the public API and is not documented in the official xarray documentation.

2. **Primary Documentation**: The only documentation for this function is its docstring within the source code itself (lines 438-473 in formatting_html.py).

3. **Docstring Content**: The docstring clearly states on line 465: "Default is True." for the `end` parameter.

4. **Actual Usage**: In the codebase, the function is called with explicit `end` parameter values:
   - Line 373: `_wrap_datatree_repr(datatree_node_repr(n, c), end=is_last)`
   - The caller explicitly passes the `end` value, so the default isn't relied upon here.

5. **Test Coverage**: The test suite (test_formatting_html.py) includes unit tests for both `end=True` and `end=False` cases but does not test the default behavior without specifying the parameter.

6. **Function Purpose**: Based on the docstring and tests, the function wraps HTML representation with a tee character:
   - When `end=False`: Creates a continuing line (├─)
   - When `end=True`: Creates an ending line (└─)

The documentation inconsistency is clear: The docstring states the default is `True`, but the function signature defines it as `False`. Since this is an internal function and the docstring is the only documentation, this is a documentation error within the code itself.
