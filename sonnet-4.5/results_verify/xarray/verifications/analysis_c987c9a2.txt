# Triage Analysis for Bug Report

## Categorization Considerations

### 1. BUG
**Arguments FOR this being a BUG:**
- The function produces mathematically incorrect results: interval breaks that don't cover the input data range
- This leads to incorrect visualizations where data points fall outside plotted regions
- The function is used by public plotting APIs (pcolormesh) that users rely on
- The behavior is objectively wrong - interval breaks should logically cover the data range they're meant to represent
- GitHub issue #1852 shows developers previously acknowledged similar issues as bugs
- The function works correctly for ascending coordinates but fails for descending ones, showing inconsistent behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Function is private (starts with underscore), suggesting internal use only
- Documentation examples only show ascending sorted inputs, possibly implying this is the expected format

### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR INVALID:**
- Function is private/internal, users shouldn't directly call it
- All docstring examples use ascending sorted coordinates
- The function name doesn't promise to handle all input types

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Public plotting functions that use this are affected
- Mathematical correctness (interval breaks covering data range) is a reasonable expectation
- Even private functions should work correctly for their intended purpose

### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR WONTFIX:**
- Could be considered an edge case since most plotting data is pre-sorted
- Workaround exists: users can sort their data before plotting
- Performance concerns about auto-sorting large datasets

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - descending coordinates are common in scientific data
- Silent incorrect results are worse than errors
- The bug affects data visualization accuracy, which is critical

### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly state sorting requirements
- The check_monotonic parameter's behavior is confusing (accepts descending but algorithm needs ascending)
- Adding documentation about sorting requirements would help users

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function produces mathematically incorrect results, not just unexpected ones
- Documentation alone won't fix the incorrect interval calculations
- Users expect plotting functions to handle their data correctly

### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Supporting descending/unsorted coordinates could be seen as a new feature
- The function might have been designed only for ascending coordinates

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is about correctness, not adding new functionality
- The function already attempts to handle different coordinate types (has monotonic checking)
- Producing correct interval breaks is core functionality, not a feature

## Analysis Summary

The key factors are:
1. **Mathematical incorrectness**: The interval breaks don't cover the data range, which is objectively wrong
2. **Impact on users**: Public plotting functions produce incorrect visualizations
3. **Reasonable expectations**: Users expect plotting to work with descending coordinates (common in scientific data)
4. **Prior acknowledgment**: GitHub #1852 shows similar issues were treated as bugs
5. **Silent failure**: The function produces wrong results without warning (when check_monotonic=False)

## Conclusion

This is a **BUG** because:
1. The function produces mathematically incorrect results (interval breaks that don't cover the input range)
2. It affects public plotting APIs that users depend on for accurate visualizations
3. The incorrect behavior occurs silently, potentially leading to wrong scientific interpretations
4. The function works correctly for ascending coordinates but fails for descending ones, showing it's a correctness issue, not a missing feature
5. Interval breaks that don't cover their data range violate the fundamental purpose of the function

While the function is private, it's used by public APIs, and its incorrect behavior has real impact on users. The fact that it works for ascending but not descending coordinates indicates a logic error rather than intentional limitation.
