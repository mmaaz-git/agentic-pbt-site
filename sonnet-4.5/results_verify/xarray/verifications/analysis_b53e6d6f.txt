## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The function is private (underscore prefix), not part of public API
- No explicit documentation states the return value must be immutable
- Callers could be expected to know not to mutate cached values

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The function name and purpose clearly indicate static, unchanging content
- The caching decorator implies the same object should be returned
- Internal functions should still behave correctly
- The bug can cause real problems in production

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID - The bug is real and violates reasonable expectations

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- It's an internal function, not exposed to users
- Developers using internal functions should know not to mutate cached values
- The fix is trivial but might have minimal real-world impact

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental caching issue
- The bug could cause hard-to-debug rendering failures
- The fix is simple and improves code robustness
- Even internal code should follow best practices
- Returning mutable cached objects is a well-known anti-pattern

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX - This is a legitimate bug that should be fixed

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could argue that immutability is a new feature, not a bug fix
- The current code "works" if callers don't mutate the result

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The function already intends to provide consistent static content
- The caching is already there but implemented incorrectly
- This is a bug fix, not a feature addition

**Verdict:** NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing existing broken behavior

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state the return value is immutable
- Could update docs to warn against mutating the return value

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- "Static files" inherently implies immutability
- The caching pattern is broken regardless of documentation
- Fixing the code is the right solution, not documenting the bug

**Verdict:** NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The code needs fixing, not the docs

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
1. **Violates caching semantics:** `@lru_cache` should return consistent results, but mutation breaks this
2. **Breaks static file contract:** "Static" means unchanging, but the content can be mutated
3. **Real impact:** Can cause HTML rendering failures in Jupyter notebooks and other displays
4. **Well-known anti-pattern:** Returning mutable objects from cached functions is a classic bug
5. **Simple fix available:** Returning a tuple instead of list prevents the issue
6. **Reproducible:** Both property-based and manual tests confirm the bug
7. **Semantic violation:** The function's purpose (loading static resources) is violated

**Verdict:** IS A BUG - Clear violation of caching principles and static resource semantics

### Final Analysis
This is a legitimate BUG. The function uses `@lru_cache` to cache a mutable list, allowing any caller to corrupt the cached static resources. This violates:
- The principle of immutable cached values
- The semantic meaning of "static files"
- The expected behavior based on the function's purpose
- Best practices for caching implementations

The fix is straightforward (return tuple instead of list) and prevents future corruption of cached static resources.
