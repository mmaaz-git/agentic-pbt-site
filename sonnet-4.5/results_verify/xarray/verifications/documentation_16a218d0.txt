## Documentation Analysis

### Function Discovery
`build_grid_chunks` is an **internal function** in the xarray library, located in `xarray/backends/chunks.py`. It is not exposed in the public API.

### Public API Status
- The function is NOT exported in `xarray/backends/__init__.py`
- It is NOT mentioned in the official xarray documentation
- It is only imported internally by:
  - `xarray/backends/zarr.py` (indirectly via grid_rechunk)
  - `xarray/tests/test_backends_chunks.py` (for testing)

### Function Purpose (Inferred from Code)
Based on code analysis:
1. The function is used internally by `grid_rechunk` function
2. It appears to generate chunk sizes for a Zarr grid storage system
3. It's called with `sum(var_chunks)` as the size parameter, meaning it should partition that total size into chunks

### Documentation Findings
1. **No docstring exists** for this function
2. **No public documentation** - This is an internal implementation detail
3. **Limited test coverage** - Only 5 test cases, all with size >= chunk_size:
   - (10, 3, slice(1, 11), (2, 3, 3, 2))
   - (10, 3, slice(None, None), (3, 3, 3, 1))
   - (10, 3, None, (3, 3, 3, 1))
   - (10, 3, slice(None, 10), (3, 3, 3, 1))
   - (10, 3, slice(0, None), (3, 3, 3, 1))

### Implicit Contract
From the usage in `grid_rechunk`:
- The function is passed `sum(var_chunks)` as the size
- The result is expected to be "nd_grid_chunks" that align with variable chunks
- The sum of returned chunks MUST equal the input size for proper data alignment

### Comment Analysis
The only comment in the function (line 145):
```python
# Generate the zarr chunks inside the region of this dim
```
This confirms the function's purpose is to generate Zarr storage chunks.

### Conclusion
Since this is an internal function without documentation, the expected behavior must be inferred from:
1. Mathematical necessity: Chunks must partition the dimension (sum equals size)
2. Usage context: Used for Zarr grid storage alignment
3. Common sense: You cannot have more data in chunks than the actual data size

The lack of documentation doesn't excuse the bug - the fundamental invariant that chunks must sum to the total size is a mathematical requirement for any partitioning function.
