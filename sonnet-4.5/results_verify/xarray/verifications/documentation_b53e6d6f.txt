## Documentation Analysis

### Function Documentation
The function `_load_static_files()` has a docstring that states:
```python
"""Lazily load the resource files into memory the first time they are needed"""
```

This docstring implies:
1. The function should load resource files (static HTML/CSS) lazily
2. Resources should be loaded "the first time they are needed" and presumably cached
3. The content should be stable and consistent across calls

### Naming Convention
- The underscore prefix (`_load_static_files`) indicates this is a private/internal function
- This is not part of the public API and is not documented in the official xarray API reference
- Being internal doesn't excuse incorrect behavior - it should still work correctly for internal usage

### Usage Context
The function is used internally by `formatting_html.py` to provide HTML representation for xarray objects:
- Line 305: `icons_svg, css_style = _load_static_files()`
- The results are used to inject SVG icons and CSS styling into HTML output
- This is called when generating HTML representations for Jupyter notebooks and other HTML displays

### Expected Behavior from Context
Based on how it's used:
1. The function should provide consistent static content for HTML rendering
2. The SVG and CSS content should never change during runtime
3. Multiple calls should return identical content
4. The caching is for performance optimization (avoid re-reading files)

### Documentation Finding
There is NO explicit documentation stating:
- Whether the returned value should be immutable
- Whether callers are allowed to modify the returned list
- What guarantees the function provides about consistency

However, the semantic meaning is clear:
- "Static files" by definition should not change
- "Lazily load... the first time" implies subsequent calls should return the same content
- The use of `@lru_cache` decorator strongly suggests the intent is to return the same cached content

### Conclusion
While not explicitly documented, the function name, docstring, usage pattern, and caching decorator all strongly indicate that this function should return consistent, unchanging static content. The current implementation violates this implicit contract by returning a mutable list that can be corrupted by callers.
