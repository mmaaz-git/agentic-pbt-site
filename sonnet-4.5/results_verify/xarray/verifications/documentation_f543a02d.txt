# Documentation Analysis

## Primary Documentation Source
The primary documentation for `CombinedLock` is its class docstring in the source code at lines 211-214 of `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/xarray_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xarray/backends/locks.py`:

```
"""A combination of multiple locks.

Like a locked door, a CombinedLock is locked if any of its constituent
locks are locked.
"""
```

## Key Documentation Points

1. **Clear Contract**: The docstring explicitly states that "a CombinedLock is locked if any of its constituent locks are locked." This is an unambiguous specification.

2. **Analogy Used**: The "locked door" analogy reinforces the expected behavior - a door with multiple locks is considered locked if ANY of those locks are engaged.

3. **Expected Behavior**: Based on this documentation:
   - If NO constituent locks are locked → `locked()` should return `False`
   - If ANY constituent locks are locked → `locked()` should return `True`
   - If ALL constituent locks are locked → `locked()` should return `True`

## External Documentation
- No external API documentation was found for `CombinedLock` (404 error on xarray docs)
- The class appears to be part of the public API (accessible via `xarray.backends.locks.CombinedLock`)
- The class follows the standard Python locking protocol with methods like `acquire()`, `release()`, `locked()`, and context manager support

## Related Documentation
The `threading.Lock.locked()` method documentation states:
"Return whether the lock is in the locked state."

This establishes the standard behavior that `locked()` should return a boolean indicating the current lock state.

## Documentation Assessment
The documentation is:
1. **Clear and unambiguous** about the expected behavior
2. **Consistent** with Python's standard locking conventions
3. **Sufficient** to determine that the current implementation is incorrect

The bug violates the documented contract. When no locks are acquired, the CombinedLock should NOT be considered locked, but the current implementation returns `True` anyway.
