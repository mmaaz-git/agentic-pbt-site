## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report, but only in the fallback implementation that xarray provides for NumPy < 2.0. The bug does NOT manifest in the current test environment because NumPy 2.3.0 is installed, which has its own native `isdtype` function.

### Key Findings

1. **Environment Context**:
   - NumPy version: 2.3.0 (has native isdtype)
   - xarray uses NumPy's native isdtype when available (NumPy >= 2.0)
   - The bug is in xarray's fallback implementation (lines 54-75 in npcompat.py)

2. **Bug Confirmation**:
   When testing the fallback implementation directly (by copying the code), the bug occurs exactly as described:
   - Input: `np.int64(5)` with kind `"integral"`
   - Expected: Should return `True`
   - Actual: `TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type, a tuple of types, or a union`
   - Cause: Line 73 passes a set to `isinstance()` instead of a tuple

3. **Test Results**:
   - The Hypothesis test fails, but with NumPy 2.3.0's error message (not xarray's bug)
   - NumPy 2.3.0's isdtype rejects scalar values with: "dtype argument must be a NumPy dtype"
   - The fallback code (when tested in isolation) produces the exact error from the bug report

4. **Code Analysis**:
   The bug is on line 73 of xarray/compat/npcompat.py:
   ```python
   translated_kinds = {kind_mapping[k] for k in str_kinds} | type_kinds  # This is a set
   if isinstance(dtype, np.generic):
       return isinstance(dtype, translated_kinds)  # BUG: passes set to isinstance()
   ```

5. **Scope of Bug**:
   - Only affects environments with NumPy < 2.0
   - Only affects calls with numpy scalar values (instances of np.generic)
   - Does not affect dtype objects or type classes

### Conclusion
The bug is real and exists in xarray's fallback implementation. The fix proposed (converting the set to a tuple) is correct and would resolve the issue for NumPy < 2.0 environments.
