DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Review Summary:

1. Base Index.roll() Documentation (from source code comments):
   - States: "Roll this index by an offset along one or more dimensions."
   - Notes it "can be re-implemented in subclasses of Index"
   - Default behavior returns None if not re-implemented
   - No explicit mention of how to handle empty indexes

2. DataArray.roll() Documentation:
   - Describes roll as rotating array elements along dimensions
   - Treats dimensions as "periodic" (circular)
   - Does not create missing values
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly address empty array behavior
   - Examples show normal usage but no edge cases

3. NumPy Compatibility:
   - NumPy's roll() function handles empty arrays gracefully (returns empty array)
   - This sets a precedent for expected behavior in the scientific Python ecosystem

4. Implicit Expectations:
   - Rolling is a circular shift operation
   - An empty collection has no elements to shift
   - The mathematical identity for roll on empty should be the empty collection itself
   - This is consistent with other array operations (e.g., sort([]) = [], reverse([]) = [])

5. Documentation Gaps:
   - No explicit documentation found for PandasIndex.roll() specifically
   - Base class documentation doesn't specify edge case handling
   - No warning about potential errors with empty indexes
   - No statement that empty indexes are unsupported

Conclusion:
The documentation does not explicitly state how empty indexes should be handled, but:
1. The operation is mathematically well-defined for empty collections
2. NumPy (which xarray builds upon) handles this case gracefully
3. There's no documentation suggesting empty indexes should raise errors
4. The current error (ZeroDivisionError) is clearly unintended - it's an implementation bug, not a deliberate design choice
