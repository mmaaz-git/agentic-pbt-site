DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Python Documentation on __hash__:
----------------------------------
According to the official Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__):

1. Core requirement: "objects which compare equal have the same hash value"

2. Immutability requirement: "If a class defines mutable objects and implements __eq__(), it should not implement __hash__()"
   - This is because "the implementation of hashable collections requires that a key's hash value is immutable"
   - Objects used in sets and as dict keys MUST have stable hash values

3. The documentation strongly implies (though doesn't explicitly state word-for-word) that hash values must remain constant during an object's lifetime when used in hashable collections.

CombineKwargDefault Documentation:
-----------------------------------
1. Class docstring (line 152-154): "Object that handles deprecation cycle for kwarg default values. Similar to ReprObject"
   - No explicit documentation about hashability requirements
   - No warning that hash values may change

2. The class is used throughout xarray as default parameter values in combine functions:
   - Used in combine.py, concat.py, merge.py, alignment.py
   - Passed as function parameters with type hints like `CompatOptions | CombineKwargDefault`

3. The xarray documentation for set_options shows that use_new_combine_kwarg_defaults controls which default values are used, but doesn't mention hash stability.

Key Finding:
------------
There is NO documentation indicating that:
1. CombineKwargDefault objects should have mutable hashes
2. Users should expect hash values to change based on global state
3. These objects should not be used in sets or as dictionary keys

The class implements __hash__ and __eq__, indicating it's intended to be hashable. The fact that the hash changes violates Python's implicit contract for hashable objects. The behavior is undocumented and unexpected.

Conclusion:
-----------
The bug report correctly identifies a violation of Python's hash contract. The documentation does not specify or justify this behavior as intentional. Objects that implement __hash__ are expected to have stable hash values, especially when they can be used in collections.
