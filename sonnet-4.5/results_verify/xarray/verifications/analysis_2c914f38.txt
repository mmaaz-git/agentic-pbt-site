## Bug Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
1. The function returns a mutable cached object that can be corrupted by any caller
2. The function name contains "static" which strongly implies immutability
3. Python's lru_cache documentation warns against caching mutable objects that need to be distinct on each call
4. The bug can lead to corrupted HTML/CSS rendering for xarray objects
5. The fix is straightforward and makes the code more robust (returning tuple instead of list)
6. The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise - developers expect cached values to be safe from external modification

**Arguments Against:**
- None identified. This is a clear bug.

### INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The function is internal (underscore prefix) so external users shouldn't be calling it directly

**Arguments Against:**
- Even internal functions should follow good practices
- The bug affects the correctness of the caching mechanism
- Internal code within xarray could still accidentally modify the cached value

### WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- The function is only used once in the codebase, and that usage doesn't modify the returned list
- It's an internal function not meant for external use
- The current usage pattern (unpacking) doesn't exhibit the bug

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug represents a latent defect that could manifest if the code evolves
- Good defensive programming practices dictate fixing such issues
- The fix is trivial (changing list to tuple) with no performance impact
- Future maintainers might use this function differently and encounter the bug

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be viewed as a request for better immutability guarantees

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not new functionality but fixing incorrect behavior
- Caching mutable objects is a bug, not a missing feature
- The expected behavior (immutable cached values) is standard practice

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state the return value should be immutable

**Arguments Against:**
- The behavior is incorrect regardless of documentation
- The function name and purpose strongly imply immutability
- This is a code bug, not a documentation issue

### Conclusion
This is a **BUG**. The function violates fundamental caching principles by returning a mutable cached object. While the current usage doesn't trigger the issue, it represents a correctness problem that should be fixed. The proposed solution (returning a tuple instead of a list) is elegant, has no downsides, and prevents potential future issues.
