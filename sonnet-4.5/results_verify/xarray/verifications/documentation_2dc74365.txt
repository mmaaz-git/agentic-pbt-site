## Documentation Analysis for xarray.core.formatting.pretty_print

### Function Documentation

The function `pretty_print` is defined in xarray/core/formatting.py at line 41-47. The docstring states:

```
Given an object `x`, call `str(x)` and format the returned string so
that it is numchars long, padding with trailing spaces or truncating with
ellipses as necessary
```

### Key Points from Documentation:

1. **Purpose**: The function should format a string to be exactly `numchars` characters long.

2. **Behavior**:
   - If the string is shorter than `numchars`, it should pad with trailing spaces
   - If the string is longer than `numchars`, it should truncate with ellipses

3. **Contract**: The documentation explicitly states the output should be "numchars long", which is a clear contract about the length of the returned string.

### Implementation Details:

The function implementation is:
```python
def pretty_print(x, numchars: int):
    s = maybe_truncate(x, numchars)
    return s + " " * max(numchars - len(s), 0)
```

It calls `maybe_truncate` which is defined at lines 50-54:
```python
def maybe_truncate(obj, maxlen=500):
    s = str(obj)
    if len(s) > maxlen:
        s = s[: (maxlen - 3)] + "..."
    return s
```

### API Status:

- `pretty_print` is exported from `xarray.core.formatting` module (confirmed by checking dir() output)
- It's not part of the main xarray public API (not in `dir(xarray)`)
- This appears to be an internal utility function used for formatting display output within xarray
- The function is used internally in xarray, specifically in `summarize_attr` (line 373) and other formatting functions

### Documentation Coverage:

- No external documentation was found on docs.xarray.dev (404 error)
- The function only has inline docstring documentation
- The docstring is clear about the expected behavior: output should be exactly `numchars` long

### Conclusion:

The documentation (docstring) clearly states that the function should return a string that is exactly `numchars` long. This is an unambiguous contract that the implementation should fulfill for all valid values of `numchars`.
