# According to mathematical definitions, DCT Type 1 is not defined for N < 2
# Let's verify this mathematically

# The DCT-I formula is:
# X_k = 1/2(x_0 + (-1)^k x_{N-1}) + ∑_{n=1}^{N-2} x_n cos[π/(N-1) nk]

# For N=1 (single element):
# - N-1 = 0, which makes π/(N-1) = π/0 = undefined (division by zero)
# - The sum from n=1 to N-2 = -1 doesn't make sense (empty sum)
