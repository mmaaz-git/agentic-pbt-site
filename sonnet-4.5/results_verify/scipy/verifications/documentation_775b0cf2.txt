## Documentation Analysis for scipy.signal.windows.tukey

### Official Documentation Findings:

1. **Alpha Parameter Range**: The documentation clearly states that alpha is a float parameter with a range of 0 to 1. It represents the fraction of the window inside the cosine tapered region.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - When alpha = 0: The function should return a rectangular window (all ones)
   - When alpha = 1: The function should return a Hann window
   - The documentation does NOT specify what happens for extremely small positive values of alpha

3. **Return Value Specification**: The function should return an ndarray window with maximum value normalized to 1. The documentation states this should be a valid window array - implicitly meaning all values should be finite and valid.

4. **Source Code Observations** (lines 931-946):
   - Line 931: `if alpha <= 0:` returns all ones
   - Line 933: `elif alpha >= 1.0:` returns hann window
   - Lines 944 and 946 contain divisions by alpha:
     - `w1 = 0.5 * (1 + xp.cos(xp.pi * (-1 + 2.0*n1/alpha/(M-1))))`
     - `w3 = 0.5 * (1 + xp.cos(xp.pi * (-2.0/alpha + 1 + 2.0*n3/alpha/(M-1))))`

5. **Critical Observation**: The documentation does not explicitly address numerical stability issues or provide warnings about extremely small alpha values. However, it does specify that alpha should be in the range [0, 1], and alpha=0 is handled as a special case that returns all ones.

6. **Implicit Expectations**: Window functions in signal processing are expected to produce finite, valid numerical values for all documented valid inputs. NaN values would not be considered valid window values.

### Key Finding:
The documentation specifies alpha should be in [0, 1] range, and the code specifically handles alpha <= 0 as a special case. However, there's no documented behavior or warning about numerical instability for very small positive alpha values that could cause overflow in the division operations.
