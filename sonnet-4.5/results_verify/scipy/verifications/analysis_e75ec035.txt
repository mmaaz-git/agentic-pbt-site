Bug Triage Analysis
===================

## Consideration for Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation explicitly states "the maximum value normalized to 1" without qualifiers
- The deviation is consistent and reproducible for all odd M values
- The root cause is clearly identified (coefficient sum exceeds 1.0)
- The fix is straightforward (normalize coefficients to sum to exactly 1.0)
- The function is used for "accurate measurements" where precision matters
- The documentation shows awareness of edge cases (even M) but doesn't mention this tolerance

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The deviation is extremely small (3×10⁻⁹ or 3 parts per billion)
- In practical applications, this difference is negligible
- The coefficients likely come from a published reference (D'Antona & Ferrero 2006)

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The error is only 3×10⁻⁹, which is practically insignificant
- No real-world application would be affected by this tiny deviation
- The coefficients are from a published reference and changing them might be considered altering a standard implementation
- The computational cost of runtime normalization might not be worth it for such a small error

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation makes an explicit claim about normalization
- The fix is trivial (just use properly normalized coefficients)
- For a function used in "accurate measurements", even small errors matter
- Some users may have strict validation requirements

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that floating-point arithmetic inherently has precision limits
- The term "normalized to 1" could be interpreted as "approximately 1"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't mention any tolerance or approximation
- The error is systematic (always exactly 1.000000003 for odd M), not random floating-point noise
- The bug report correctly identifies a real discrepancy between documentation and implementation

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The implementation might be considered correct if it follows the reference (D'Antona & Ferrero)
- Could update documentation to say "normalized to approximately 1" or "normalized to 1 within numerical precision"
- Adding a note about the coefficient sum would clarify the behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code can easily be fixed to match the existing documentation
- Users expect exact normalization when documentation says "normalized to 1"
- Changing documentation to accommodate a tiny implementation error seems backwards

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as requesting enhanced precision beyond original design

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly about fixing existing behavior to match documentation
- Not asking for new functionality, just correcting a normalization error
- The documentation already promises this behavior

## Conclusion

This is a **BUG**. While the deviation is tiny (3×10⁻⁹), the documentation makes an explicit, unqualified claim that "the maximum value normalized to 1". The implementation violates this contract in a consistent, reproducible way for all odd M values. The root cause is clearly identified (coefficient sum = 1.000000003), and the fix is trivial.

Key factors:
1. Clear contract violation: Documentation promises normalization to 1, code delivers 1.000000003
2. The function is specifically for "accurate measurements" where precision matters
3. The fix is simple and doesn't break any functionality
4. The error is systematic, not random floating-point noise

While one could argue this is WONTFIX due to the tiny magnitude, the explicit documentation promise and the trivial nature of the fix make this a valid bug report. Users who rely on the documented behavior for validation or testing (as the bug reporter does with property-based testing) have a legitimate expectation that the function behaves as documented.
