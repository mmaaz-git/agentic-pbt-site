BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

Let me analyze this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID - Why it might be INVALID:
   - The function correctly rejects N=1 inputs as documented
   - The documentation explicitly states "DCT-I is only supported for input size > 1"
   - The mathematical constraint is real (division by N-1 = 0)

   Why it's NOT INVALID:
   - The error message is objectively wrong: it says "zero-length FFT" when length is 1
   - This is not about undefined behavior - the behavior is documented
   - The issue is about the quality and accuracy of the error message

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - The function works correctly (rejects invalid input)
   - This is just about error message text, not functionality
   - Could be considered a trivial improvement

   Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
   - The misleading error causes real user confusion and wastes debugging time
   - The fix is simple and improves user experience
   - Other DCT types handle N=1 correctly, making the inconsistent error confusing

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Asking for better error messages could be seen as an enhancement
   - The current behavior (rejecting N=1) is correct

   Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This isn't asking for new functionality
   - The error message is factually incorrect (not just suboptimal)
   - Fixing misleading errors is maintenance, not a new feature

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation could be clearer about what error to expect

   Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation correctly states the size > 1 requirement
   - The problem is in the code's error message, not the docs
   - The docs don't promise any specific error message

5. BUG - Why it IS a BUG:
   - The error message is factually incorrect: says "zero-length" when length is 1
   - This misleads users about the actual problem
   - Users waste time debugging non-existent issues with their array size
   - The error message contradicts observable facts (array.size = 1, not 0)
   - While the behavior (rejecting N=1) is correct, the error reporting is broken
   - Good error messages are part of the API contract

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a BUG. While the function correctly rejects N=1 inputs as documented, the error message "zero-length FFT requested" is factually incorrect and misleading. The array has length 1, not 0. This causes unnecessary confusion and debugging overhead for users. The error message should accurately describe the actual constraint: "DCT Type I requires input length >= 2".
