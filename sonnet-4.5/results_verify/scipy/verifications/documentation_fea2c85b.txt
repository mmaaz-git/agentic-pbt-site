Documentation Analysis for scipy.datasets User-Agent Headers

1. Official SciPy Documentation:
The official scipy.datasets documentation (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/datasets.html) does not mention any specifics about User-Agent headers or HTTP request headers. It only documents:
- How datasets are retrieved using the Pooch library
- Cache location information
- Available utility methods (download_all and clear_cache)
- Individual dataset functions (ascent, face, electrocardiogram)

There is NO specification about what User-Agent headers should contain, whether they should include version numbers, or that they should be consistent across different functions.

2. GitHub Issue #21879:
The GitHub issue referenced by both functions (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/21879) was created to address 403 Forbidden errors when downloading datasets. The issue discussion shows:
- The problem was GitHub restricting requests without User-Agent headers (likely due to bot traffic)
- The proposed solution was to add a User-Agent header to identify the source
- NO specific format for the User-Agent was mandated in the issue discussion
- NO requirement was stated that version numbers must be included
- NO requirement was stated that all functions must use identical User-Agent strings

3. Function Documentation:
Neither the fetch_data() nor download_all() function docstrings mention anything about User-Agent headers. These are implementation details not exposed in the API documentation.

4. Conclusion:
The documentation does not specify:
- That User-Agent headers must be consistent across functions
- That User-Agent headers must include version numbers
- Any particular format for User-Agent headers

This appears to be an internal implementation detail with no documented requirements for consistency or format.
