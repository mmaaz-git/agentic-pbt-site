BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Considering each possible categorization:

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
-----------------------
Arguments FOR:
1. Clear inconsistent behavior: The same invalid input produces different results based on filesystem state
2. Validation code exists and is intentional (lines 36-42 in _utils.py)
3. The validation check is skipped due to early return, not by design
4. Violates principle of fail-fast validation - invalid input should be rejected immediately
5. Creates unpredictable behavior for users - code that works in testing (empty cache) may fail in production (with cache)
6. The fix is straightforward and improves code consistency

Arguments AGAINST:
1. When cache doesn't exist, there's nothing to clear anyway, so no harm is done
2. The validation might be considered unnecessary when no operation will be performed

INVALID
-------
Arguments FOR:
1. Documentation doesn't explicitly promise validation of dataset callables
2. The function technically works correctly when cache doesn't exist (nothing to clear)

Arguments AGAINST:
1. Validation code clearly exists and is intended to run
2. The error message is user-facing and helpful
3. Inconsistent behavior is not desirable even if undocumented

WONTFIX
--------
Arguments FOR:
1. Edge case that may not affect many users in practice
2. No actual harm occurs - invalid datasets just don't clear anything

Arguments AGAINST:
1. Not an obscure edge case - it's a basic input validation issue
2. Inconsistent behavior is problematic for testing and debugging
3. The fix is simple and low-risk

FEATURE_REQUEST
----------------
Arguments FOR:
1. Could be viewed as requesting consistent validation where none was explicitly promised

Arguments AGAINST:
1. Validation code already exists - this is about fixing existing behavior
2. Not asking for new functionality, just consistent application of existing validation

DOCUMENTATION_FIX
-----------------
Arguments FOR:
1. Could document that validation only occurs when cache exists

Arguments AGAINST:
1. This would document a bug rather than fix it
2. The inconsistent behavior is clearly unintentional
3. The validation code exists for a reason

FINAL ASSESSMENT
----------------
This is a valid BUG. The code contains explicit validation logic that is intended to run but is bypassed due to an early return. This creates inconsistent behavior where the same invalid input is sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected based on filesystem state. The validation code is clearly intentional (with helpful error messages), and skipping it is an implementation oversight, not a design choice.

The bug affects the predictability and testability of the API, and the proposed fix correctly moves the validation before the early return to ensure consistent behavior.
