BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

Test 1: Weight Sum Verification
- The reported weights [0.21, 0.71, 0.07] DO sum to 0.99 as claimed
- The sum is exactly 0.99, with a floating-point difference of 0.010000000000000009 from 1.0
- The property test correctly fails with the assertion error

Test 2: Standard Weight Verification
- ITU-R BT.601 weights (0.299, 0.587, 0.114) sum to exactly 1.0
- ITU-R BT.709 weights (0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722) sum to exactly 1.0
- Both standard formulas maintain sum = 1.0 for proper luminance preservation

Test 3: Scipy Implementation Verification
- Confirmed the scipy source code uses weights (0.21, 0.71, 0.07)
- These appear to be incorrectly rounded versions of BT.709 standard:
  - 0.2126 rounded to 0.21 (difference: -0.0026)
  - 0.7152 rounded to 0.71 (difference: -0.0052)
  - 0.0722 rounded to 0.07 (difference: -0.0022)

Test 4: Practical Impact Assessment
- Tested on actual scipy.datasets.face() function
- Manual calculation with scipy weights matches the library output exactly
- Comparison with proper BT.709 weights shows:
  - Average pixel difference: 1.12 (out of 255 scale)
  - Maximum pixel difference: 3
  - 82.86% of pixels are affected (different values)

Test 5: Technical Accuracy of Bug Report
- The bug report is technically accurate about the weights summing to 0.99
- The claim that this causes images to be "1% darker" is mathematically correct
- The suggested fix (using exact BT.709 weights) would resolve the issue

Conclusion on Reproduction:
The bug report's technical claims are accurate and reproducible. The weights do sum to 0.99 instead of 1.0, and this does cause grayscale conversions to be slightly darker than they would be with standard conversion formulas. The practical impact is small but measurable, with most pixels being 1-2 values darker on a 0-255 scale.
