## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report assumes that User-Agent headers must be consistent across different functions, but there is no documentation or specification requiring this. The GitHub issue #21879 only required adding *some* User-Agent to avoid 403 errors, not that all User-Agents must be identical. Different internal functions having different User-Agent formats is not necessarily incorrect behavior if not specified otherwise.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The inconsistency is real and verifiable. Both functions reference the same GitHub issue, suggesting they were modified for the same purpose. The fact that one includes version information and the other doesn't appears to be an oversight rather than intentional design.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an extremely minor inconsistency that has no functional impact. Both User-Agent headers successfully prevent the 403 errors they were meant to address. The difference between "SciPy" and "SciPy X.Y.Z" is trivial and unlikely to affect any real-world usage. Server administrators can still identify that requests come from SciPy, just without version details in one case.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Including version numbers in User-Agent headers is a standard practice that helps with debugging and analytics. Since one function already does this correctly, aligning the other function would be a trivial fix that improves consistency and provides better information to server operators.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code behavior itself is reasonable - both functions work correctly. The issue is that there's no documentation explaining what the expected User-Agent format should be. Adding documentation to clarify whether version numbers should be included would prevent future confusion.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
User-Agent headers are an internal implementation detail not exposed in the public API. Users don't need to know about them, and documenting internal HTTP headers would be unnecessary. This is more about code consistency than documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding version information to the download_all User-Agent could be seen as a new feature - enhancing the existing functionality to provide more detailed information to servers. The current implementation works; this would be an enhancement to provide additional metadata.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't really adding new functionality but rather fixing an inconsistency between two similar functions. Since fetch_data already includes the version, this is more about bringing download_all up to the same standard rather than adding something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
Two functions that serve similar purposes and reference the same GitHub issue for adding User-Agent headers have different implementations. This suggests one was updated correctly and the other was not, representing an implementation oversight. Consistency in library behavior is important for maintainability.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There's no documented requirement for User-Agent consistency. Both functions work correctly as intended - they successfully download files without 403 errors. The difference in User-Agent strings doesn't break any functionality or violate any specification.

## Overall Consideration
This bug report identifies a real but extremely minor inconsistency in the scipy.datasets module. Both fetch_data() and download_all() add User-Agent headers referencing the same GitHub issue (#21879), but fetch_data includes the SciPy version while download_all does not.

The key question is whether this inconsistency constitutes a bug or is simply an unimportant implementation detail. The GitHub issue that prompted adding these headers was about avoiding 403 errors, which both implementations successfully achieve. There's no documentation specifying that User-Agent headers must be consistent or include version numbers.

While including version information in User-Agent headers is generally good practice and the inconsistency suggests an oversight, this is such a trivial issue with no functional impact that it falls into the category of issues that most maintainers would consider not worth fixing. The code works correctly, causes no errors, and the inconsistency only affects server-side logging in a minor way. This is exactly the type of technically-correct-but-practically-irrelevant issue that maintainers typically close as WONTFIX.
