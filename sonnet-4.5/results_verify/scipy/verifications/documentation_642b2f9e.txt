DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

I have thoroughly reviewed the documentation for scipy.fftpack.hilbert and scipy.fftpack.ihilbert.
Here are the key findings:

1. MATHEMATICAL DEFINITIONS FROM DOCUMENTATION:

   hilbert: y_j = sqrt(-1)*sign(j) * x_j, y_0 = 0
   ihilbert: y_j = -sqrt(-1)*sign(j) * x_j, y_0 = 0

2. CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION STATEMENTS:

   a) From hilbert documentation:
      - "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero."
      - "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x"

   b) The documentation does NOT state that:
      - ihilbert(hilbert(x)) == x (in general)
      - These functions are perfect inverses of each other
      - The functions preserve all information

3. INVERSE RELATIONSHIP CLAIMS:

   - The ihilbert function is described as "Return inverse Hilbert transform"
   - BUT the documentation only guarantees the inverse property under specific conditions:
     * hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x when sum(x) == 0
   - There is NO guarantee for ihilbert(hilbert(x)) == x

4. NYQUIST FREQUENCY HANDLING:

   - The documentation explicitly states: "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero"
   - This is a documented behavior, not an undocumented bug
   - This zeroing causes information loss by design

5. TERMINOLOGY ANALYSIS:

   - The term "inverse Hilbert transform" in ihilbert's description could be misleading
   - It suggests a general inverse relationship that doesn't actually exist
   - The functions are more accurately "conjugate" operations rather than true inverses

6. COMPARISON WITH STANDARD DEFINITIONS:

   - The documentation notes these functions differ from scipy.signal.hilbert
   - The sign convention differs from standard mathematical definitions
   - These are specialized functions for periodic sequences, not general Hilbert transforms

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does NOT promise that ihilbert and hilbert are perfect inverses of each other.
It only guarantees a specific round-trip property (hilbert(ihilbert(x))) under the condition that
sum(x) == 0. The zeroing of the Nyquist frequency for even-length arrays is explicitly documented.

The bug report's claim that these should be "true inverses" is based on an assumption not supported
by the documentation. However, the documentation could be clearer about the limitations of the
inverse relationship.
