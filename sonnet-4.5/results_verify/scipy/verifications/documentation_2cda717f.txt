## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

1. **scipy.datasets module documentation**:
   - States that the module "depends on Pooch" for handling data fetching
   - Does not explicitly state that pooch is an optional dependency
   - Describes download_all() as a utility method to download all dataset files

2. **download_all() function documentation**:
   - Parameter `path`: "If None, default to the system cache_dir detected by pooch"
   - No mention of what happens when pooch is not available
   - Examples show simple usage: `datasets.download_all()` and `datasets.download_all(".")`

3. **Script usage documentation** (from file header):
   - States: "Platform independent script to download all the scipy.datasets module data files"
   - Usage: "python _download_all.py <download_dir>"
   - Command line help shows path is optional: "Directory path to download all the data files"

### Code Implementation Details

1. **Consistent error handling pattern**:
   - The codebase consistently uses the same ImportError message across multiple files:
     "Missing optional dependency 'pooch' required for scipy.datasets module. Please use pip or conda to install 'pooch'."
   - This message appears in _utils.py, _fetchers.py, _download_all.py, and tests

2. **Pooch is treated as optional**:
   - The code explicitly handles ImportError for pooch (lines 10-13)
   - Sets pooch = None when not available
   - download_all() function checks if pooch is None and raises a clear ImportError

### Documentation vs Implementation Gap

The documentation does not explicitly state:
1. That pooch is an optional dependency (though the code treats it as such)
2. What error message users should expect when pooch is missing
3. That the script form requires pooch to be installed even for help/usage

### Conclusion

The implementation clearly intends for pooch to be an optional dependency with graceful error handling. The bug prevents this intended behavior from working correctly when the module is run as a script. The documentation could be clearer about pooch being optional, but the code's consistent error handling pattern shows clear intent for how missing pooch should be handled.
