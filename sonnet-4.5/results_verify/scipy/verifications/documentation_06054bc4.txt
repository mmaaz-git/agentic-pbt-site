## Documentation Analysis for NominalAttribute Empty Values

### Official ARFF Specification
The official ARFF format documentation from Weka (the original source of the ARFF format) does not explicitly specify whether nominal attributes can have empty value lists. The documentation shows examples like:
```
@ATTRIBUTE class {Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor,Iris-virginica}
```
But does not state a minimum number of required values.

### Scipy Documentation
The scipy documentation for `loadarff()` provides examples of nominal attributes with multiple values but does not address whether empty nominal attributes are valid or invalid.

### Code Intent Analysis
Looking at the scipy implementation:

1. **Regex Pattern**: The code uses `r_nominal = re.compile(r'{(.+)}')` which requires at least one character inside braces. This suggests empty nominal attributes `{}` were intentionally excluded from parsing.

2. **Documentation in Code**: The docstring for `_get_nom_val()` states: "A nominal type is defined as something framed between braces ({})" but doesn't mention whether empty braces are valid.

3. **Parser Behavior**: The parser explicitly rejects `{}` with "This does not look like a nominal string" error before even reaching the NominalAttribute constructor.

### Semantic Interpretation
From a semantic perspective, a nominal attribute represents a categorical variable with a finite set of possible values. An empty set of values would mean:
- No valid values are possible for this attribute
- Every data instance would need to have a missing value (?) for this attribute
- The attribute provides no information and serves no purpose

### Conclusion on Documentation
The documentation is **ambiguous** about empty nominal attributes:
- No explicit statement that they are invalid
- No explicit statement that they are valid
- The regex pattern and parser behavior suggest they were considered invalid
- Semantically, an empty nominal attribute doesn't make practical sense

The fact that the parser rejects `{}` before reaching NominalAttribute.__init__ suggests the developers considered empty nominal attributes invalid at the format level. However, the NominalAttribute class itself doesn't validate this assumption, leading to the crash when instantiated directly with empty values.
