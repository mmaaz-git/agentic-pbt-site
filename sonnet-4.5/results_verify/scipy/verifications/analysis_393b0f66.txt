## Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID**:
- One could argue that the combinations [0,1] and [0,2] don't make semantic sense - why would you want stdout output but no file output when you could just not specify a rptfile?

**Why it's NOT INVALID**:
- The documentation explicitly states init can be 0 and so_init can be 1 or 2
- There's no documented restriction on these combinations
- The error is an implementation detail (missing lookup table entries), not a validation error
- The combinations are semantically meaningful - user might want console output during development without creating files

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX**:
- These combinations might be considered obscure edge cases
- Users can work around by using init=1 with so_init=1 to get stdout output

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX**:
- The crash is not an obscure error - it's a direct result of documented parameter values
- This is not an extreme edge case but a straightforward combination of documented options
- The fix is trivial (add 2 entries to lookup table)

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX**:
- The code might have intentionally excluded these combinations
- Documentation could be updated to specify which combinations are valid

**Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX**:
- The combinations make logical sense (no file output, but console output)
- The code allows these values to be set (lines 1062-1065) but then crashes on lookup
- It appears to be an oversight in the lookup table, not an intentional restriction

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST**:
- Supporting [0,1] and [0,2] could be seen as adding new functionality

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST**:
- The documentation already says these values are valid
- The code already tries to support them (sets the values in iprint_l)
- It only fails at the lookup stage, suggesting incomplete implementation rather than missing feature

### Considering BUG
**Why it IS a BUG**:
1. Documentation states init=0 and so_init=1/2 are valid inputs
2. The method accepts these inputs without validation errors
3. The method builds the internal representation correctly
4. It crashes only because of missing lookup table entries
5. The crash is unexpected given the documented interface
6. The fix is straightforward (add missing combinations to ip2arg)
7. The missing combinations are logically valid (no file output, stdout output only)

This is clearly a bug where the implementation's lookup table is incomplete compared to the documented and logical parameter space.
