## Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The function accepts `step_factor=0` in validation but fails with division by zero during computation
2. This produces runtime warnings and returns NaN results instead of a clean error
3. The mathematical operations require `step_factor > 0` but validation only checks `>= 0`
4. Users get confusing behavior (warnings and NaN) instead of a clear error message
5. The fix is straightforward - change validation from `>= 0` to `> 0`

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug in the validation logic.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug report correctly identifies a real issue.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code does fail with `step_factor=0` as reported
2. The validation is indeed checking `>= 0` when it should check `> 0`
3. Division by zero occurs exactly where the report claims

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR:**
1. `step_factor=0` is an obscure edge case that likely won't occur in practice
2. The function still returns a result (albeit with NaN) and doesn't crash

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not just a theoretical edge case - it's a validation bug that produces confusing errors
2. The fix is trivial and improves user experience
3. Proper input validation is important for a scientific computing library

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The documentation doesn't explicitly state `step_factor` must be positive
2. The error message says "non-negative" when it should say "positive"
3. Could argue this is just a documentation issue

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The code has a clear bug - it accepts invalid input and fails during computation
2. This is primarily a code issue, not just documentation
3. Even if docs were updated, the code would still fail with division by zero

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function already exists and should work correctly
2. This is fixing a bug, not adding a feature
3. Proper validation is expected behavior, not a new feature

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The validation logic incorrectly allows `step_factor=0` which causes division by zero during computation. The function should reject this value upfront with a clear error message. The bug report:

1. Correctly identifies the issue
2. Provides accurate reproduction steps
3. Points to the exact lines of code causing the problem
4. Suggests an appropriate fix

The mathematical algorithm requires `step_factor > 0` to function correctly, but the validation only checks for `>= 0`. This mismatch between validation and requirements is a textbook validation bug that should be fixed.
