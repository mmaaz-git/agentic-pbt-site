## Documentation Analysis

### Official scipy.spatial.distance.dice Documentation
The official documentation describes the Dice dissimilarity metric with the formula:
- Dice dissimilarity = (c_TF + c_FT) / (2*c_TT + c_FT + c_TF)
- The documentation does NOT mention what happens when both inputs are all False (zeros)
- The documentation does NOT specify any edge cases or preconditions
- The examples shown only demonstrate cases with at least some True values

### Mathematical Definition of Dice Coefficient
From external sources on Dice coefficient:
- The Dice coefficient is widely used in image segmentation and similarity measurement
- When both sets are empty (all zeros), different implementations handle this differently:
  - Some implementations add a small constant (e.g., +1) to avoid division by zero
  - Some define it as 1 (perfect similarity) by convention when both sets are empty
  - The mathematical formula itself produces 0/0 which is undefined

### Comparison with scipy.spatial.distance.jaccard
The jaccard function in scipy explicitly handles the all-zeros case:
- Documentation states: "If u and v are both zero, their Jaccard dissimilarity is defined to be zero."
- Source code confirms: returns 0.0 when denominator is 0
- Version 1.2.0 changelog: "Previously, if all (positively weighted) elements in u and v are zero, the function would return nan. This was changed to return 0 instead."
- This establishes precedent within scipy for handling this edge case

### Key Findings
1. The dice function documentation does NOT specify behavior for all-False inputs
2. The jaccard function (a similar dissimilarity metric) explicitly returns 0.0 for this case
3. Returning 0.0 for identical inputs (even if all False) is consistent with distance metric properties
4. The current NaN behavior is undocumented and unexpected
5. scipy has precedent (jaccard v1.2.0) for fixing this exact type of edge case

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify what should happen when both arrays are all False, making this technically undefined behavior. However, given:
- The precedent set by jaccard in the same module
- The mathematical expectation that identical inputs have zero distance
- The lack of any warning in the documentation about this edge case
This appears to be a legitimate bug rather than intentional behavior.
