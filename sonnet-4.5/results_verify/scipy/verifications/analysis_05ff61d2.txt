Triage Analysis
===============

Evaluating this bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect)
   Arguments against:
   - The documentation clearly states digit-prefixed keys should not be saved
   - The test cases demonstrate the documented behavior is not followed
   - The code inconsistency between struct fields and top-level keys is evident

   Arguments for:
   - None. The bug report is accurate and well-documented.

   Verdict: NOT INVALID

2. WONTFIX (Bug is trivial/uninteresting)
   Arguments for:
   - Could be considered an edge case (who uses digit-prefixed variable names?)
   - Has existed for a while without major complaints

   Arguments against:
   - Creates inconsistent behavior between struct fields and top-level keys
   - Violates explicit documentation contract
   - Could cause silent data corruption (users expect keys to be dropped but they're saved)
   - MATLAB compatibility issue (MATLAB doesn't allow such variable names)
   - The fix is trivial (one-line change)

   Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - This is a legitimate consistency and correctness issue

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Requesting unsupported functionality)
   Arguments for:
   - None. The documentation already claims this is supported.

   Arguments against:
   - The documentation explicitly says this behavior should already exist
   - This is not asking for new functionality but fixing existing broken functionality

   Verdict: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
   Arguments for:
   - Could change documentation to match current behavior

   Arguments against:
   - The documented behavior is the correct one (follows MATLAB conventions)
   - Struct fields already follow the documented behavior
   - Changing docs would create inconsistency between field levels
   - The implementation is clearly wrong, not the documentation
   - MATLAB itself doesn't allow digit-prefixed variable names

   Verdict: NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The docs are correct; the code is wrong

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments for:
   - Clear violation of documented behavior
   - Inconsistency between top-level and struct field handling
   - Violates MATLAB variable naming conventions
   - Could cause silent data issues (keys saved when user expects them dropped)
   - Simple fix available (already identified in bug report)
   - The code at line 486 shows the correct implementation for struct fields
   - Line 884 is missing the digit check that line 486 has

   Arguments against:
   - None. This is a clear implementation bug.

   Verdict: THIS IS A BUG

Final Assessment:
-----------------
This is a valid BUG. The implementation fails to match the documented behavior for
top-level dictionary keys starting with digits. The code correctly handles this case
for struct fields but not for top-level keys, creating an inconsistency. The fix is
straightforward and the bug report correctly identifies both the problem and solution.
