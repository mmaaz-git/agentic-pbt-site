## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation for scipy.optimize.bisect does not specify that the function should return the same root when interval endpoints are swapped. The parameters are described as "one end" and "the other end" of the bracketing interval, suggesting they are interchangeable endpoints, but this only means both orderings are valid inputs, not that they must produce identical outputs. When multiple roots exist within an interval, there is no documented requirement for deterministic root selection based on interval direction. The function only promises to find "a root" where the function changes sign, and both -1.0 and 1.0 are valid roots of x³ - x = 0.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The phrasing "one end" and "the other end" could be interpreted as implying the endpoints are fully interchangeable in all respects, including output. The fact that other scipy optimization methods (brentq, brenth) do return consistent roots regardless of interval direction suggests there might be an implicit expectation of consistency across the scipy.optimize module.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case that only manifests when there are multiple roots in the interval and at specific floating-point boundaries. The bisection algorithm is working correctly - it finds a valid root in both cases. The difference in behavior is a natural consequence of how the bisection algorithm works with floating-point arithmetic and interval halving. Since both results are mathematically correct roots, and the primary use case of bisect is to find any root (not a specific root), this inconsistency may be deemed unimportant for practical purposes.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency could be surprising to users and makes the function non-deterministic in a way that might affect reproducibility of scientific computations. If other methods in the same module handle this case consistently, users might reasonably expect bisect to do the same. The fix appears straightforward (normalize interval direction), so the benefit-to-effort ratio might justify addressing it.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current documentation doesn't clarify the behavior when multiple roots exist or whether interval direction affects the output. Adding a note that "when multiple roots exist in the interval, the specific root found may depend on the order of the interval endpoints" would accurately describe the current behavior and set proper expectations. This would be the minimal change needed to ensure users understand the function's behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation already says it finds "a root" not "the root," which could be considered sufficient to imply that with multiple roots, any one might be returned. Additionally, documenting this as expected behavior might cement a quirk that could be seen as undesirable.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The request for consistent behavior regardless of interval direction could be seen as asking for a new feature - deterministic root selection. This would be an enhancement to make the function more predictable and user-friendly, especially for cases with multiple roots. Implementing interval normalization would be adding new behavior rather than fixing broken behavior, since the current implementation does find valid roots.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Users might reasonably expect mathematical functions to be deterministic for the same mathematical input (an interval is the same whether specified as [a,b] or [b,a]). The fact that other scipy methods already provide this consistency suggests it's more of a bug fix to bring bisect in line with module conventions rather than a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The inconsistent behavior between bisect and other scipy.optimize methods (brentq, brenth) suggests this might be an implementation oversight. Users reasonably expect deterministic behavior from numerical algorithms, and having the same interval produce different results based solely on endpoint order violates the principle of least surprise. The mathematical concept of an interval is order-independent, so the implementation should reflect this.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation never promises deterministic behavior with respect to interval direction. The function correctly finds a valid root in both cases, fulfilling its documented contract. The bisection algorithm's behavior is a natural consequence of its implementation, and different roots for different orderings could be considered an implementation detail rather than a bug. The algorithm is working as designed, even if the design leads to this quirk.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be an INVALID bug report. The scipy.optimize.bisect function is working correctly according to its documentation. The documentation promises to find "a root" of the function within the given interval where the function changes sign, and it successfully does this regardless of interval endpoint order. Both -1.0 and 1.0 are valid roots of x³ - x = 0 within the interval [-10, 8].

The documentation's description of parameters as "one end" and "the other end" of the interval merely indicates that both orderings are valid inputs, not that they must produce identical outputs. There is no documented requirement for deterministic root selection when multiple roots exist. While the inconsistency with other methods might be surprising, each algorithm has its own characteristics, and bisect is explicitly described as a "slow but sure" basic bisection routine.

The core issue is that the bug reporter is asserting an undocumented requirement - that interval direction shouldn't affect which root is found. While this might be a reasonable expectation from a user experience perspective, it's not a violation of the function's documented behavior. At most, this could warrant a documentation clarification, but the current behavior is mathematically correct and meets all documented requirements.
