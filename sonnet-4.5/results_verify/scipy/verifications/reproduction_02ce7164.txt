REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I successfully reproduced the reported behavior with the provided test cases.

TEST RESULTS:

1. TEST WITH initial_step=0:
   - Input: scipy.differentiate.derivative(f, x=1.0, initial_step=0)
   - Result: success=False, df=nan, status=-3
   - Expected by bug report: ValueError should be raised
   - Actual behavior: No error raised, returns failed result with NaN

2. TEST WITH initial_step=-0.5:
   - Input: scipy.differentiate.derivative(f, x=1.0, initial_step=-0.5)
   - Result: success=False, df=nan, status=-3
   - Expected by bug report: ValueError should be raised
   - Actual behavior: No error raised, returns failed result with NaN

3. TEST WITH initial_step=0.5 (valid):
   - Input: scipy.differentiate.derivative(f, x=1.0, initial_step=0.5)
   - Result: success=True, dfâ‰ˆ2.0, status=0
   - This works correctly as expected

HYPOTHESIS TESTS:
The hypothesis tests expect ValueError to be raised for zero and negative initial_step values, but this does not happen. Instead, the function returns a result with success=False and NaN values.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Looking at the source code (_differentiate.py line 408), the implementation handles non-positive initial_step values by converting them to NaN:
```python
h0 = xpx.at(h0)[h0 <= 0].set(xp.nan)
```

This causes the algorithm to encounter a non-finite value and fail with status=-3, but does NOT raise a ValueError during input validation.

COMPARISON WITH step_factor:
The bug report mentions that step_factor is validated (lines 27-33), but initial_step is not. This is correct - step_factor is included in the validation that checks for non-negative scalars, but initial_step is handled separately and not validated for positivity.

VERIFICATION:
The bug report's technical details are accurate:
1. The function does accept zero and negative initial_step values without raising an error
2. These values cause silent failures with success=False and df=nan
3. The status code is -3 (non-finite value encountered)
4. There is indeed no input validation for initial_step positivity
