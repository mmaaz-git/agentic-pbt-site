CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
========================

## Consideration for BUG

Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:
- The operation is mathematically valid (mean of 1 rotation = itself)
- Inconsistent behavior: sequence of 1 works, single doesn't
- Poor error message doesn't explain the actual limitation
- API inconsistency violates principle of least surprise
- The method exists on the object but crashes based on internal state

Arguments AGAINST:
- SciPy has an intentional design distinction between scalar and sequence rotations
- Similar behavior exists for len() (issue #13452) and was deemed intentional
- The documentation does mention "set of rotations" (plural)

## Consideration for INVALID

Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:
- The design philosophy treats scalar rotations differently by design
- GitHub issue #13452 shows this pattern is intentional for similar operations
- The error technically makes sense within SciPy's scalar vs sequence design

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state this limitation
- The mathematical operation is well-defined
- Users have reasonable expectations it should work

## Consideration for WONTFIX

Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:
- While annoying, users can work around it by using [angle] instead of angle
- The scalar/sequence distinction appears fundamental to the design
- Changing this might break backward compatibility

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not an obscure edge case - computing mean of rotations is common
- The workaround isn't obvious without understanding internal design

## Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The code behaves consistently with SciPy's scalar/sequence design philosophy
- The main issue is that users don't expect this limitation
- Documentation should explicitly state mean() only works on sequences
- Should document that single rotations need to be converted to sequences

Arguments AGAINST:
- The inconsistency itself (sequence of 1 works, single doesn't) is still problematic
- Even with documentation, the API remains confusing

## Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Adding support for mean() on single rotations would be a new capability
- The current behavior is intentional, not accidental
- This would enhance the API to be more user-friendly

Arguments AGAINST:
- The mathematical operation is already well-defined
- It works for sequences of 1, so the functionality exists
- This feels more like fixing an oversight than adding a feature

## Final Assessment

The strongest case is for DOCUMENTATION_FIX because:

1. SciPy has an established, intentional design pattern distinguishing scalar and sequence rotations
2. This pattern was confirmed as intentional in GitHub issue #13452 for len()
3. The mean() behavior is consistent with this design philosophy
4. The primary problem is that users don't expect this limitation
5. The documentation should explicitly state that mean() requires sequence rotations
6. The error message could be more informative

While the API is inconsistent and confusing, it appears to be intentionally so, making this primarily a documentation issue rather than a code bug.
