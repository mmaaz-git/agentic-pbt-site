## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Hypothesis Test Results
The provided Hypothesis test successfully reproduced the bug. When running the test with 2000 examples, it immediately found a failing case with delta=1e-308 and r=1.0, which returns NaN instead of a finite value.

### Manual Test Case Results
The manual test case from the bug report was confirmed:
- sp.pseudo_huber(1e-200, 1.0) returns NaN (confirmed)
- The expected value would be approximately 1.0 (since |r| - delta = 1.0 - 1e-200 â‰ˆ 1.0)

### Additional Testing
Further testing revealed a clear pattern:
- delta=1e-100: returns 1.000000000000011e-100 (finite, correct)
- delta=1e-150: returns 9.999999999999882e-151 (finite, correct)
- delta=1e-190: returns NaN (bug manifests)
- delta=1e-200: returns NaN (bug manifests)
- delta=1e-250: returns NaN (bug manifests)
- delta=1e-300: returns NaN (bug manifests)

The bug appears to manifest when delta is approximately less than 1e-190, confirming the bug report's claim.

### Bug Mechanism
The bug report's explanation of the numerical overflow mechanism is accurate:
1. When delta is very small (< ~1e-190) and r is non-zero
2. The computation (r/delta)^2 overflows to infinity
3. sqrt(infinity) = infinity
4. infinity - 1 = infinity
5. delta^2 * infinity = 0 * infinity = NaN

This is a clear numerical stability issue in the implementation that causes the function to return NaN for valid inputs where a finite value is mathematically expected.
