## Documentation Analysis for scipy.cluster.vq.whiten

### Official Documentation
The official scipy documentation for whiten states:
- Purpose: "Normalize a group of observations on a per feature basis" by rescaling each feature to have unit variance
- Method: Divides each feature column by its standard deviation
- Returns: A new ndarray with features scaled by the standard deviations

The online documentation DOES NOT mention:
- What happens when columns have zero standard deviation
- Any special handling for columns with all identical values
- Any warnings that might be raised

### Source Code Documentation and Implementation
Looking at the actual source code in vq.py (lines 140-147), I found:
1. The function checks for zero standard deviation using exact equality: `zero_std_mask = std_dev == 0`
2. When zero std is detected, it sets the std_dev to 1.0 to prevent division by zero
3. It raises a RuntimeWarning that states: "Some columns have standard deviation zero. The values of these columns will not change."

### Key Finding
The warning message in the source code explicitly promises: "The values of these columns will not change" for columns with zero standard deviation. This is a clear behavioral contract that the function establishes with users through its warning system.

### The Gap
The bug report correctly identifies that the function uses exact equality (`std_dev == 0`) to detect zero standard deviation columns. Due to floating-point precision issues, columns with all identical values can have a computed standard deviation that is extremely small (e.g., 8.88e-16) but not exactly zero. This causes:
1. The warning not to be triggered
2. The column to be divided by the near-zero value, producing astronomical results
3. A violation of the documented behavior promised in the warning message
