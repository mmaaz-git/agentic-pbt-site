## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Both the Hypothesis test and manual reproduction code confirm the issue.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test fails exactly as described with the input `{'A': []}`. The test expects that after saving and loading, an empty 1D array should maintain dimensional consistency, but instead:
- Original shape: (0,) [1D empty array]
- Loaded shape: (0, 0) [2D empty array]

This causes an assertion error when comparing arrays because the dimensions don't match.

### Manual Reproduction Results
The manual tests confirm the specific issue with the `oned_as` parameter:

1. **Empty arrays with oned_as='row'**:
   - Input: shape (0,)
   - Expected output: shape (1, 0) [row vector]
   - Actual output: shape (0, 0) [incorrect]

2. **Empty arrays with oned_as='column'**:
   - Input: shape (0,)
   - Expected output: shape (0, 1) [column vector]
   - Actual output: shape (0, 0) [incorrect]

3. **Non-empty arrays with oned_as='row'**:
   - Input: shape (3,)
   - Expected output: shape (1, 3) [row vector]
   - Actual output: shape (1, 3) [correct âœ“]

### Key Findings
The bug is real and affects only empty 1D arrays. The `oned_as` parameter is completely ignored for empty arrays, always resulting in a (0, 0) shape regardless of the setting.

Interestingly, when explicitly creating 2D empty arrays with the correct shapes and saving them:
- (1, 0) arrays are preserved correctly as (1, 0)
- (0, 1) arrays are preserved correctly as (0, 1)

This shows that the MATLAB format can handle these shapes correctly; the issue is specifically in the conversion logic for 1D empty arrays when using the `oned_as` parameter.
