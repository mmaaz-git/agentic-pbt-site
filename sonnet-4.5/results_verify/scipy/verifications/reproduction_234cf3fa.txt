## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Reproduction Status
The reported bug has been successfully reproduced. The issue occurs exactly as described in the bug report.

### Test Results

#### Property-Based Test
The hypothesis test fails as reported:
- Input: `1.1754943508222875e-38`
- Result: `0.0`
- Expected: `1.1754943508222875e-38`
- The assertion `math.isclose(result, temp, rel_tol=1e-10)` fails

#### Specific Examples
1. For `temp = 1e-10`:
   - Input: `1e-10`
   - Result: `9.998757e-11`
   - Relative error: ~0.0124%
   - Precision is lost but value is non-zero

2. For `temp = 1e-20`:
   - Input: `1e-20`
   - Result: `0.0`
   - Complete loss of data (100% error)

#### Scale-Specific Behavior
Testing identity conversions for all temperature scales with input `1e-20`:
- **Celsius → Celsius**: Returns `0.0` (PRECISION LOST)
- **Kelvin → Kelvin**: Returns `1e-20` (CORRECT)
- **Fahrenheit → Fahrenheit**: Returns `1.066e-14` (PRECISION LOST)
- **Rankine → Rankine**: Returns `1e-20` (CORRECT)

### Root Cause Analysis
The precision loss occurs due to the two-step conversion process through Kelvin:

1. **Celsius identity conversion**:
   - Step 1: `tempo = 1e-20 + 273.15 = 273.15` (small value lost in addition)
   - Step 2: `res = 273.15 - 273.15 = 0.0` (catastrophic cancellation)

2. **Floating-point limits**:
   - The value `1e-20` requires ~66 bits below the decimal point
   - When added to 273.15, the mantissa cannot represent both values
   - Double precision floats have only 53 bits of precision
   - Values smaller than ~1e-15 get completely lost when added to 273.15

### Technical Correctness
The bug report accurately describes:
1. The mechanism of precision loss (catastrophic cancellation)
2. The threshold where complete data loss occurs (~1e-20)
3. The mathematical violation of the identity property `f(x, A, A) = x`
4. The fact that this is caused by unnecessary intermediate conversion

The proposed fix (early return for identity conversions) would completely solve the issue.
