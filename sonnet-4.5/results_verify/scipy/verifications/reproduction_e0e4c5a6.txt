REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed and behaves exactly as described.

HYPOTHESIS TEST:
- The provided Hypothesis test fails as expected
- Falsifying example: array([[1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1.]])
- The test correctly identifies that 4x 90-degree rotations with reshape=False do not return the original array

MANUAL REPRODUCTION:
The manual reproduction code confirms the bug with detailed analysis:

1. Original 2x3 array: [[1. 1. 1.], [1. 1. 1.]]
2. After 4x 90° rotations with reshape=False: [[0. 0.125 0.], [0. 0.125 0.]]
3. Data degrades exponentially: 1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25 → 0.125 → (further degradation)

COMPARISON TESTS CONFIRM:
- Single 360° rotation works correctly: Returns original array ✓
- 4x 90° rotations with reshape=True: Returns original array ✓
- 4x 90° rotations on square arrays with reshape=False: Returns original array ✓
- 4x 90° rotations on non-square arrays with reshape=False: FAILS ✗

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The bug occurs because when reshape=False is used with non-square arrays:
1. A 90° rotation of a 2x3 array should naturally produce a 3x2 array
2. With reshape=False, the output is forced to maintain the original 2x3 shape
3. This causes the rotated content to be cropped/interpolated to fit
4. Each subsequent rotation compounds this data loss
5. After 4 rotations, most of the data is lost (values become 0 or severely degraded)

The behavior is consistent and reproducible across different non-square array shapes and values.
