TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## BUG - Why this might be a valid bug:
1. The function crashes with an unintended TypeError instead of raising the expected ValueError
2. The crash is due to a clear programming error: using `*tol` (unpacking operator) on a float value
3. The function works correctly when name is provided but fails when name=None, showing inconsistent behavior
4. All other error paths in the function correctly raise ValueError, this is the only path that crashes
5. The error message formatting is clearly wrong - it tries to fill two placeholders `{}` and `{:5.5f}` but only provides one value via incorrect unpacking
6. The proposed fix is trivial and correct - removing the asterisk and properly formatting the string

## INVALID - Why this might be invalid:
NO STRONG REASONS. The bug is clearly valid. The only weak argument could be that name=None is an edge case, but the function explicitly supports it as an optional parameter.

## WONTFIX - Why this might be wontfix:
1. Could be considered low severity since it only affects the case where name=None
2. Users can work around it by always providing a name parameter
3. The function still fails (just with wrong exception type) so invalid matrices are still rejected

However, these are weak reasons - the bug prevents proper error handling and breaks the function's contract.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why this might be a documentation issue:
NOT APPLICABLE. The documentation doesn't specify that name=None would cause different behavior. The code is clearly wrong, not the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST - Why this might be a feature request:
NOT APPLICABLE. This is not requesting new functionality but fixing broken existing functionality.

## CONCLUSION:
This is clearly a BUG. The code contains an obvious programming error (incorrect use of the unpacking operator) that causes the function to crash with TypeError instead of raising the intended ValueError. The error occurs on a specific code path (when name=None and diagonal is non-zero within tolerance), and the fix is straightforward and correct. The function should behave consistently regardless of whether name is provided or not.
