DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

Documentation Sources Reviewed:
1. scipy.optimize.bisect documentation
2. scipy.optimize.RootResults documentation
3. scipy.optimize tutorial on root-finding

Key Documentation Findings:

1. RootResults.function_calls Field:
   - Documented as: "Number of times the function was called"
   - Type: integer
   - No additional specificity about what evaluations to include/exclude

2. Bracketing Methods Documentation:
   - bisect, ridder, brenth, brentq are bracketing methods requiring f(a)*f(b) < 0
   - No explicit statement about whether initial bracket verification calls count
   - No documentation specifies that initial evaluations should be excluded

3. Documentation Ambiguity:
   - The phrase "Number of times the function was called" is general
   - Could reasonably be interpreted as ALL function calls during the operation
   - No documentation suggests initial bracket checks should be excluded

4. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:
   - Since the methods MUST evaluate f(a) and f(b) to verify the bracketing condition
   - These are function calls made "during" the root-finding process
   - The natural interpretation is that ALL calls should be counted

5. Documentation Completeness:
   - The documentation does not explicitly address this edge case
   - However, the current implementation (counting all calls) aligns with the
     most straightforward interpretation of "Number of times the function was called"

Conclusion:
The documentation supports the current implementation where ALL function evaluations
are counted, including the initial bracket verification calls. The bug report's
expectation that these should be excluded is not supported by any documentation.
