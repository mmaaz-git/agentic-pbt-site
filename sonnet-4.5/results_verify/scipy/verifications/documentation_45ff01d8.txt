## Documentation Analysis for scipy.integrate.tanhsinh

### Official Documentation Review

The scipy.integrate.tanhsinh function documentation states:

1. **Purpose**: "Numerically evaluate convergent integrals using tanh-sinh quadrature"
2. **Function signature**: Takes a callable `f` that should be an "elementwise function"
3. **Requirements on integrand**:
   - Must be a callable that accepts real number inputs
   - Should be a convergent integral
   - Can handle endpoints with singularities
   - Cannot handle divergent integrals or singularities within the interval

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Elementwise function requirement**: The documentation specifically states that `f` must be an "elementwise function". This is crucial - it implies the function should handle array inputs and return arrays of the same shape.

2. **No explicit mention of scalar returns**: The documentation does not explicitly state that the function must NOT return scalars, nor does it warn that scalar returns will cause errors.

3. **preserve_shape parameter**: There is a `preserve_shape` parameter (default False) that "controls how function arguments are handled", but the documentation doesn't clearly explain that this might affect scalar vs array returns.

4. **Examples in documentation**: The examples provided in the documentation all use functions that naturally work element-wise (like np.exp), but there's no example showing a constant function.

### What the Documentation Does NOT Say

1. The documentation does not explicitly warn that constant functions (which naturally return scalars) will fail.
2. It does not specify that the function MUST return an array with the same shape as its input.
3. It does not provide guidance on how to properly implement a constant function for integration.
4. The term "elementwise function" is used but not clearly defined in terms of its exact requirements.

### Analysis

The requirement that `f` be an "elementwise function" suggests it should work like numpy ufuncs - accepting arrays and returning arrays of the same shape. However, this is not explicitly stated, and Python functions that return constants are perfectly valid mathematical functions that should be integrable.

A constant function like `f(x) = c` is one of the most basic integrable functions in mathematics, with integral `c * (b - a)`. The fact that such functions cause the integrator to crash suggests either:
1. A bug in the implementation
2. An undocumented restriction that needs to be clarified in the documentation
