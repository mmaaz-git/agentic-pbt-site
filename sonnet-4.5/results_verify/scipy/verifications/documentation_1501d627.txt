DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FUNCTION DOCSTRING:
   The docstring for scipy.optimize.cython_optimize._zeros.full_output_example states:

   Returns
   -------
   full_output : dict
       the root, number of function calls, number of iterations, and the zero
       function error number

   ISSUE: The docstring mentions "error number" but does NOT specify:
   - What values error_num can take
   - What these values mean
   - Whether they can be negative

2. SCIPY ONLINE DOCUMENTATION:
   According to the official scipy documentation at docs.scipy.org:

   "An error number of -1 means a sign error, -2 means a convergence error,
   and 0 means the solver converged."

   This CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that:
   - error_num = 0: Success/convergence
   - error_num = -1: Sign error
   - error_num = -2: Convergence error

   The negative values are EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED in the official documentation.

3. COMPARISON WITH STANDARD SCIPY API:
   The standard scipy.optimize functions (like brentq) handle errors differently:
   - They raise exceptions (RuntimeError) on convergence failure
   - They don't return error codes

   The Cython API intentionally uses a different error handling approach with
   error codes instead of exceptions, likely for performance reasons in Cython/C contexts.

4. API CONTRACT ANALYSIS:
   The bug report claims "Error codes in most APIs are non-negative integers by convention."

   However:
   - The scipy documentation explicitly documents negative error codes
   - Many C APIs use negative error codes (e.g., POSIX errno values)
   - The behavior matches the documented specification

CONCLUSION:
The function behaves EXACTLY as documented in the official scipy documentation.
The negative error codes are intentional and documented. The local docstring could
be improved to include this information, but the behavior is not a bug.
