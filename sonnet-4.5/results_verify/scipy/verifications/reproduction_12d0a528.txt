## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Setup:
I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report using the scipy.datasets._utils._clear_cache function.

### Reproduction Results:

1. **Without -O flag (normal mode)**:
   - When passing a non-callable string to _clear_cache
   - Result: AssertionError is raised (as expected)
   - The assert statement on line 36 catches the invalid input

2. **With -O flag (optimization mode)**:
   - When passing the same non-callable string
   - Result: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '__name__'
   - The assert is bypassed, causing line 37 to fail when accessing dataset.__name__

### Technical Verification:
1. The bug report's code examples are accurate and run correctly
2. The behavior changes between normal and optimized Python execution
3. The assert statement on line 36 (`assert callable(dataset)`) is indeed bypassed with -O
4. This leads to a less informative error message downstream

### Key Finding:
The bug report is technically accurate:
- Assert statements ARE disabled with Python's -O flag
- This DOES cause different behavior and error messages
- The error in optimized mode (AttributeError) is less clear than the validation error

### Behavior Consistency:
The function's behavior is inconsistent depending on Python's optimization level:
- Normal mode: Early validation with AssertionError
- Optimized mode: Late failure with AttributeError

This confirms that the assert statement is being used for input validation, which can be bypassed, leading to inconsistent API behavior and confusing error messages.
