REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

1. TEST EXECUTION:
I ran both the simple reproduction script and the property-based test. The results confirm the reported behavior.

2. OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:

Test Case 1: Invalid dataset with non-existent cache directory
- Input: _clear_cache(invalid_dataset, cache_dir="/path/that/doesnt/exist")
- Output: Prints "Cache Directory ... doesn't exist. Nothing to clear." and returns
- No ValueError raised

Test Case 2: Invalid dataset with existing cache directory
- Input: _clear_cache(invalid_dataset, cache_dir="/path/that/exists")
- Output: ValueError raised with message "Dataset method invalid_dataset doesn't exist..."

3. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
The code flow in _utils.py shows:
- Lines 24-26: Early return if cache_dir doesn't exist (before any validation)
- Lines 36-42: Validation of dataset methods (only executed if cache_dir exists)

This creates an inconsistency where:
- When cache_dir doesn't exist: No validation occurs, function silently returns
- When cache_dir exists: Full validation occurs, ValueError raised for invalid datasets

4. PROPERTY-BASED TEST RESULTS:
The hypothesis test with 10 random invalid dataset names confirms:
- All invalid names fail to raise ValueError when cache doesn't exist
- All invalid names correctly raise ValueError when cache exists
- This behavior is consistent across various input types (numeric, special chars, normal text)

5. ROOT CAUSE:
The early return at line 24-26 bypasses all subsequent validation logic. The check for cache directory existence happens before dataset validation, creating a path where invalid inputs are never validated.

CONCLUSION:
The bug report accurately describes the behavior. The function does indeed bypass input validation when the cache directory doesn't exist, creating inconsistent behavior based on filesystem state rather than input validity.
