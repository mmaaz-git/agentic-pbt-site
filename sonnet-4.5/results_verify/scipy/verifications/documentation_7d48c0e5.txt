## Documentation Analysis for scipy.fft.dct

### Official SciPy Documentation
From the official scipy.fft.dct documentation (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fft.dct.html), I found:

1. **Explicit Requirement Stated**: The documentation clearly states "Type 1 DCT requires input size > 1"
   - This is documented in the Notes section of the function
   - This requirement is specific to Type 1 DCT only

2. **Mathematical Definition**
From Wikipedia and mathematical references:
- DCT-I is mathematically defined as:
  X_k = (1/2)(x_0 + (-1)^k * x_(N-1)) + ∑(n=1 to N-2) x_n * cos[(π / (N-1)) * n * k]
- The formula explicitly involves division by (N-1) in the cosine term
- DCT-I is "not defined for N less than 2" according to mathematical literature
- The formula requires accessing both x_0 and x_(N-1), which means at least 2 elements are needed

3. **Comparison with Other DCT Types**
- DCT Types 2, 3, and 4 do NOT have this minimum size requirement
- Their mathematical definitions work correctly for N=1
- This is consistent with the observed behavior where types 2-4 work with single-element arrays

### Key Finding
The documentation DOES mention the requirement that DCT Type 1 requires input size > 1. However:
1. The error message "zero-length FFT requested" is misleading when the input has length 1
2. The error occurs at runtime rather than providing a clear validation error
3. The error message doesn't guide users to understand that DCT Type 1 requires at least 2 points

### Conclusion
The behavior is documented, but the error handling is poor. The misleading error message "zero-length FFT requested" for a length-1 array is confusing and doesn't help users understand the actual constraint.
