Bug Reproduction Results

BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
The bug report claims that scipy.constants.precision() returns negative values for physical constants with negative values, such as 'electron magn. moment'.

REPRODUCTION RESULTS:
1. The bug is CONFIRMED - the function does return negative values for constants with negative values.

2. Specific test case from bug report:
   - Key: 'electron magn. moment'
   - Value: -9.28476412e-24 (negative)
   - Absolute precision: 8e-31 (positive)
   - precision() returned: -8.61626627947119e-08 (negative)
   - Expected per bug report: 8.61626627947119e-08 (positive)

   The output exactly matches what the bug report claims.

3. Extended testing found 56+ physical constants with negative values that all produce negative precision values, including:
   - All magnetic moment related constants (electron, neutron, muon, helion, etc.)
   - Magnetic moment ratios
   - Sackur-Tetrode constants
   - Electron charge to mass quotient

4. For positive-valued constants (e.g., 'proton mass'), the precision is correctly positive.

5. The hypothesis test confirmed that for ALL negative-valued constants tested:
   - The returned precision value has the correct magnitude
   - The only issue is the sign - it's negative when it should be positive
   - The relationship is: actual_result = -expected_result when value < 0

MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION:
The current implementation: precision = uncertainty / value
- When value < 0 and uncertainty > 0, this gives a negative result
- The bug report's proposed fix (using abs()) would make the result positive

TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
The bug report's technical claims are 100% accurate:
- The reproduction code runs correctly
- The outputs match exactly what was claimed
- The issue affects all negative-valued constants consistently
- The proposed fix (adding abs()) would resolve the issue
