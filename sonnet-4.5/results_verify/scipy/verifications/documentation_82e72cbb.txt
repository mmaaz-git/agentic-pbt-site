DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have reviewed the scipy.stats.entropy documentation and related mathematical literature to understand what the expected behavior should be.

Official Documentation:
-----------------------
1. scipy.stats.entropy documentation states:
   - When qk is provided, it computes relative entropy: D = sum(pk * log(pk / qk))
   - This quantity is "also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence"
   - The function normalizes pk and qk if they don't sum to 1

2. scipy.special.rel_entr (the underlying function) documentation states:
   - rel_entr(x, y) = x * log(x/y) when x > 0, y > 0
   - Returns 0 when x = 0, y >= 0
   - Returns infinity otherwise
   - The function is "jointly convex in x and y"

Mathematical Literature:
------------------------
1. Kullback-Leibler divergence has well-established mathematical properties:
   - ALWAYS NON-NEGATIVE: D_KL(P||Q) ≥ 0 (Gibbs' inequality)
   - Equals zero if and only if P = Q almost everywhere
   - This is a fundamental property proven through Jensen's inequality

2. Multiple authoritative sources confirm non-negativity:
   - Wikipedia: "Relative entropy is always non-negative, D_KL(P||Q) ≥ 0, a result known as Gibbs' inequality"
   - Statistical textbooks uniformly state KL divergence is non-negative
   - Mathematical proofs exist showing this property must hold

Documentation Gaps:
-------------------
1. The scipy documentation does NOT explicitly state that KL divergence should be non-negative
2. The documentation does NOT mention any numerical precision limitations
3. There are NO warnings about potential negative results with extreme values
4. The documentation does NOT specify behavior with denormalized floating-point numbers

Key Finding:
------------
While the scipy documentation doesn't explicitly state that KL divergence must be non-negative, this is a fundamental mathematical property that is universally true. The fact that the function can return negative values is a violation of the mathematical definition, not just a documentation issue.

The documentation describes what the function INTENDS to compute (KL divergence), and KL divergence by mathematical definition must be non-negative. Therefore, returning negative values is incorrect behavior regardless of whether the documentation explicitly states this constraint.
