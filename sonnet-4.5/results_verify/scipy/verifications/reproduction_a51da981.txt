# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The scipy.stats.bartlett function does indeed return NaN for the p-value when all input samples have identical variances.

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Minimal Example Reproduction
Using the exact code from the bug report:
```python
samples = [
    np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 64.0]),
    np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 64.0]),
    np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 64.0])
]
statistic, p = scipy.stats.bartlett(*samples)
```

**Results:**
- Statistic: 0.0
- P-value: nan
- All three samples have identical variance: 674.4

### 2. Hypothesis Test
The provided hypothesis test would fail on the specific input case because it checks that p-values should be in the range [0, 1], but the function returns NaN which violates this constraint.

### 3. Chi-squared Distribution Verification
I verified the claim about chi2.sf(0, df=2):
- chi2.sf(0, df=2) returns 1.0 (as claimed)
- This is the mathematically correct value for the survival function at 0
- The survival function at 0 should always be 1.0 for any degrees of freedom

## Bug Confirmation
The bug is CONFIRMED. When the Bartlett test statistic is exactly 0.0 (which occurs when all samples have identical variances), the function returns NaN for the p-value instead of the correct value of 1.0.

## Impact
This is a real bug that occurs in a valid use case:
- When testing samples that have identical variances (a perfectly valid scenario)
- The test statistic correctly computes to 0.0
- But the p-value incorrectly returns NaN instead of 1.0
- This breaks downstream code that expects valid p-values in [0, 1]
