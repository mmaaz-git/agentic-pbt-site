## Triage Analysis for RotationSpline Bug Report

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why this could be a BUG:**
- The spline fails to pass through control points, violating the fundamental interpolation property
- Scipy's own test suite explicitly tests this property: `assert_allclose(spline(times).as_euler('xyz', degrees=True), angles)`
- The failure is reproducible (56/100 random seeds fail with the specific time pattern)
- The error magnitudes are significant (up to 1.4 in quaternion distance)
- No documentation warns about limitations with non-uniform time spacing
- The API accepts the problematic input without any warnings or errors

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- (No strong arguments against - this appears to be a clear bug)

### INVALID
**Why this could be INVALID:**
- (Not applicable - the bug is real and reproducible)

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The test case is valid and uses the API correctly
- The expectation (passing through control points) is mathematically sound
- Scipy's own tests verify this exact property

### WONTFIX
**Why this could be WONTFIX:**
- The issue only occurs with extreme time spacing ratios (0.015625 vs 1.0)
- Such extreme non-uniform spacing might be considered pathological
- Numerical stability issues with extreme inputs could be considered expected

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The API doesn't document any restrictions on time spacing
- The failure rate is high (56%) even for this edge case
- The errors are very large (not just numerical precision issues)
- Interpolation through control points is fundamental, not optional

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why this could be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could warn about numerical instability with non-uniform spacing
- Could document that extreme time ratios may cause issues
- Could specify recommended time spacing patterns

**Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code is actually broken, not just poorly documented
- Scipy's tests expect the behavior to work
- Adding warnings doesn't fix the underlying numerical instability

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why this could be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be requesting better numerical stability as a new feature
- Handling extreme time spacings could be seen as an enhancement

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is existing functionality that's broken
- Interpolation through control points isn't a new feature
- The API already accepts these inputs without error

### CONCLUSION

This is clearly a **BUG**. The RotationSpline class fails to satisfy the fundamental mathematical property of interpolation - passing through control points. This property is:

1. Mathematically required for any interpolation method
2. Explicitly tested in scipy's own test suite
3. Not documented as having any restrictions
4. Violated in a reproducible way with certain input patterns

The numerical instability with non-uniform time spacing represents a real bug in the implementation that should be fixed, either by:
- Improving the numerical stability of the algorithm
- Adding input validation to reject problematic inputs with a clear error
- At minimum, documenting the limitation (though this would be insufficient)

The high failure rate (56%) and large error magnitudes (up to 1.4) make this a significant issue that cannot be dismissed as a minor numerical precision problem.
