DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR scipy.fftpack.dct
=============================================

After reviewing the official scipy documentation for scipy.fftpack.dct, I found the following key information:

1. DCT TYPE REQUIREMENTS:
   - The documentation EXPLICITLY states that DCT Type I is "Only supported for input size > 1"
   - This is clearly documented in the official scipy documentation
   - DCT Types II, III, and IV have no such restriction documented

2. INPUT SIZE SPECIFICATIONS:
   - The function accepts arrays of various sizes
   - The parameter 'n' can be used to specify output size (with truncation or zero-padding)
   - For Type I specifically, there is a documented requirement that input size must be greater than 1

3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   - The documentation clearly states that Type I DCT requires input arrays with more than one element
   - This is not an undocumented limitation - it is explicitly mentioned in the official documentation
   - The behavior of raising an error for single-element arrays with Type I is therefore documented and expected

4. MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND:
   - DCT Type I has a specific mathematical definition that inherently requires at least 2 points
   - The DCT-I transformation is defined for sequences of length N â‰¥ 2
   - This is related to the boundary conditions of the DCT-I which treats both ends as even symmetry points

5. CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER TYPES:
   - While Types II, III, and IV work with single-element arrays, Type I has a documented exception
   - Each DCT type has different mathematical properties and boundary conditions
   - The documentation does not promise uniform behavior across all DCT types

CONCLUSION:
The documentation clearly states that DCT Type I requires input size > 1. The RuntimeError for single-element arrays with Type I is therefore EXPECTED BEHAVIOR according to the documentation, not a bug.
