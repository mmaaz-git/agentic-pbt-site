## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation
The docstring for `scipy.datasets.clear_cache` (both in the source code and online documentation) clearly states:

**Parameter specification**:
- `datasets : callable or list/tuple of callable or None`

This explicitly requires that when `datasets` is not None, it must be:
1. A single callable (a dataset method)
2. A list/tuple of callables
3. None (to clear all cached files)

The documentation does not allow for:
- Integers
- Strings (unless they are callable)
- Lists of non-callables
- Any other non-callable types

### Code Implementation
The source code contains an explicit validation check:
- Line 36: `assert callable(dataset)`

This assertion shows clear developer intent to enforce the documented contract. The use of `assert` indicates this is a programming error check - the developers expect only callables to be passed.

### Documentation Clarity
The documentation is unambiguous about the expected parameter types. The parameter description "callable or list/tuple of callable or None" leaves no room for interpretation - non-callable values are not permitted.

### Error Handling Specification
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state what exception will be raised for invalid inputs, the presence of the `assert` statement in the code indicates that:
1. Invalid inputs should cause an error (AssertionError in this implementation)
2. The function is not designed to gracefully handle non-callable inputs

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly establishes a contract that the `datasets` parameter must be callable(s) or None. The bug report correctly identifies that this contract is violated when the function accepts non-callable inputs without raising an error (when the cache directory doesn't exist).
