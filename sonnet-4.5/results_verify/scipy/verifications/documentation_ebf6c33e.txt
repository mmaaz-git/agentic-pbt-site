# Documentation Analysis

## SciPy Documentation Review

### copy() Method Documentation
The official SciPy documentation for scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.copy() states:
- "Returns copy of this matrix"
- "No data/indices will be shared between the returned value and current matrix"
- The documentation is minimal and does not explicitly specify what attributes or internal state should be preserved

### has_canonical_format Attribute
- No official documentation found for the has_canonical_format attribute
- It is not mentioned in the main sparse matrix documentation
- It is not documented in the sum_duplicates() method documentation

### sum_duplicates() Method Documentation
- Documented as an "in place" operation that "eliminates duplicate entries by adding them together"
- No mention of canonical format or the has_canonical_format flag
- No specification of how this interacts with copy()

## Documentation Gaps

1. **Undocumented Attribute**: has_canonical_format is an undocumented internal attribute that:
   - Exists on COO matrix instances
   - Is set to True after sum_duplicates() is called
   - Serves as an optimization flag to avoid redundant duplicate checking
   - Is not preserved by copy()

2. **Unclear copy() Semantics**: The documentation doesn't specify:
   - Whether internal optimization flags should be preserved
   - What constitutes a "complete" copy
   - Whether only data or also metadata/state should be copied

3. **Performance Implications Not Documented**: The documentation doesn't mention:
   - That has_canonical_format affects performance
   - That copying a matrix with sum_duplicates() already called loses this optimization

## Interpretation

While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that copy() should preserve all internal state, there are strong reasons to expect it should:

1. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Users expect copy() to create an identical object
2. **Performance Preservation**: Optimization state is part of the object's value
3. **Consistency**: The data is identical, so the metadata about that data should be too
4. **Analogous Behavior**: Other sparse matrix implementations may preserve similar flags (though has_sorted_indices handling varies)

The lack of documentation about has_canonical_format doesn't make this behavior correct - it makes it undocumented behavior that should follow reasonable expectations.
