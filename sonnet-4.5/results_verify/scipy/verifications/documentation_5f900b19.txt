Documentation Analysis for scipy.constants.precision()

OFFICIAL SCIPY DOCUMENTATION:
The official documentation for scipy.constants.precision() states:
- Function: scipy.constants.precision(key)
- Description: Returns the relative precision of a physical constant specified by its key
- Returns: float - "Relative precision corresponding to the specified key"
- Example shows: constants.precision('proton mass') returns 5.1e-37 (a positive value)

The documentation DOES NOT explicitly state:
- Whether relative precision should always be positive
- The exact mathematical formula for calculating relative precision
- How negative values should be handled

SOURCE CODE EXAMINATION:
The actual implementation is:
```python
return physical_constants[key][2] / physical_constants[key][0]
```
This divides the uncertainty (index 2) by the value (index 0) directly, without taking absolute values.

MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION FROM PHYSICS:
Based on general physics references and web search:
- Relative precision/uncertainty in physics is defined as the ratio of absolute uncertainty to the magnitude of the measured value
- It represents a measure of uncertainty and should always be a non-negative quantity
- Standard physics practice is that relative uncertainty = |absolute uncertainty / value| or absolute uncertainty / |value|
- Relative uncertainty is universally treated as a positive quantity in physics because it represents the magnitude of uncertainty, not a signed value

KEY FINDING:
The scipy documentation does not explicitly specify that relative precision should always be positive. However, the standard physics definition of relative precision/uncertainty universally treats it as a non-negative quantity. The example in the documentation shows a positive value (5.1e-37 for 'proton mass'), which could imply an expectation of positive values, but this is not explicitly stated.
