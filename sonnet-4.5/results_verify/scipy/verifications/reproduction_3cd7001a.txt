REPRODUCTION RESULTS
====================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is real and consistent with the description.

Test 1: Bug Reproduction (cache directory doesn't exist)
---------------------------------------------------------
When running the reproduction script with a non-existent cache directory:
- Input: Invalid dataset callable with name "not_a_dataset"
- Cache directory: /tmp/scipy_test_nonexistent (does not exist)
- Expected: ValueError should be raised saying "Dataset method not_a_dataset doesn't exist"
- Actual: Function returns early with message "Cache Directory /tmp/scipy_test_nonexistent doesn't exist. Nothing to clear." without raising ValueError
- Result: BUG CONFIRMED

Test 2: Control Test (cache directory exists)
----------------------------------------------
When running the same code with an existing cache directory:
- Input: Invalid dataset callable with name "not_a_dataset"
- Cache directory: /tmp/scipy_test_existing (exists)
- Expected: ValueError should be raised
- Actual: ValueError is correctly raised with message "Dataset method not_a_dataset doesn't exist. Please check if the passed dataset is a subset of the following dataset methods: ['ascent', 'electrocardiogram', 'face']"
- Result: Behaves as expected when cache exists

Test 3: Hypothesis Property-Based Test
---------------------------------------
The Hypothesis test confirms the inconsistency:
- When cache_exists=True: Test passes (ValueError is raised as expected)
- When cache_exists=False: Test fails with "Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>"
- The test demonstrates that the validation behavior is dependent on filesystem state

Code Analysis
-------------
Looking at _utils.py lines 24-26, the function has an early return when the cache directory doesn't exist:
```python
if not os.path.exists(cache_dir):
    print(f"Cache Directory {cache_dir} doesn't exist. Nothing to clear.")
    return
```

This early return occurs BEFORE the validation logic at lines 36-42:
```python
assert callable(dataset)
dataset_name = dataset.__name__
if dataset_name not in method_map:
    raise ValueError(f"Dataset method {dataset_name} doesn't exist...")
```

This creates inconsistent behavior where invalid input is sometimes accepted (when cache doesn't exist) and sometimes rejected (when cache exists), violating the principle of consistent input validation.

The bug is fully reproduced and confirmed.
