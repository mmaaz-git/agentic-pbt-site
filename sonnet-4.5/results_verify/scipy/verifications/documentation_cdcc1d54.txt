Documentation Analysis for scipy.odr.ODR.set_iprint
=====================================================

Based on analysis of the SciPy documentation and source code docstring:

1. DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR:
   The method docstring explicitly states:
   - "one cannot specify to print to stdout but not a file since one can do that by not specifying a rptfile filename"
   - Parameters init and so_init can be 0, 1, or 2 for "no report", "short report", and "long report"
   - "If the rptfile is None, then any so_* arguments supplied will raise an exception"

2. KEY CONSTRAINT:
   The documentation clearly indicates that the combination of printing to stdout without printing to file is INTENTIONALLY not supported. The design philosophy is:
   - If you want stdout only: Don't specify a rptfile
   - If you specify a rptfile: You must print to file if you want stdout output

3. ERROR HANDLING EXPECTATION:
   The documentation does mention that certain invalid combinations will raise exceptions. Specifically, it states that if rptfile is None and so_* arguments are provided, an exception will be raised. However, it does not explicitly describe what happens for the inverse case (rptfile is specified, but trying to print to stdout without printing to file).

4. SEMANTIC LOGIC:
   The parameter combination init=0, so_init=1 means:
   - init=0: Don't print initialization report to file
   - so_init=1: Print short initialization report to stdout

   This combination is logically contradictory based on the documented design: you cannot print to stdout without also printing to file when rptfile is specified.

5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:
   The ip2arg lookup table in the code only includes valid combinations that respect the constraint "if printing to stdout, must also print to file". The combinations [0,1] and [0,2] are intentionally excluded from the valid combinations list.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation clearly states this behavior is intentional and by design. The constraint that you cannot print to stdout without printing to file (when rptfile is specified) is explicitly documented. However, the error message when this constraint is violated is poor - it raises a generic ValueError instead of a meaningful OdrError explaining the constraint violation.
