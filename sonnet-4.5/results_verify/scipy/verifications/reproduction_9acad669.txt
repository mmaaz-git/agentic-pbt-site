REPRODUCTION TEST RESULTS
========================

1. BUG REPORT CLAIM vs ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:

   CLAIM: Function returns the unmodified input array
   ACTUAL: Function returns a MODIFIED array, but with INCORRECT values (inf on diagonal instead of 0)

   The bug report's claim is partially incorrect. The function does NOT return the "unmodified input array". Instead:
   - With C-contiguous arrays: Returns correct shortest paths with diagonal = 0
   - With F-contiguous arrays: Returns INCORRECT results with diagonal = inf

2. DETAILED TEST RESULTS:

   A. Simple 3x3 Random Graph Test:
      - C-contiguous + overwrite=True: Diagonal = [0, 0, 0] ✓ CORRECT
      - F-contiguous + overwrite=True: Diagonal = [inf, inf, inf] ✗ INCORRECT
      - C-contiguous + overwrite=False: Diagonal = [0, 0, 0] ✓ CORRECT
      - F-contiguous + overwrite=False: Diagonal = [inf, inf, inf] ✗ INCORRECT

   B. Property Test (Hypothesis):
      - Test FAILS for all values of n >= 3
      - C-contiguous and F-contiguous arrays produce different results
      - This violates the invariant that results should be identical regardless of memory layout

   C. Exception Behavior:
      - A ValueError IS raised internally: "ndarray is not C-contiguous"
      - The exception IS ignored/suppressed by the C extension
      - Error message appears in stderr but doesn't propagate to Python

3. CRITICAL FINDING:
   The bug is MORE SEVERE than reported. The function doesn't just return the input unchanged - it returns WRONG RESULTS:
   - Sets diagonal to inf instead of 0
   - This completely breaks the shortest path computation
   - The results are mathematically incorrect (distance from node to itself should be 0, not infinity)

4. SCOPE OF BUG:
   - Affects ALL F-contiguous arrays regardless of overwrite parameter
   - Affects both overwrite=True AND overwrite=False
   - Not limited to overwrite=True as the bug report suggests
   - Also affects float32 arrays, not just float64

5. VERIFICATION OF FLOYD-WARSHALL ALGORITHM:
   When working correctly (C-contiguous), the function properly computes:
   - Diagonal elements as 0 (distance to self)
   - Shortest paths between all node pairs
   - Handles disconnected nodes (inf values) correctly

6. CORE ISSUE:
   The F-contiguous array handling is fundamentally broken. The function:
   - Raises an internal exception that gets suppressed
   - Returns incorrect mathematical results
   - Violates the basic invariant of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm
