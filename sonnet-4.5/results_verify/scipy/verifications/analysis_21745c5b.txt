BUG REPORT CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS
===================================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID - Arguments Against:
   - The behavior is correctly documented and implemented as designed
   - rsplit() never promised to have a regex parameter
   - The methods work as their documentation describes
   - No contract violation exists in the actual documentation

   Arguments For:
   - The bug report's core claim is factually correct (rsplit lacks regex parameter)
   - There is an inconsistency between conceptually related methods

2. WONTFIX - Arguments Against:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - regex handling is a common use case
   - The inconsistency affects real-world usage patterns
   - Users reasonably expect mirror operations to have similar capabilities

   Arguments For:
   - The current behavior might be intentionally limited
   - rsplit() with regex might be complex to implement correctly
   - Workarounds exist (use split() with reversed string manipulation)

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Arguments Against:
   - The bug report frames this as a "bug" due to API inconsistency
   - split() already has the feature, suggesting rsplit() should too

   Arguments For:
   - rsplit() never had this parameter - it's not broken, just missing functionality
   - Adding regex parameter would be new functionality, not fixing broken behavior
   - The documentation doesn't promise this feature exists
   - This is an enhancement to make rsplit() more capable

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Arguments Against:
   - The documentation accurately describes current behavior
   - No misleading or incorrect documentation exists

   Arguments For:
   - Could argue documentation should clarify why rsplit() lacks regex support
   - Could better explain the differences between split() and rsplit()

5. BUG - Arguments Against:
   - The code works exactly as documented
   - No promise was broken - rsplit() never claimed to support regex parameter
   - The implementation matches the specification

   Arguments For:
   - API inconsistency between mirror operations
   - Violates principle of least surprise
   - Users reasonably expect similar methods to have similar parameters

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
=================
This is best categorized as a FEATURE_REQUEST. The reasoning:

1. The current implementation works correctly as documented
2. rsplit() never had the regex parameter - this would be adding new functionality
3. While there's an API inconsistency, this is a design limitation rather than broken code
4. The regex parameter was added to split() in v1.4.0 but not to rsplit() - this appears to be an intentional or overlooked enhancement opportunity
5. The bug report essentially requests feature parity between related methods

The key distinction: A bug is when code doesn't work as specified. A feature request is when code works as specified but users want additional capabilities. This clearly falls into the latter category since rsplit() works exactly as its documentation describes - it just lacks a feature that its sibling method has.
