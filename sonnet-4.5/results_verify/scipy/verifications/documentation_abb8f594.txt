## Documentation Analysis for scipy.integrate.simpson

### Official Documentation Review:

The scipy.integrate.simpson documentation states:
- **Purpose**: "Integrate y(x) using samples along the given axis and the composite Simpson's rule"
- **Parameters**: Accepts y array and optional x array of sampling points
- **Accuracy**: "For an odd number of samples that are equally spaced the result is exact if the function is a polynomial of order 3 or less. If the samples are not equally spaced, then the result is exact only if the function is a polynomial of order 2 or less."

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **No mention of duplicate x values**: The documentation does not specify behavior when x contains duplicate values or zero-width intervals.

2. **No input validation requirements**: The documentation doesn't state that x values must be unique or strictly increasing.

3. **Mathematical expectations**: The documentation promises exactness for polynomials up to order 2 (unequally spaced) or 3 (equally spaced). A constant function is a polynomial of order 0, so it should be integrated exactly.

4. **Comparison with trapezoid**: Both simpson and trapezoid are part of the same integration module and should handle similar input cases consistently.

### Mathematical Foundation:

Simpson's rule mathematically requires fitting a parabola through sets of three points. The standard composite Simpson's rule formula assumes:
- Points are ordered
- Each subinterval has a defined width (xi+1 - xi)
- The method weights interior points with alternating factors of 4 and 2

When duplicate x values exist:
- The interval width becomes zero (xi+1 - xi = 0)
- The mathematical formula becomes ill-defined
- The contribution of that interval should logically be zero

### Documentation Gaps:

1. **Unspecified behavior**: The documentation doesn't specify what happens with duplicate x values
2. **No warnings**: No warnings about potential issues with zero-width intervals
3. **Inconsistency**: trapezoid handles this case correctly, suggesting simpson should too
4. **Mathematical violation**: For a constant function y=c, the integral over [a,b] must equal c*(b-a) regardless of sampling - this is a fundamental mathematical property

### Conclusion:

The documentation does not explicitly forbid duplicate x values, nor does it warn about incorrect results in such cases. Given that:
1. A constant function is a polynomial of order 0 (should be exact)
2. trapezoid handles the same input correctly
3. The mathematical expectation is unambiguous (integral of constant = c*(b-a))

The current behavior violates implicit mathematical expectations that any reasonable user would have, even if not explicitly documented.
