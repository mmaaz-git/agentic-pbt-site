## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
This is an internal/private function (indicated by the underscore prefix _report_error) that is never exposed to users directly. The function is only called internally by the ODR class, and users never interact with it directly. The docstring doesn't explicitly promise that the list must be non-empty - it just says it returns "a list of messages." An empty list is still technically a list. Furthermore, in practical usage testing, we could not generate any info codes with I[0] >= 7, suggesting these codes may never occur in real ODRPACK usage. The bug report is testing an internal implementation detail with artificial values that may not be reachable through the public API.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function's purpose is to "interpret the return code" and provide messages "about why the odr() routine stopped." An empty list fails to fulfill this purpose since it provides no information about why the routine stopped. The docstring uses "messages" (plural), implying at least one message should be present. The function is designed to handle all possible info codes, and leaving some unhandled is a gap in the implementation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an obscure edge case affecting an internal function that users never call directly. Info codes with I[0] >= 7 don't appear to occur in normal ODRPACK usage based on testing various problematic inputs. The impact is minimal since users only see the stopreason attribute indirectly, and having an empty list for impossible error codes doesn't break anything functionally. The fix would add code to handle error codes that may never actually occur in practice, adding unnecessary complexity.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even if rare, returning an empty list violates the semantic contract of explaining why the routine stopped. If these codes can theoretically be generated by the underlying ODRPACK library, they should be handled properly. The fix is trivial (adding an else clause) and would make the code more robust and complete.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The docstring could be updated to clarify that the function may return an empty list for undefined or unknown error codes. This would align the documentation with the actual behavior. The function is internal and its exact behavior for all edge cases doesn't need to be fully specified since users don't call it directly.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current documentation is not incorrect about what the function is supposed to do - it's the implementation that fails to match the documented purpose. Changing the documentation to allow empty lists would be documenting a bug rather than fixing it.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting info codes with I[0] >= 7 could be seen as adding new functionality to handle previously unsupported error codes from ODRPACK. The current implementation only handles codes 0-6, and extending this could be viewed as a new feature.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but rather pointing out that existing functionality doesn't handle all inputs correctly. The function already claims to interpret return codes, so handling all possible codes is part of its existing contract, not a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function fails to fulfill its documented purpose for certain inputs. It's supposed to provide messages about why the ODR routine stopped, but returns an empty list for info codes with I[0] >= 7, providing no information. The implementation has an incomplete if-elif chain without a fallback case, which is a logic error. The hypothesis test correctly identifies inputs where the function fails to meet reasonable expectations.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is an internal function that users never call directly, and the problematic info codes don't appear to occur in practice. The docstring doesn't explicitly guarantee non-empty lists. Testing with various problematic ODR configurations couldn't generate these error codes, suggesting they may be theoretical rather than practical issues. The function works correctly for all info codes that ODRPACK actually generates.

**Overall consideration**
This bug report concerns an internal implementation detail of SciPy's ODR module. The _report_error function is marked as private (underscore prefix) and is never called directly by users - it's only used internally to populate the stopreason attribute of ODR output. The reported issue is technically accurate: the function does return an empty list for info codes where I[0] >= 7, which fails to provide any information about why the ODR routine stopped.

However, extensive testing with various problematic inputs (NaN values, empty data, bad initial guesses) could not generate any info codes with I[0] >= 7. All real-world test cases generated info codes that are properly handled by the existing implementation. This suggests these problematic codes may never occur in actual ODRPACK usage, making this a theoretical rather than practical issue. The bug report uses artificially constructed info values (70000, 80000, 90000) that don't appear to be reachable through normal API usage.

While the fix would be trivial (adding an else clause), this falls into the category of an obscure edge case in an internal function that has no practical impact. The function is not part of the public API, the problematic codes don't occur in practice, and even if they did, the worst outcome would be an empty stopreason list that users might not even check. This makes it a low-priority issue that maintainers would likely close as WONTFIX due to its negligible real-world impact.
