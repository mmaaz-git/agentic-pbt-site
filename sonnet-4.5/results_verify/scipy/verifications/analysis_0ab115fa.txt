## Bug Report Analysis and Categorization

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: The function behaves differently based on filesystem state (cache directory existence) for the same invalid input
2. **Contract violation**: The documentation explicitly states `datasets` must be "callable or list/tuple of callable or None"
3. **Developer intent clear**: The code contains `assert callable(dataset)` on line 36, showing the developers intended to validate inputs
4. **Fail-fast principle violated**: Input validation should happen regardless of system state
5. **API consistency**: Users expect consistent behavior - if an input is invalid, it should always be invalid

**Why it is definitely a BUG:**
- The function has a clear validation check that is being bypassed due to ordering of operations
- This creates a situation where the same code might work in development (no cache) but fail in production (with cache)
- The assertion exists but isn't being reached, which is clearly unintentional

### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None applicable. The documentation is clear and the behavior is inconsistent.

### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. **Low severity**: The bug only manifests when the cache directory doesn't exist
2. **No data corruption**: Invalid inputs when cache doesn't exist don't cause any harm - they just return early
3. **Edge case**: Users are unlikely to pass non-callables to this function in practice

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The inconsistent behavior could cause confusion and debugging difficulties
- The fix is trivial (just reorder the checks)
- It violates the principle of least surprise

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Not applicable. The documentation correctly describes the expected behavior. The code is wrong, not the docs.

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Not applicable. This is not requesting new functionality but reporting incorrect behavior of existing functionality.

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has documented requirements for its parameters, contains explicit validation code to enforce these requirements, but fails to execute that validation in certain cases due to an early return. This creates inconsistent behavior where the same invalid input is sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected based on filesystem state, which violates both the documented contract and the principle of consistent API behavior.
