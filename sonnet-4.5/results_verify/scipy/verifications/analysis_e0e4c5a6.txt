TRIAGE ANALYSIS FOR BUG REPORT

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID - Why it might be INVALID:
   - The documentation does state that reshape=False maintains the original shape
   - The function technically works "as documented" in that it keeps the shape
   - User could argue they should expect issues when forcing wrong shape

   Why it is NOT INVALID:
   - The behavior violates fundamental mathematical properties (360° rotation = identity)
   - Single 360° rotation works correctly, showing inconsistency
   - Silent data corruption is never acceptable behavior
   - The same operation works correctly with reshape=True and square arrays

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be WONTFIX:
   - Users could use reshape=True to avoid the issue
   - Could be considered an edge case
   - Fixing might break backward compatibility

   Why it is NOT WONTFIX:
   - This causes severe data loss (exponential degradation)
   - It's a silent failure with no warnings
   - The mathematical property violation is fundamental
   - Affects all non-square arrays, not just edge cases
   - Data integrity issues are always worth fixing

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - Could argue that proper handling of reshape=False with non-square arrays is a "new feature"
   - The current behavior might be considered "working as designed"

   Why it is NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - This is clearly broken behavior, not missing functionality
   - The function already claims to support rotation with reshape=False
   - Mathematical correctness is not a "feature" but a requirement

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation doesn't warn about this behavior
   - Could add warnings about using reshape=False with non-square arrays
   - Documentation could clarify expected behavior

   Why it is NOT JUST DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The code behavior is fundamentally broken, not just poorly documented
   - No amount of documentation makes exponential data loss acceptable
   - The inconsistency with single 360° rotation shows a code bug
   - Other rotation implementations handle this correctly

5. BUG - Why it IS a BUG:
   - Violates mathematical identity: 4×90° should equal 360° rotation
   - Causes severe, exponential data degradation (1.0 → 0.125)
   - Silent data corruption without warnings
   - Inconsistent behavior: single 360° works, but 4×90° fails
   - Works correctly with square arrays and reshape=True
   - The degradation pattern (halving each time) suggests accumulating numerical errors
   - Fundamental expectation in image processing that rotations compose correctly
   - The function provides no warning about data loss

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is clearly a BUG. The function exhibits incorrect behavior that violates fundamental mathematical properties and causes silent data corruption. While the documentation could be improved, the core issue is in the implementation, not the documentation. The exponential degradation of data values and the inconsistency between single 360° rotation (which works) and four 90° rotations (which fails) definitively shows this is a code bug, not a documentation or feature issue.
