## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function could be argued to be working as designed if there was an intentional choice to use a different indexing convention. Some mathematical software packages do use different conventions for Jacobian matrices, and if SciPy had chosen to document this as using the "denominator layout" convention, it might not be a bug.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states that for f: R^m → R^n, the Jacobian should be shape (n, m), and the referenced Wikipedia article confirms the standard mathematical definition where J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j. The implementation clearly violates this documented behavior by returning J[i,j] = ∂f_j/∂x_i. This is not a matter of convention but a clear discrepancy between documented and actual behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered WONTFIX if the transposition issue has been present for a long time and changing it would break backward compatibility for existing users who have worked around the bug. Additionally, users can easily work around it by transposing the result themselves.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a fundamental mathematical error that affects the correctness of all calculations using this function. It's not an obscure edge case or minor inconvenience - it returns mathematically incorrect results that will propagate errors through any scientific computation, optimization, or machine learning application that uses it. The severity and impact make it unlikely to be dismissed as WONTFIX.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the implementation was intentionally designed this way for performance or other reasons, the fix could be to update the documentation to correctly describe what the function actually returns (the transpose of the standard Jacobian).

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation already clearly states the expected behavior and references the standard mathematical definition. The examples in the documentation work only because they use square matrices or don't carefully verify the element positions. Changing the documentation to match the incorrect implementation would mean SciPy's Jacobian function doesn't compute the standard mathematical Jacobian, which would be highly unusual and confusing.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that the current behavior is the default and a new parameter could be added to return the mathematically correct Jacobian (e.g., `transpose=True` to get the correct result).

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but pointing out that the existing function doesn't do what it claims to do. The function is supposed to compute the Jacobian matrix as defined in mathematics, and it fails to do so. This is a bug in the existing functionality, not a request for something new.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function returns the transpose of the mathematically correct Jacobian matrix, violating both its documentation and the standard mathematical definition. The documentation at line 819-820 explicitly states the result should be shape (n, m) for f: R^m → R^n, and references Wikipedia's standard definition where J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j. The implementation returns J[i,j] = ∂f_j/∂x_i instead. This is a clear, reproducible error that will cause incorrect results in any application using this function for gradient-based optimization, sensitivity analysis, or other scientific computing tasks.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There are very few reasons this wouldn't be a bug. The only possibility would be if there was some hidden documentation or design decision that explicitly chose this non-standard convention, but no such documentation exists, and the function's own documentation contradicts the actual behavior.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report describes a serious mathematical error in scipy.differentiate.jacobian. The function returns the transpose of the Jacobian matrix, contradicting both its documentation and the standard mathematical definition. I've thoroughly verified this through multiple approaches:

1. The documentation explicitly states the Jacobian for f: R^m → R^n should be shape (n, m) with element [i,j] representing ∂f_i/∂x_j
2. The implementation demonstrably returns a matrix where element [i,j] contains ∂f_j/∂x_i (the transpose)
3. Independent verification using manual finite differences confirms the mathematical definition
4. The bug is reproducible across all matrix sizes and shapes tested

The root cause analysis in the bug report is accurate - the issue stems from how the `wrapped` function and `derivative` interact, leading to swapped indices. While one might consider documenting this as the intended behavior (DOCUMENTATION_FIX) or ignoring it due to potential backward compatibility concerns (WONTFIX), the severity of returning mathematically incorrect derivatives makes this a clear BUG. This function is likely used in optimization, machine learning, and scientific computing where incorrect gradients will cause algorithms to fail or converge to wrong solutions. The fact that the documentation already specifies the correct behavior and references the standard mathematical definition further confirms this is unintended behavior that needs to be fixed.
