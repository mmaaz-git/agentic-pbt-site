## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation clearly states the formula n = 2*(m-1), and the code implements exactly what is documented. The error occurs precisely because the documented formula is being followed. Users could argue that if the documentation says n = 2*(m-1), and for m=1 this gives 0, then the error is expected behavior. The documentation doesn't promise that all input sizes will work without specifying n.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The function fails on a mathematically valid operation. Single-element FFTs are well-defined operations, and the function works correctly when n=1 is explicitly provided. The failure is due to a formula that produces an invalid default, not because the operation itself is invalid. The round-trip property mentioned in the docs (irfft(rfft(x), len(x)) == x) fails for single-element arrays without the explicit length parameter.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Single-element FFTs are an extreme edge case that rarely occurs in practice. Most signal processing applications work with arrays of meaningful size. Users encountering this can easily work around it by checking array size and providing n=1 explicitly. The fix might complicate the code for a case that affects very few users. The current formula n = 2*(m-1) works correctly for all m > 1, which covers 99.9% of use cases.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a case where the function crashes rather than handling the edge case gracefully. FFT libraries should handle all valid input sizes, as they may be used in generic algorithms that process variable-length data. The fix is trivial (use max(1, 2*(m-1)) or special-case m=1), so there's no good reason to leave it broken. Other FFT implementations (like numpy.fft) handle this case.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation accurately describes the formula being used (n = 2*(m-1)), so the code is working as documented. The fix could be to update the documentation to explicitly state that for single-element inputs, n must be provided explicitly. This would clarify the current behavior without changing any code. The documentation could add a note about the minimum input size requirement.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The issue isn't that the documentation is wrong or misleading - it correctly describes the formula. The problem is that the formula itself produces an invalid value for a valid input case. Documenting a limitation doesn't make it less of a bug when the operation is mathematically valid and works with explicit parameters. Users expect FFT functions to work on any size input.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting single-element arrays without explicit n could be seen as a new feature rather than a bug fix. The current implementation matches its documentation, and adding special handling for m=1 would be extending functionality beyond what was originally designed. This could be viewed as requesting enhanced edge case handling rather than fixing broken behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
FFT operations on single elements are not a new feature - they're mathematically well-defined and the function already supports them with n=1. The issue is with the default parameter calculation, not with missing functionality. The function can already perform the operation; it just fails to calculate a valid default. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes on mathematically valid input that has a well-defined result. The operation works correctly when n is explicitly provided, proving the issue is with the default calculation, not the operation itself. The documented round-trip property fails for single-element arrays. Other FFT implementations handle this case without error. The fix is straightforward and doesn't break backward compatibility.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The code is working exactly as documented - the formula n = 2*(m-1) is being applied correctly. The documentation doesn't promise that the default n calculation will work for all input sizes. Users can easily work around this by providing n explicitly. The error message clearly indicates the problem (invalid number of data points).

## Overall consideration

This case presents an interesting edge where the code correctly implements its documented formula, but that formula produces an invalid result for a valid (though edge case) input. The key question is whether we prioritize "working as documented" versus "working for all mathematically valid inputs."

The strongest argument for this being a BUG is that the function fails on a mathematically well-defined operation that it can successfully perform with explicit parameters. The failure is not due to the operation being impossible or undefined, but because the default parameter calculation produces an invalid value. The round-trip property explicitly mentioned in the documentation (irfft(rfft(x), len(x)) == x) fails without warning for single-element arrays.

However, there's a reasonable argument that this is either WONTFIX (too much of an edge case) or DOCUMENTATION_FIX (just document the limitation). The code is implementing exactly what the documentation says, and single-element FFTs are rare in practice. The error message is clear, and the workaround is simple. Given that the formula n = 2*(m-1) is explicitly documented and the code follows it exactly, updating the documentation to note this limitation might be the most appropriate response.
