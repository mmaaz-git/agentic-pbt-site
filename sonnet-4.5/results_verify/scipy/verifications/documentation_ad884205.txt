DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. SciPy Documentation for savemat:
   - The oned_as parameter is documented as: "If 'column', write 1-D NumPy arrays as column vectors.
     If 'row', write 1-D NumPy arrays as row vectors."
   - The documentation does NOT specify any special behavior for empty 1D arrays
   - The documentation does NOT say empty arrays should be treated differently
   - Therefore, users would reasonably expect empty 1D arrays to follow the same rules

2. SciPy Documentation for matdims function:
   - The docstring in _miobase.py includes examples showing:
     * matdims(np.array([])) returns (0, 0)
     * matdims(np.array([1,2])) returns (2, 1) in column mode
     * matdims(np.array([1,2]), 'row') returns (1, 2) in row mode
   - HOWEVER, there is no example showing matdims(np.array([]), 'row') or 'column'
   - The documentation example shows the current behavior but doesn't justify WHY
     empty arrays ignore the oned_as parameter

3. MATLAB Documentation:
   - MATLAB distinguishes between different empty array shapes:
     * Empty row vectors are 1×0
     * Empty column vectors are 0×1
     * Generic empty matrices can be 0×0
   - MATLAB explicitly supports and uses these different empty shapes
   - The documentation shows find() can return "1×0 empty double row vector"
   - This confirms that MATLAB does have the concept of oriented empty vectors

4. Consistency Analysis:
   - The savemat function claims to save data in MATLAB format
   - MATLAB supports oriented empty vectors (1×0 vs 0×1)
   - The oned_as parameter exists specifically to control vector orientation
   - The documentation doesn't exempt empty arrays from this control
   - Therefore, users would expect empty arrays to respect the oned_as parameter

5. Documentation Gap:
   - If the current behavior (always returning (0,0) for empty 1D arrays) were intentional,
     it should be explicitly documented
   - The fact that it's not documented suggests this is likely an oversight
   - The example in matdims shows the behavior but doesn't explain it's intentional

Conclusion:
The documentation supports the bug report's claim. The oned_as parameter should apply
to ALL 1D arrays according to the documentation, with no exemption for empty arrays.
The current behavior contradicts both the documented intent and MATLAB's capabilities.
