## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The matdims function's docstring explicitly documents that empty 1D arrays become (0, 0). This is shown in the examples at line 302-303 of _miobase.py. Since this behavior is documented in the code's docstring, it's not a bug but the intended behavior. Additionally, MATLAB doesn't have true 1D arrays - everything is at least 2D. An empty array in MATLAB would naturally be (0, 0), not (0,). The conversion to (0, 0) aligns with MATLAB's array model. The round-trip issue can be resolved using squeeze_me=True parameter in loadmat, which is a documented feature.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The loadmat documentation explicitly states that the default settings allow "easier round-trip load and save of MATLAB files." The current behavior breaks this documented promise for empty 1D arrays. The inconsistency between empty and non-empty 1D arrays violates the principle of least surprise - developers would expect empty arrays to follow the same oned_as rules as non-empty arrays.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Empty 1D arrays are an edge case that rarely occurs in practical MATLAB interoperability scenarios. The workaround (using squeeze_me=True) exists and works. Changing this behavior could break existing code that depends on empty 1D arrays becoming (0, 0). The current behavior has been in place for a long time (the docstring even mentions scipy 0.11), suggesting it's established behavior that users may rely on.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency creates a special case that developers must remember and handle separately. The fix is trivial (removing 2 lines of code) and would make the behavior more consistent and predictable. The issue affects a core promise of the library (round-trip compatibility) which shouldn't be dismissed as unimportant.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The matdims docstring already documents that empty 1D arrays become (0, 0), so the code is working as documented at that level. The issue might be that the higher-level loadmat documentation's claim about "easier round-trip" is too broad and should clarify that empty 1D arrays are an exception. The documentation could be updated to explicitly mention this special case and the squeeze_me workaround.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The loadmat documentation's promise of round-trip compatibility is clear and unqualified. Users reading that documentation would reasonably expect ALL arrays to round-trip properly, not just non-empty ones. The inconsistent behavior between empty and non-empty arrays suggests the code is wrong, not the documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current code doesn't handle empty 1D arrays consistently with non-empty ones. Adding consistent handling could be seen as a new feature - extending the oned_as parameter to work with empty arrays. This would be an enhancement to make the library more predictable and user-friendly.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The loadmat documentation already promises round-trip compatibility, so this isn't asking for something new but rather fixing something that should already work. The oned_as parameter documentation doesn't say it only applies to non-empty arrays, so users would expect it to work consistently.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There is a clear inconsistency in behavior: non-empty 1D arrays respect the oned_as parameter (becoming either (n, 1) or (1, n)), while empty 1D arrays always become (0, 0). This violates the documented promise of round-trip compatibility in loadmat. The behavior contradicts user expectations based on how the library handles non-empty arrays. The fix is straightforward and would make the behavior consistent.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The matdims function's docstring explicitly shows this behavior in its examples. This suggests it was an intentional design decision, not an oversight. MATLAB's array model doesn't have true 1D arrays, so converting to (0, 0) could be seen as the most MATLAB-compatible choice. The existence of squeeze_me=True as a workaround suggests the developers were aware of this issue and provided a solution.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at all considerations, this issue sits at the intersection of documented behavior and user expectations. The matdims function clearly documents that empty 1D arrays become (0, 0), which suggests this is intentional behavior. However, this creates an inconsistency with how non-empty 1D arrays are handled with respect to the oned_as parameter. The key question is whether the explicit documentation in matdims overrides the implicit expectation of consistency.

The loadmat documentation's promise of "easier round-trip load and save" is compromised by this behavior, but only for the edge case of empty 1D arrays. The existence of the squeeze_me parameter provides a workaround, though it's not a perfect solution since squeeze on (0, 0) doesn't naturally return to (0,) the way it does for non-empty arrays that were expanded.

From a MATLAB compatibility perspective, the current behavior makes some sense since MATLAB doesn't have true 1D arrays. However, the inconsistent application of the oned_as parameter creates a special case that developers must handle differently. Given that the matdims docstring explicitly documents this behavior, and there's a workaround available, this leans toward being either INVALID (working as documented) or DOCUMENTATION_FIX (the high-level documentation should clarify this limitation).
