## Bug Report Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation explicitly states that keys starting with digits should trigger a warning and not be saved
- The current implementation violates this documented behavior in both aspects (no warning, data is saved)
- The behavior is inconsistent with how underscore-prefixed keys are handled
- This creates files that violate MATLAB's variable naming rules, potentially causing interoperability issues
- The bug is clearly reproducible and affects a documented feature

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. The documentation is explicit and the implementation clearly doesn't match.

#### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The documentation explicitly defines the expected behavior.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation clearly states what should happen with digit-prefixed keys
- This is not undefined behavior or an edge case not covered by documentation
- The test correctly expects behavior that is explicitly documented

#### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is not an obscure edge case.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This affects a core functionality of saving MATLAB files
- It creates files that may not be loadable in MATLAB
- The issue is clearly documented and users would expect it to work as described
- This is not an obscure corner case but a fundamental validation issue

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could argue that the documentation should be updated to match the current behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documented behavior is the correct one according to MATLAB's rules
- The implementation should match the documentation, not vice versa
- Changing the documentation would leave users creating invalid MATLAB files
- The underscore-prefix behavior already works as documented, showing the documentation is correct

#### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is already a documented feature that doesn't work.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation already promises this functionality
- This is not a new feature but a fix for existing documented behavior
- The feature partially works (for underscores) showing it was intended

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation fails to match explicitly documented behavior in two ways:
1. It doesn't issue the promised MatWriteWarning for digit-prefixed keys
2. It saves data with digit-prefixed keys when documentation says it won't

The bug has practical implications as it allows creation of .mat files with invalid variable names that MATLAB cannot load. The fix is straightforward - add the same validation for digit-prefixed keys that already exists for underscore-prefixed keys.
