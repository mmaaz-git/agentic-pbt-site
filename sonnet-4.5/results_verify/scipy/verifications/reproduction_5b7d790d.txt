## Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the key findings:

### Core Issue
The bug report is accurate. The `find()` function only searches through 355 current CODATA constants while `physical_constants` contains 445 keys total (90 obsolete constants are omitted).

### Test Results

1. **Basic reproduction test**:
   - `physical_constants` has 445 total keys
   - `find(None)` returns only 355 keys
   - Missing: 90 keys (obsolete constants from earlier CODATA versions)

2. **Specific obsolete constant test**:
   - The obsolete constant `'muon Compton wavelength over 2 pi'` exists in `physical_constants`
   - It is NOT returned by `find(None)` or `find('muon')`
   - When searching for 'muon', expected 28 matches but find() only returns 22

3. **Direct access verification**:
   - Obsolete constants ARE accessible via `physical_constants['key']`
   - They ARE accessible via `value('key')` function (with a warning)
   - Both methods issue a warning: "Constant 'muon Compton wavelength over 2 pi' is not in current CODATA 2022 data set"

### Conclusion
The bug is real and reproducible. The `find()` function searches only `_current_constants` (355 CODATA 2022 constants) instead of the full `physical_constants` dictionary (445 total constants including 90 obsolete ones). This creates an inconsistency where constants can be accessed but not discovered through search.
