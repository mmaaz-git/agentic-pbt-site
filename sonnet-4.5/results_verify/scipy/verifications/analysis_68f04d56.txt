## Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function violates the mathematical identity property JS(P,P) = 0 by returning NaN for all-zero inputs
- The documentation promises normalization ("will normalize p and q if they don't sum to 1.0") but fails silently with NaN
- The function generates RuntimeWarnings but still returns NaN instead of handling the error properly
- Other SciPy functions typically validate inputs and raise clear errors for invalid cases
- The issue causes downstream problems for users who may not expect NaN values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- All-zero vectors are not valid probability distributions mathematically
- The function technically works for all valid probability distributions
- Users shouldn't be passing invalid inputs in the first place

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments FOR:**
- All-zero vectors are mathematically invalid probability distributions
- The Jensen-Shannon divergence is only defined for proper probability distributions
- The user is testing with invalid inputs that violate the mathematical domain

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function accepts these inputs without error
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state all-zero vectors are invalid
- The normalization claim suggests the function should handle non-standard inputs
- Returning NaN silently is poor API design even for invalid inputs

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an extreme edge case (all zeros) unlikely in real usage
- The mathematical invalidity of the input makes this low priority
- The RuntimeWarning provides some indication of the problem

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Silent NaN returns can cause hard-to-debug issues
- The fix is simple and improves robustness
- Other users have reported related issues (#19436, #20083)

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code behavior (returning NaN) could be considered "correct" for invalid inputs
- The main issue is the documentation doesn't warn about this edge case
- Adding documentation about valid inputs would clarify expectations

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function promises normalization but fails to deliver
- Silent NaN returns are generally poor API design
- Documentation alone doesn't fix the poor error handling

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments FOR:**
- Adding validation for all-zero inputs is a new feature
- The original implementation didn't include this edge case handling
- This is requesting enhanced error checking beyond original scope

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The identity property JS(P,P) = 0 is fundamental, not a feature
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Proper error handling is expected, not an enhancement

## Recommendation: BUG

This should be classified as a **BUG** for the following reasons:

1. **Violates fundamental property**: The identity property (distance to self = 0) is mathematically fundamental and should hold even for edge cases, either by returning 0 or raising a clear error.

2. **Silent failure is poor design**: Returning NaN without proper error handling violates principles of good API design. The function should either:
   - Raise a clear ValueError for invalid inputs, OR
   - Handle the edge case gracefully (though this would be mathematically questionable)

3. **Documentation promises normalization**: The claim "will normalize p and q if they don't sum to 1.0" creates an expectation that the function handles non-standard inputs, but it fails for zero-sum cases.

4. **Practical impact**: Users may encounter this in real scenarios (e.g., empty categories in classification, uninitialized arrays) and the silent NaN can propagate causing hard-to-debug issues.

5. **Simple fix available**: The bug report provides a straightforward fix that improves robustness without breaking valid use cases.

The proposed fix (raising ValueError for all-zero inputs) is appropriate and aligns with good API design principles.
