## Documentation Analysis for scipy.constants.precision()

### Official Documentation Review

1. **Function Docstring** (from source code and help):
   - States: "Relative precision in physical_constants indexed by key"
   - Returns: "prec : float - Relative precision in `physical_constants` corresponding to `key`"
   - Example shows: `constants.precision('proton mass')` returns `5.1e-37`

2. **Online Documentation** (scipy.org):
   - Confirms the function returns "relative precision"
   - Same example with same incorrect output value

3. **Implementation** (from source code):
   ```python
   return physical_constants[key][2] / physical_constants[key][0]
   ```
   This divides uncertainty (index 2) by value (index 0), which is the definition of relative precision.

### Key Findings

1. **Documentation is clear about intent**: The function is documented to return "relative precision," which in scientific/engineering contexts means the ratio of uncertainty to value (a dimensionless quantity).

2. **Implementation matches documented intent**: The code correctly calculates relative precision as uncertainty/value.

3. **Example output is wrong**: The example shows `5.1e-37` which is:
   - Very close to the absolute uncertainty of proton mass (`5.2e-37`)
   - NOT the relative precision which should be `3.11e-10`

4. **Terminology is standard**: "Relative precision" or "relative uncertainty" is a well-established concept in metrology and measurement science, defined as the ratio of uncertainty to the measured value.

### Conclusion

The documentation correctly describes what the function should do (return relative precision), and the implementation correctly performs this calculation. However, the example in the docstring shows an incorrect output value that appears to be the absolute uncertainty instead of the relative precision. This is a clear documentation error where the example contradicts both the stated purpose and actual behavior of the function.
