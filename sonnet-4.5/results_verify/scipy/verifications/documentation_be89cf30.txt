## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

#### SciPy Documentation
From the scipy.signal.windows.tukey docstring and online documentation:

1. **Alpha Parameter Description**:
   - Defined as "Shape parameter of the Tukey window, representing the fraction of the window inside the cosine tapered region"
   - States: "If zero, the Tukey window is equivalent to a rectangular window"
   - States: "If one, the Tukey window is equivalent to a Hann window"

2. **Valid Range**:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly specify the valid range for alpha
   - It only gives special meaning to alpha=0 and alpha=1
   - No mention of handling for extremely small positive values
   - No warning about potential numerical issues with subnormal values

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The function should return a window with values between 0 and 1
   - The window should be normalized with maximum value of 1
   - No mention that NaN values are acceptable output

#### Mathematical Definition (Wikipedia)
The Tukey window is mathematically well-defined for all alpha in [0,1]:
- At alpha=0, it should be a rectangular window (all 1s)
- For 0 < alpha < 1, it creates a tapered cosine window
- At alpha=1, it becomes a Hann window

The mathematical formula shows that as alpha approaches 0 from above, the window should approach the rectangular window smoothly.

### Documentation Gaps
1. The documentation doesn't specify what happens with extremely small positive alpha values
2. No warning about numerical stability issues with subnormal floats
3. No explicit statement that alpha must be in [0, 1] range (though implied by the description)
4. No mention that the function might return NaN values under any circumstances

### Conclusion
Based on the documentation, a user would reasonably expect:
- Any alpha value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) should produce a valid window
- Very small positive alpha values should behave similarly to alpha=0
- The function should never return NaN values for valid inputs
- The window values should always be between 0 and 1
