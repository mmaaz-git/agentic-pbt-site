Bug Reproduction Report
=====================

The bug report claims that scipy.linalg.inv fails to detect singularity for matrices containing subnormal floating-point values, returning Inf values instead of raising LinAlgError.

## Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: CONFIRMED
   - The provided hypothesis test successfully reproduces the bug
   - When run with 1000 examples, it finds the failing case with the exact matrix reported:
     array([[2.22507386e-311, 2.22507386e-311],
            [2.22507386e-311, 2.22507386e-311]])
   - The test correctly identifies that inv() returns Inf values for this singular matrix

2. **Manual Reproduction**: CONFIRMED
   - The manual test case produces exactly the reported output:
     - Matrix rank: 1 (singular, as rank < 2)
     - Determinant: 0.0 (confirming singularity)
     - inv(A) returns: [[ inf -inf], [-inf  inf]]
   - No LinAlgError is raised despite the matrix being clearly singular

3. **Additional Testing**:
   - Tested with both check_finite=True and check_finite=False
   - Both cases produce the same result: Inf values without raising LinAlgError
   - The check_finite parameter does not affect the singularity detection

## Key Observations

The matrix in question contains subnormal values (2.22507386e-311), which are valid IEEE 754 floating-point numbers but extremely close to zero. These values are:
- Greater than 0 but less than the smallest normal positive float64 (~2.225e-308)
- Still valid floating-point representations

The bug is reproducible and matches the report exactly:
1. The matrix is provably singular (rank 1, determinant 0)
2. scipy.linalg.inv does NOT raise LinAlgError as documented
3. Instead, it returns a matrix containing infinity values

This is a clear violation of the documented behavior.
