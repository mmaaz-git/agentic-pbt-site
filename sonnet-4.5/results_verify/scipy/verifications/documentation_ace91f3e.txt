Documentation Analysis
=====================

1. scipy.io.matlab.savemat Documentation (from _mio.py lines 270-273):
   The docstring explicitly states:
   "Note that if this dict has a key starting with ``_`` or a sub-dict has a key starting with ``_`` or a digit, these key's items will not be saved in the mat file and `MatWriteWarning` will be issued."

   This documentation is CLEAR and EXPLICIT:
   - Variables starting with underscore should be ignored
   - Variables starting with digit should be ignored
   - Sub-dict keys starting with underscore or digit should be ignored
   - MatWriteWarning should be issued when ignoring

2. Implementation Analysis:
   - _mio5.py line 884: Only checks for underscore prefix (if name[0] == '_')
   - _mio4.py lines 631-632: No validation at all
   - _mio5.py line 486: Struct fields correctly check both underscore and digits

3. MATLAB Variable Naming Rules (from MATLAB documentation):
   - Variable names MUST start with a letter
   - Variable names CANNOT start with a digit
   - Examples of invalid names: 6x, 0test, 1var

   This is a fundamental MATLAB language restriction that scipy should respect.

4. Conclusion:
   The documentation is CORRECT and appropriate. The implementation is WRONG.
   This is not a documentation bug - the documentation accurately describes what the behavior SHOULD be.
   The code fails to implement the documented behavior.
