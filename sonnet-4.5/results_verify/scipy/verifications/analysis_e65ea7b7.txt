## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function has a `dtype` parameter that is completely ignored
- The parameter exists in the function signature but has no effect
- This is a clear violation of the principle of least surprise
- The fix is straightforward - replace DTYPE with dtype in 3 locations

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is an internal, private function (in _validation module)
- The function is not used anywhere in scipy codebase
- Not part of public API (not in __all__)
- No documentation specifies what dtype should do

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Function is internal/private (underscore prefix)
- Not documented or specified behavior
- Not used anywhere - may be dead code
- Users shouldn't be accessing private APIs

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function signature clearly includes a dtype parameter
- Even internal functions should work as their signatures suggest
- The parameter name "dtype" has a clear conventional meaning in NumPy/SciPy

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Function is unused in the entire scipy codebase
- Internal function not meant for public use
- No practical impact since nothing calls this function
- Could be considered dead code that should be removed entirely

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is trivial (3 line changes)
- Having broken internal functions is poor code hygiene
- Someone might use this in the future

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Adding dtype support could be seen as a new feature
- Function currently "works" with float64
- No specification that it should support other dtypes

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The parameter already exists - this isn't adding new functionality
- This is fixing existing broken functionality, not adding features

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that dtype parameter is ignored/deprecated
- Could document that function always returns float64

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is clearly a code bug, not a documentation issue
- The function has no public documentation to fix
- Internal functions don't typically have extensive documentation

### Conclusion
This appears to be dead code - an internal validation function that:
1. Is never called anywhere in scipy
2. Is not part of the public API
3. Has a broken dtype parameter that doesn't work

The most appropriate classification depends on scipy's policy for handling bugs in unused internal functions.
