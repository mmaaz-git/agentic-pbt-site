## Bug Reproduction Results

### Property-Based Test
I successfully ran the provided property-based test using Hypothesis. The test immediately failed with the following:
- Falsifying example: `x=array([0.])`
- Error: RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested
- The test found that DCT type 1 crashes on single-element arrays while attempting to perform a roundtrip DCT/IDCT operation.

### Specific Case Reproduction
I confirmed the bug with the specific example provided:
```python
x = np.array([1.0])
scipy.fft.dct(x, type=1)
```
Result: RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested

### Comparison Across DCT Types
I tested all four DCT types with a single-element array `[1.0]`:
- DCT Type 1: FAILS with "RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested"
- DCT Type 2: SUCCEEDS, returns `[2.]`
- DCT Type 3: SUCCEEDS, returns `[1.]`
- DCT Type 4: SUCCEEDS, returns `[1.41421356]`

### Additional Testing
I also verified that DCT Type 1 works correctly with 2 or more elements:
- Array `[1.0, 2.0]` with DCT Type 1: SUCCEEDS, returns `[3., -1.]`

### Effect Summary
The bug is confirmed. DCT Type 1 fails on single-element arrays with a misleading error message "zero-length FFT requested", while:
1. The input array has length 1, not 0
2. Other DCT types (2, 3, 4) handle single-element arrays correctly
3. The error message doesn't clearly indicate the actual issue (minimum array size requirement)
