## Documentation Analysis

### Official SciPy Documentation

1. **scipy.odr.unilinear Documentation**:
   - Clearly states the equation as: `y = β₀x + β₁`
   - Documentation describes it as "Univariate linear model"
   - Example provided shows usage with 2 parameters: beta = [1., 2.]
   - No indication that this is a single-parameter model

2. **Code Documentation** (from _models.py):
   - Class docstring: "Univariate linear model"
   - Equation in metadata: 'equ': 'y = B_0 * x + B_1'
   - TeX equation: '$y = \\beta_0 x + \\beta_1$'
   - All documentation consistently shows 2 parameters

### Mathematical Context

1. **Term "Unilinear"**:
   - Web searches did not find "unilinear" as a standard mathematical term
   - In dictionaries, "unilinear" means "developing in a single progressive sequence"
   - Not a standard term in linear algebra or regression literature

2. **"Univariate" vs "Unilinear"**:
   - The code actually labels it as "Univariate Linear" in the class name
   - "Univariate" typically means one independent variable (which this model has)
   - Does NOT imply single parameter

3. **Single Parameter Linear Models**:
   - Standard terminology would be "regression through the origin" for y = βx
   - One-parameter models are explicitly different from two-parameter models

### Documentation Consistency

The documentation is internally consistent:
- All sources (docstrings, metadata, online docs) agree: 2 parameters
- The name "unilinear" might be confusing, but it's actually documented as "univariate"
- No documentation suggests this should work with a single parameter

### Conclusion

The documentation correctly describes the actual behavior of the model. While the name "unilinear" might be misleading to some users who expect a single parameter model, the documentation clearly and consistently states that this is a two-parameter model with equation y = β₀x + β₁.
