TRIAGE ANALYSIS: scipy.special.inv_boxcox1p Bug Report
======================================================

Analyzing each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)
-----------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The function violates its documented mathematical definition
- Breaks the fundamental inverse property: inv_boxcox1p(boxcox1p(x, λ), λ) ≠ x for small λ
- Inconsistent behavior: works for λ=0 and λ>1e-200, fails for 0<λ<1e-200
- Clear implementation error: returns y instead of exp(y)-1 in small-λ case
- Mathematical discontinuity: the limit as λ→0 should equal the λ=0 case
- Reproducible with specific test cases
- Not an edge case - affects a whole range of valid lambda values
- Could impact real scientific computations using small lambda values

Arguments AGAINST:
- None. This is a clear bug in the implementation.

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
---------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- None. The bug is real and reproducible.

Arguments AGAINST:
- Test cases confirm the bug exists
- Mathematical analysis shows the function returns wrong values
- Documentation clearly states it should be an inverse operation
- The roundtrip property is explicitly shown in documentation examples

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
---------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Lambda values like 1e-264 are extremely small and rarely used in practice
- Most users would use lambda values in "normal" ranges
- Numerical precision at such extreme values might be considered unimportant

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is a mathematical function in a scientific library - correctness matters
- The fix is simple: use exp(y)-1 instead of returning y
- Users may encounter small lambda in optimization algorithms or limit calculations
- SciPy is used for serious scientific computation where accuracy is critical
- The function already handles λ=0 correctly, so small λ should work too
- Violates a fundamental mathematical property (inverse relationship)

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
--------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- None. The inverse operation is already documented as supported.

Arguments AGAINST:
- Documentation clearly states this IS supported functionality
- The function exists specifically to compute the inverse
- This isn't asking for new functionality, but fixing existing broken functionality

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
---------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could argue the documentation should warn about numerical issues with small λ

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation is correct about what the function SHOULD do
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Mathematical definition in docs is standard and correct
- Examples in documentation show the expected behavior (roundtrip property)

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT
------------------
- Impact: Medium to High (breaks fundamental mathematical property)
- Scope: Affects all lambda values below ~1e-200
- Fix difficulty: Low (appears to be simple logic error)
- User impact: Could cause silent errors in scientific computations

FINAL ASSESSMENT
---------------
This is clearly a BUG that should be filed and fixed:

1. It violates the documented mathematical definition
2. It breaks the inverse relationship that is the function's primary purpose
3. It's inconsistent (works for λ=0 but not small non-zero λ)
4. The error appears to be a simple implementation mistake
5. SciPy is a scientific library where mathematical correctness is paramount
6. The fix is straightforward: ensure the small-λ case computes exp(y)-1

The bug is neither trivial (WONTFIX) nor a documentation issue (DOCUMENTATION_FIX),
nor is it requesting new functionality (FEATURE_REQUEST) or based on incorrect
assumptions (INVALID). It's a legitimate implementation error that should be fixed.
