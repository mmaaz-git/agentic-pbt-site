Bug Reproduction Analysis

1. Code Inspection Results:
I inspected the actual source code of both functions and confirmed:
- fetch_data() in _fetchers.py line 34: Uses `headers={"User-Agent": f"SciPy {sys.modules['scipy'].__version__}"}`
- download_all() in _download_all.py line 54: Uses `headers={"User-Agent": "SciPy"}`

The bug report is technically correct - there IS an inconsistency in the User-Agent headers.

2. Hypothesis Test:
The provided hypothesis test checks if both functions include the version in their source code. The test:
- Checks for 'sys.modules['scipy'].__version__' in the source
- PASSES for fetch_data (version is included)
- FAILS for download_all (version is NOT included)

The test correctly identifies the inconsistency.

3. Technical Impact:
The claimed impacts are:
a) Server logs will show different User-Agents - TRUE, they will see "SciPy X.Y.Z" vs "SciPy"
b) Server admins cannot identify SciPy version for download_all - TRUE, no version is sent
c) Code lacks consistency - TRUE, both functions do the same thing but differently

4. Same GitHub Issue Reference:
Both files reference the same GitHub issue (#21879) on lines:
- _fetchers.py line 32
- _download_all.py line 53

This suggests they were both modified for the same reason (to add User-Agent headers to avoid 403 errors).

5. Functional Behavior:
Both functions will work correctly as-is. The difference in User-Agent headers does not affect functionality - both provide *some* User-Agent which prevents the 403 errors that issue #21879 was meant to fix.

Conclusion:
The technical details of the bug report are accurate. There IS an inconsistency between the two functions' User-Agent headers, even though both reference the same issue and were presumably updated for the same reason.
