TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

## Evaluation Against Each Category

### 1. INVALID
**Arguments Against:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The documentation clearly states "Value that denotes non-edges" without any mention of tolerance
- The behavior violates reasonable user expectations based on the API
- The function silently drops mathematically non-zero values
- Other similar parameters (infinity_null, nan_null) have explicit controls

**Arguments For:**
- None. The bug clearly exists and violates documented behavior.

**Verdict: NOT INVALID**

### 2. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Values like 1e-157 are extremely small and might be considered denormalized or near-zero
- Could argue these are "obscure error cases that would never happen in practice"
- Might be related to floating-point precision issues

**Arguments Against:**
- The threshold is at 1e-8, not at machine epsilon or denorm levels
- This affects normal scientific computation ranges (1e-10, 1e-9 are common in physics/chemistry)
- Silent data loss is a serious issue, not a trivial one
- The threshold is arbitrary and undocumented
- Users working with log-scale data or small probabilities may legitimately use such values

**Verdict: NOT WONTFIX - This is not trivial or obscure**

### 3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- If the threshold behavior is intentional for numerical stability, it should be documented
- Could add documentation explaining the threshold exists
- The code might be working as designed but poorly documented

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation explicitly says "Value that denotes non-edges" implying exact equality
- Adding documentation about a hidden threshold would be acknowledging a design flaw
- The API would be better served by adding a tolerance parameter if needed
- Silent data corruption is more than a documentation issue

**Verdict: POSSIBLE but not ideal - Better to fix the behavior**

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could frame as "Add support for exact null_value comparison"
- Could request a new `atol` parameter to control tolerance

**Arguments Against:**
- The current behavior is a deviation from documented behavior, not a missing feature
- Exact comparison is what users expect based on documentation
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

**Verdict: NOT A FEATURE_REQUEST - This is fixing a bug**

### 5. BUG
**Arguments For:**
- Silent data loss without warning or documentation
- Violates the documented behavior ("Value that denotes non-edges" implies exact equality)
- Breaks expected round-trip property
- Arbitrary undocumented threshold at ~1e-8
- No way for users to control or disable this behavior
- Inconsistent with how other null values (NaN, infinity) are handled with explicit parameters
- Could cause serious issues in scientific computing where small values are meaningful

**Arguments Against:**
- Could potentially be intentional for numerical stability (but then should be documented)

**Verdict: STRONG CASE FOR BUG**

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a BUG for the following reasons:

1. **Documentation Violation**: The documentation states null_value is "Value that denotes non-edges" with no mention of tolerance. Users reasonably expect exact comparison.

2. **Silent Data Corruption**: Values that are mathematically non-zero are being silently dropped without warning, which can lead to incorrect scientific results.

3. **Arbitrary Threshold**: The threshold of ~1e-8 is neither at machine epsilon (would be ~2.2e-16 for float64) nor documented. It appears arbitrary.

4. **No User Control**: Unlike NaN and infinity handling (which have explicit boolean parameters), users cannot control this threshold behavior.

5. **Broken Round-Trip**: The existence of both from_dense and to_dense functions implies they should be inverse operations, but this fails for small values.

6. **Legitimate Use Cases Affected**: Scientific computing often deals with values in the range 1e-10 to 1e-8 (e.g., physical constants, probabilities, concentrations).

While one could argue for DOCUMENTATION_FIX if the threshold is intentional for numerical stability, the better solution would be to:
- Remove the threshold for exact comparison, OR
- Add an optional `atol` parameter to control it, OR
- At minimum, document the threshold clearly

Since the current behavior contradicts documentation and causes data loss, this should be classified as BUG.
