BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

## Test Execution Summary

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are the detailed results:

## Test 1: Basic Reproduction
- Input: Variable name 'Ā' (U+0100) with a numpy array
- Result: UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode character '\u0100' in position 0
- This EXACTLY matches the error described in the bug report

## Test 2-3: Control Tests
- ASCII character 'A': SUCCESS (works as expected)
- Latin1 character 'ÿ' (U+00FF): SUCCESS (works as expected)
- These confirm that ASCII and latin1 characters work fine

## Test 4: Extended Unicode Tests
All characters outside the latin1 range (U+0000 to U+00FF) failed with UnicodeEncodeError:
- Ā (U+0100) - Latin Extended-A: FAILED
- 中 (U+4E2D) - Chinese: FAILED
- α (U+03B1) - Greek: FAILED
- π (U+03C0) - Greek: FAILED
- Д (U+0414) - Cyrillic: FAILED
- א (U+05D0) - Hebrew: FAILED
- あ (U+3042) - Japanese: FAILED

## Test 5: Property-Based Test
The Hypothesis test from the bug report also failed with UnicodeEncodeError, confirming the issue occurs for any Unicode character outside latin1.

## Error Analysis

The error occurs at exactly the point indicated in the bug report:
- File: scipy/io/matlab/_mio5.py
- Lines 896 and 901: `name.encode('latin1')`
- No try/except block to handle encoding errors
- No validation before attempting to encode

## Comparison with Underscore Handling

The code DOES properly handle underscore-prefixed names:
- Checks if name[0] == '_'
- Issues a clear warning message
- Skips the variable gracefully

But does NOT handle Unicode encoding issues:
- No check for latin1 compatibility
- No helpful error message
- Crashes with generic UnicodeEncodeError

## Conclusion

The bug is 100% reproducible and behaves exactly as described in the bug report. The error message is indeed unhelpful - it doesn't explain that MATLAB requires latin1-encodable variable names, leaving users confused about why their valid Python variable names don't work.
