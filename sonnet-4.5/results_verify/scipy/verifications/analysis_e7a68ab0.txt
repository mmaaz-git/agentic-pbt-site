## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The scipy documentation explicitly states that DCT Type 1 is "only supported for input size > 1". This is not hidden or ambiguous - it's clearly documented behavior. The bug report complains about behavior that is working exactly as documented. When a function behaves according to its documented constraints, reporting it as a bug is invalid. The user's expectation that all DCT types should handle single elements uniformly is not supported by the documentation.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The error message "zero-length FFT requested" is confusing since the input is not zero-length. Additionally, the inconsistency between DCT types could be seen as a usability issue. The property-based test reveals a legitimate expectation that mathematical properties should hold across all valid inputs, and if single elements aren't valid, perhaps a clearer error message would help.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Even if we consider this behavior suboptimal, the mathematical definition of DCT Type 1 may inherently require at least 2 elements due to its boundary conditions. The DCT-I is defined with specific symmetry requirements that may not be meaningful for a single element. Changing this would require significant rework of the mathematical implementation for an edge case that is already documented as unsupported.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistency between DCT types is notable - Types 2, 3, and 4 all handle single elements gracefully. This suggests it's technically possible to handle this case. The poor error message and the fact that it crashes rather than raising a more informative error could be worth fixing even if the constraint remains.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
While the documentation does state the size > 1 constraint, it could be clearer about what happens when you violate it. The documentation could explicitly state that a RuntimeError will be raised, or could better explain why DCT Type 1 has this limitation when other types don't. The error message itself could be considered part of the documentation that needs improvement.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation is already clear that DCT Type 1 requires size > 1. The constraint is explicitly stated, not ambiguous or hidden. The documentation's job is to specify constraints, not necessarily to detail every possible error condition. The current documentation is technically complete and accurate.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for DCT Type 1 to support single-element arrays, which it currently doesn't according to documentation. This would be a new feature - extending DCT Type 1 to handle a case it explicitly doesn't support. The request for consistent behavior across all DCT types could be seen as a feature enhancement for better API consistency.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report frames this as a bug/crash, not as a request for new functionality. The user believes this should already work and considers the current behavior broken. Feature requests are for new capabilities, not for fixing what users perceive as bugs. The mathematical definition of DCT-I may make this impossible rather than just unimplemented.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The error message "zero-length FFT requested" is misleading - the input array has one element, not zero. This could indicate an off-by-one error or other implementation bug. The RuntimeError might not be the intended way to handle this constraint. Even if single elements aren't supported, the code should fail more gracefully with a clear error message.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation explicitly states this constraint. The code is behaving exactly as documented - DCT Type 1 doesn't support single element arrays. A function operating within its documented constraints cannot be considered buggy just because the constraints exist. The crash is the expected behavior for unsupported input according to the documentation.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report describes behavior that is explicitly documented as a constraint of scipy's DCT Type 1 implementation. The official scipy documentation clearly states "Type I: Supported for input size > 1", which directly contradicts the bug report's claim that single-element arrays should be valid inputs. The reporter argues this is inconsistent with other DCT types, but each DCT type has its own mathematical definition and constraints - there is no documented requirement for uniform behavior across types.

The property-based test in the bug report makes an assumption that all DCT types should handle all array sizes uniformly, but this assumption is not supported by the documentation. The test is essentially checking for behavior that was never promised or specified. While it's true that Types 2, 3, and 4 handle single elements, Type 1's constraint is explicitly documented, making this expected behavior rather than a bug.

The most compelling aspect of the report is the poor error message - "zero-length FFT requested" is confusing when the input has one element. However, poor error messages alone typically don't constitute bugs when the constraint is documented. At best, this might warrant a DOCUMENTATION_FIX to improve the error message, but given that the constraint is already clearly documented and the error only occurs when violating documented constraints, even that seems unnecessary. This is clearly INVALID as the code behaves exactly as documented.
