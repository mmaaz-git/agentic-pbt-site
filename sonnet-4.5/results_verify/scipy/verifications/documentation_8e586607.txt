## Documentation Analysis

### Public API Documentation
- `download_all()` is documented in the public SciPy API documentation
- The documentation describes its purpose (downloading all dataset files) and parameters
- No mention of User-Agent headers or specific download implementation details
- No specification for what User-Agent format should be used

### Internal Function Documentation
- `fetch_data()` is an internal function (not in public API) with no docstring
- Used internally by public functions like ascent(), face(), and electrocardiogram()
- No documentation about User-Agent requirements

### GitHub Issue #21879
Both files reference this issue, which discusses:
- GitHub was blocking/rate-limiting requests without User-Agent headers
- ReadTheDocs and other services were getting 403 errors
- Solution was to add a User-Agent header to avoid being blocked
- No specific format for the User-Agent was mandated in the issue

### Key Findings
1. **No documented User-Agent specification**: Neither the public documentation nor the GitHub issue specifies what exact format the User-Agent should have

2. **Implementation detail**: The User-Agent header is an implementation detail not exposed in any public documentation

3. **Consistency not documented**: There's no documentation stating that these functions should or shouldn't use the same User-Agent format

4. **Purpose is clear**: The GitHub issue makes it clear that *some* User-Agent is needed to avoid being blocked, but doesn't specify consistency requirements

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify:
- What format the User-Agent should take
- Whether different functions should use the same User-Agent
- Whether including the version number is required or optional

This is purely an implementation consistency issue, not a violation of documented behavior.
