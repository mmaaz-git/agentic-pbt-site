Documentation Analysis for scipy.constants.find
================================================

After thorough examination of the documentation, here are my findings:

1. FUNCTION DOCSTRING (from source code):
   - States: "Return list of physical_constant keys containing a given string."
   - No mention that it only searches current CODATA constants
   - No disclaimer about searching only a subset of physical_constants
   - Examples show using find() results to access physical_constants, implying consistency

2. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION (docs.scipy.org):
   - Description: "Return list of physical_constant keys containing a given string."
   - Identical to the docstring
   - No clarification about the search scope
   - No mention of version limitations

3. IMPLIED CONTRACT:
   - The function name is find() with no qualifiers (not find_current() or find_2022())
   - The documentation explicitly mentions "physical_constant keys"
   - Users are shown examples of using find() results with physical_constants[]
   - The relationship between find() and physical_constants is presented as comprehensive

4. ACTUAL BEHAVIOR VS DOCUMENTATION:
   - Documentation says: searches "physical_constant keys"
   - Reality: searches only "_current_constants keys" (CODATA 2022)
   - This is a significant undocumented limitation

5. PHYSICAL_CONSTANTS DOCUMENTATION:
   - States it contains "2022 CODATA recommended values"
   - BUT the actual implementation includes constants from 2002-2022
   - Documentation doesn't clarify that older constants are preserved
   - No documentation about how name changes across CODATA versions are handled

6. KEY FINDING:
   The documentation creates a clear expectation that find() searches all keys in physical_constants. There is NO documentation suggesting it searches only a subset. The examples reinforce this expectation by showing find() used together with physical_constants lookups.

CONCLUSION: The documentation and actual behavior are inconsistent. The function does not fulfill its documented purpose of returning "list of physical_constant keys" - it returns only a subset.
