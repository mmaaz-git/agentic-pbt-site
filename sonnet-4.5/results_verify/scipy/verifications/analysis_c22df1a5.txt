## Triage Analysis for scipy.sparse.linalg.expm Bug Report

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against:**
- The bug report is factually correct - the documentation does state "Returns: ndarray" while the function returns a sparse array
- The test code runs correctly and demonstrates the issue
- There is a clear contradiction between documentation sections

**Arguments for:**
- None - this is not an invalid bug report

**Verdict:** NOT INVALID

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- This is primarily a documentation issue, not a functional bug
- The function works correctly and efficiently
- Users can easily convert sparse output to dense if needed

**Arguments against:**
- Documentation accuracy is important for API contracts
- This isn't an obscure edge case - it affects all sparse matrix inputs
- The inconsistency causes user confusion

**Verdict:** NOT WONTFIX - documentation should be accurate

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- The code behavior is reasonable and correct - preserving sparsity is a good design choice
- The implementation is working as intended by the developers
- The Examples section already shows the correct behavior
- The fix only requires updating the Returns section documentation
- No code changes are needed, just documentation clarity

**Arguments against:**
- One could argue the code should be changed to match documentation instead

**Verdict:** STRONG CANDIDATE for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Could be seen as requesting better documentation

**Arguments against:**
- This isn't asking for new functionality
- The issue is about existing behavior being misdocumented
- Not requesting a new feature, just accuracy in existing docs

**Verdict:** NOT a FEATURE_REQUEST

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for:**
- There is a clear mismatch between documented and actual behavior
- Users relying on the Returns specification will encounter unexpected types

**Arguments against:**
- The code is functioning correctly and efficiently
- The behavior (preserving sparsity) is sensible and intentional
- This is a documentation issue, not a code issue

**Verdict:** Could be considered a BUG, but more accurately a DOCUMENTATION_FIX

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a DOCUMENTATION_FIX issue. The code behaves sensibly by preserving the sparse format for efficiency with large sparse matrices. The Examples section even demonstrates this behavior correctly. The issue is solely that the Returns section incorrectly states "ndarray" when it should state "sparse array or ndarray" depending on input type. The proposed fix in the bug report is appropriate - update the documentation to accurately reflect the actual behavior.
