## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly specify that dataset validation must occur regardless of cache directory existence. The function's primary purpose is to clear cache, and if there's no cache directory, there's nothing to clear. One could argue that returning early when there's no work to do is a reasonable optimization, and the validation is only needed when actual work will be performed.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The behavior is clearly inconsistent - the same invalid input produces different results based on filesystem state. The function accepts a `datasets` parameter that should be validated regardless of whether the cache exists. The current behavior violates the principle of least surprise and makes the API unpredictable.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal function (prefixed with underscore) that's not part of the public API. The inconsistency only affects error cases with invalid inputs that users shouldn't be passing anyway. The public `clear_cache()` function only accepts actual dataset methods from scipy.datasets, making it unlikely that invalid callables would be passed in normal usage. The issue is extremely minor and fixing it provides minimal practical benefit.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even internal functions should have consistent behavior. The fix is simple and improves code quality. The function does perform validation in some cases, suggesting that validation is intended behavior. Inconsistent error handling can lead to confusion during debugging and testing.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify the validation behavior or order of operations. One could document that "validation only occurs when the cache directory exists" as the intended behavior. The current implementation might be considered correct, with the documentation needing clarification about when validation occurs.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The inconsistent behavior seems more like an implementation oversight than a documentation issue. The code clearly intends to validate inputs (lines 36-42), but the early return prevents this in some cases. Documenting this quirk would be documenting a bug rather than fixing the root cause.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding consistent validation could be viewed as a new feature - ensuring input validation regardless of filesystem state. The current code works for all valid inputs, and adding validation for invalid inputs in all cases could be considered an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The validation code already exists and runs in some cases. This isn't adding new functionality but fixing existing inconsistent behavior. The issue is about making existing validation work consistently, not adding new features.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function exhibits inconsistent behavior for the same invalid input based on unrelated filesystem state. This violates the principle of fail-fast and input validation best practices. The validation code exists but is bypassed due to an early return, suggesting an implementation oversight. The behavior makes testing and debugging more difficult as errors may be silently ignored in some environments.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function works correctly for all valid inputs. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise validation of invalid inputs. This is an internal function where such edge cases might be considered acceptable. The practical impact is minimal since users shouldn't be passing invalid datasets anyway.

## Overall Consideration

Looking at the evidence, this appears to be a minor implementation inconsistency in an internal function. The code clearly has validation logic for dataset methods (lines 36-42), but this validation is bypassed when the cache directory doesn't exist due to an early return. This creates unpredictable behavior where the same invalid input might raise an error or be silently ignored depending on filesystem state.

However, several factors suggest this is not a critical bug: (1) It's an internal function prefixed with underscore, not part of the public API; (2) The public wrapper function `clear_cache()` would typically only receive valid scipy dataset methods; (3) The issue only affects error cases with invalid inputs that shouldn't occur in normal usage; (4) The function still works correctly for all valid inputs.

The most appropriate categorization seems to be WONTFIX. While the inconsistency is technically incorrect, it's in an internal function, affects only invalid input cases, and has minimal practical impact. The effort to fix this minor edge case in internal code likely outweighs the benefit. This is the type of technical imperfection that exists in many codebases but doesn't warrant fixing unless it causes actual problems in practice.
