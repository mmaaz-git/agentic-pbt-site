## Documentation Analysis

I have reviewed both the source code documentation and the official SciPy documentation for the `step_factor` parameter.

### Documentation Found

From the source code (lines 109-114 of _differentiate.py):
```
step_factor : float, default: 2.0
    The factor by which the step size is *reduced* in each iteration; i.e.
    the step size in iteration 1 is ``initial_step/step_factor``. If
    ``step_factor < 1``, subsequent steps will be greater than the initial
    step; this may be useful if steps smaller than some threshold are
    undesirable (e.g. due to subtractive cancellation error).
```

From the input validation error message (line 27):
```
'Tolerances and step parameters must be non-negative scalars.'
```

### Key Observations

1. **No explicit constraint on step_factor=0**: The documentation does not explicitly state that `step_factor` cannot be 0. It only mentions:
   - Default value is 2.0
   - Values less than 1 result in increasing step sizes
   - The error message says "must be non-negative" which technically allows 0

2. **Mathematical interpretation**: The documentation describes `step_factor` as "the factor by which the step size is *reduced*". Mathematically:
   - `new_step = initial_step / step_factor`
   - When `step_factor=0`, this leads to division by zero
   - The documentation doesn't explicitly forbid this edge case

3. **Implementation details**: The algorithm uses `step_factor` as a base for exponential calculations:
   - `c**xp.arange(n)` where `c = step_factor`
   - When `c=0`, this produces `[1, 0, 0, ...]` leading to division by zero

4. **Inconsistency in validation**: The validation message says "non-negative" (allowing 0) but the actual usage requires a positive value to avoid division by zero.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not explicitly state that `step_factor` must be strictly positive (>0). It only implies non-negative (>=0) through the error message. This is a documentation gap that doesn't match the mathematical requirements of the algorithm. The function's mathematical operations require `step_factor > 0` to avoid division by zero, but this constraint is not documented or enforced in the input validation.
