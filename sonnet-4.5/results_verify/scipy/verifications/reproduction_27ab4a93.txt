## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Results
The provided Hypothesis test runs successfully and correctly identifies the issue. The test:
- Tests various integer values from -5 to 10 for both `init` and `so_init` parameters
- Correctly identifies which combinations are valid based on the `ip2arg` list
- Successfully detects when invalid values raise ValueError
- Confirms that the error message contains "[" and "not in list", which are unhelpful implementation details

### Simple Reproduction Results
Running the simple test case confirms the exact behavior described:

1. **Invalid value (init=3)**: Raises `ValueError: [3, 0] is not in list`
   - The error message is cryptic and exposes internal implementation details
   - It doesn't clearly indicate what the valid values should be

2. **Valid value (init=1)**: Works correctly with no error

3. **Multiple invalid values (init=5, so_init=10)**: Raises `ValueError: [5, 10] is not in list`
   - Again shows the same unhelpful error pattern

### Inconsistency with set_job()
I also tested the `set_job()` method as mentioned in the bug report:
- `set_job(fit_type=5)`: Does NOT raise an error (silently ignores/handles invalid value)
- `set_job(deriv=5)`: Does NOT raise an error (silently ignores/handles invalid value)
- The job value remains at its default (0) after setting invalid parameters

This confirms the inconsistency: `set_job()` silently handles invalid inputs while `set_iprint()` raises unhelpful errors.

### Actual Bug Behavior
The bug manifests exactly as described:
1. Invalid parameter values are accepted by the method signature
2. The error occurs during internal encoding when trying to find the parameter combination in a list
3. The error message "[X, Y] is not in list" exposes implementation details without explaining what went wrong
4. This is inconsistent with how similar methods handle invalid inputs
