BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report):
---------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Sparse matrices fundamentally should only store nonzero elements (well-established principle)
- The nnz attribute is misleading - it counts explicit zeros as nonzeros
- Performance and memory are unnecessarily degraded
- The fix is straightforward (call eliminate_zeros())
- Other sparse matrix operations likely don't create explicit zeros
- The behavior violates user expectations for sparse matrix operations

Arguments AGAINST:
- Documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee no explicit zeros
- eliminate_zeros() exists, suggesting explicit zeros are allowed temporarily

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report):
-------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise no explicit zeros
- The function technically works - it produces the correct mathematical result
- eliminate_zeros() method exists for users to clean up if needed

Arguments AGAINST:
- The fundamental principle of sparse matrices is violated
- nnz being incorrect is objectively wrong
- No reasonable user would expect explicit zeros in sparse matrices

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting):
------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Users can call eliminate_zeros() themselves after kron
- The mathematical result is correct even with explicit zeros
- Only affects memory/performance, not correctness

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not trivial - it affects core sparse matrix invariants
- Memory efficiency is a primary reason for using sparse matrices
- The fix is simple and should be done in the library

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported):
----------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could argue that "efficient kron without explicit zeros" is a new feature

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is about fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
- Sparse matrices storing only nonzeros is the expected default behavior

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error):
--------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could document that kron may create explicit zeros and users should call eliminate_zeros()

Arguments AGAINST:
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- Documenting a workaround doesn't fix the underlying issue

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This is a BUG. While the documentation doesn't explicitly guarantee no explicit zeros, the fundamental principle of sparse matrices is that they store only nonzero elements. The nnz attribute reporting incorrect counts is objectively wrong. The behavior violates reasonable user expectations and degrades the primary benefits of sparse matrices (memory efficiency). The fix is straightforward and should be implemented in the library rather than requiring all users to remember to call eliminate_zeros() after every kron operation.
