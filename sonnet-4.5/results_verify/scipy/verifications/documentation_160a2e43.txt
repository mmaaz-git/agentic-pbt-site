DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. Official Documentation:
The scipy.signal.windows.flattop documentation explicitly states in the Returns section:

"w : ndarray
    The window, with the maximum value normalized to 1"

This is an unambiguous contract that the maximum value of the returned window should be normalized to 1.0.

2. Documentation Source:
- Checked the official SciPy documentation at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.flattop.html
- Also verified in the source code docstring which contains the same statement

3. Additional Context:
The documentation does include a caveat: "(though the value 1 does not appear if M is even and sym is True)", but this caveat is about whether the exact value 1.0 appears in the array, not about values exceeding 1.0.

4. Purpose and Intent:
The documentation states that flat top windows are used for "taking accurate measurements of signal amplitude in the frequency domain". This use case suggests that normalization accuracy is important.

5. Referenced Literature:
The implementation references "Digital Signal Processing for Measurement Systems" by D'Antona and Ferrero (2006), which describes this as a 5th-order cosine window optimized for minimal scalloping error.

6. Conclusion:
The documentation clearly and explicitly promises that the maximum value is normalized to 1. There is no allowance or exception mentioned for values exceeding 1.0. The current implementation violates this documented contract by producing values of 1.000000003, even though the excess is extremely small (3e-09).
