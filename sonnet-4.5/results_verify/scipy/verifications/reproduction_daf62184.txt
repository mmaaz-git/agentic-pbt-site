REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   - The Hypothesis test as written does not fail with random exploration (500 examples)
   - However, when testing the specific failing case (n_points=13, seed=640), the bug occurs

2. SPECIFIC CASE REPRODUCTION:
   - With n_points=13 and seed=640, point 1 at coordinates [-1.10175507, 1.79793862] fails to be found
   - find_simplex(point_1) returns -1 with default tolerance
   - The point IS a vertex of the triangulation, appearing in simplices 0, 1, 17, and 18
   - The point is NOT in the coplanar list (meaning it was successfully included in the triangulation)

3. TOLERANCE TESTING:
   - Default tolerance (None) → returns -1 (FAILS)
   - 100*eps (2.22e-14) → returns -1 (FAILS)
   - 1e-14 → returns -1 (FAILS)
   - 1e-13 → returns 0 (WORKS)
   - 1e-12 and larger → returns 0 (WORKS)

4. VERIFICATION OF VERTEX STATUS:
   - Confirmed that point 1 is indeed a vertex in tri.points[1]
   - The coordinates match exactly: tri.points[1] == points[1]
   - Point 1 appears in 4 simplices: [0, 1, 17, 18]
   - The point is not in the coplanar list

CONCLUSION:
The bug is real and reproducible. A vertex of the Delaunay triangulation fails to be located by find_simplex() with the default tolerance setting. The function works correctly with a larger tolerance (≥1e-13).
