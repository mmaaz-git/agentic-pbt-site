Documentation Analysis
======================

## Official Documentation Review

I have reviewed the scipy documentation both in the source code and from the official website.

### From Source Code (scipy/io/matlab/_mio.py, lines 274-276):

The `savemat` function's docstring explicitly states:

```
appendmat : bool, optional
    True (the default) to append the .mat extension to the end of the
    given filename, if not already present.
```

### From Official SciPy Documentation:

The online documentation confirms the same behavior - when `appendmat=True` (which is the default), the function should automatically append '.mat' to the filename if it's not already present.

### Additional Documentation Context:

1. **Line 265-267**: States ".mat extension not needed if appendmat == True"
2. **Line 99-100 in loadmat**: Has identical documentation for appendmat parameter
3. **Line 301 in Example**: Shows `savemat("matlab_matrix.mat", mdic)` - notably using explicit .mat extension

## Documentation Clarity

The documentation is **crystal clear** about the expected behavior:
- When appendmat=True, the '.mat' extension should be automatically appended if not present
- This is the default behavior (appendmat defaults to True)
- Users should be able to call `savemat("myfile", data)` and get "myfile.mat"

## Consistency Check

The `loadmat` function has identical documentation for the appendmat parameter and it works correctly:
- `loadmat("test", appendmat=True)` correctly tries to load "test.mat"
- This establishes that the intended behavior is consistent across both functions

## Documentation vs Implementation

There is a clear mismatch:
- **Documentation says**: '.mat' will be appended when appendmat=True
- **Implementation does**: Does NOT append '.mat' for write operations

This is not a documentation error - the documentation correctly describes the intended behavior. The implementation is faulty.

## Conclusion

The documentation unambiguously specifies that appendmat=True should append the '.mat' extension. There are no caveats, exceptions, or ambiguities mentioned. The current implementation violates this documented contract.
