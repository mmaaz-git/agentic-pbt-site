## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise the composition property shift(shift(x,a),b) = shift(x,a+b). One could argue that without this explicit guarantee, the behavior isn't necessarily wrong. Additionally, the user might be misunderstanding how periodic shifts work with discrete Fourier transforms and Nyquist frequencies.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The mathematical formulation in the documentation (y_j = exp(j*a*2*pi/period*sqrt(-1)) * x_j) directly implies the composition property should hold. This is a fundamental mathematical property of phase shifts in Fourier space. The fact that it works for odd arrays but fails for even arrays suggests an implementation bug rather than intended behavior.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered an obscure edge case related to Nyquist frequency handling that rarely affects practical applications. The differences might be considered acceptable for most use cases. The fix might require significant changes to low-level Cython code that could introduce other issues or performance penalties.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The composition property is fundamental to shift operations and its violation could lead to incorrect results in scientific computations. The errors are substantial (up to 70% in simple cases), not minor numerical differences. This affects ALL even-length arrays, which is a common case, not an obscure edge condition.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to explicitly state that the composition property doesn't hold for even-length arrays due to Nyquist frequency handling. This would clarify the expected behavior and prevent user confusion. Other functions in the module document their Nyquist-related limitations.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The mathematical formula provided in the documentation inherently implies the composition property should work. Documenting this as expected behavior would be mathematically incorrect. The fact that odd arrays work correctly suggests this is a bug, not a documentation issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that proper composition support for even-length arrays is a new feature that wasn't originally implemented. The user is requesting behavior that, while mathematically correct, wasn't part of the original design specification.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The composition property is not a new feature but a fundamental mathematical requirement for shift operations. The function already works correctly for odd arrays, indicating the intended behavior. This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The composition property shift(shift(x,a),b) = shift(x,a+b) is a fundamental mathematical requirement that follows directly from the Fourier formulation provided in the documentation. The fact that it works for odd-length arrays but fails for even-length arrays indicates an implementation error. The errors are substantial (up to 70%) and affect all even-length arrays. The issue appears to be in the Nyquist frequency handling, specifically in how the convolution kernels are initialized.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise this property. The behavior might be intentional due to complexities in handling the Nyquist frequency for even-length arrays. Other functions in the module also have special Nyquist handling that could be considered expected behavior.

**Overall consideration**
This appears to be a genuine bug in the scipy.fftpack.shift implementation. The composition property is a fundamental mathematical requirement that follows directly from the Fourier coefficient formula provided in the documentation (y_j = exp(j*a*2*pi/period*sqrt(-1)) * x_j). When composing two shifts, we multiply by two exponentials which should combine into a single exponential with the sum of the phase shifts. This property is satisfied for odd-length arrays but fails for all even-length arrays, suggesting an implementation error rather than intended behavior.

The errors are substantial (up to 70% difference in simple 2-element arrays) and systematic, affecting every even-length array tested. This is not a numerical precision issue but a logical error in how the Nyquist frequency is handled during the convolution process. The implementation uses cos and sin kernels with the convolve module, and the zero_nyquist parameter appears to be incorrectly configured.

While the documentation could be clearer about composition properties, the mathematical formulation provided inherently implies this should work. The fact that other functions in the same module (diff, hilbert, etc.) explicitly document their Nyquist-related behaviors while shift does not suggests this was an oversight in implementation rather than intended behavior. This is a valid bug that affects the mathematical correctness of a fundamental operation in signal processing and should be fixed.
