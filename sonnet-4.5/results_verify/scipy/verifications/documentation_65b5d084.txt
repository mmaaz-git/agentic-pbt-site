Documentation Findings for scipy.io.arff DateAttribute
=======================================================

1. Official Documentation Status:
- The current official SciPy documentation for scipy.io.arff.loadarff explicitly states that "date type attributes" are NOT implemented functionality.
- However, examining the actual codebase shows that DateAttribute class does exist and is implemented in _arffread.py

2. DateAttribute Implementation Background:
- Date attribute support was added via GitHub PR #3641
- The implementation converts Java's SimpleDateFormat patterns to Python's datetime.strptime format
- Data is converted to numpy.datetime64 arrays
- The datetime unit is determined from the format string
- Requires numpy >= 1.7

3. Documentation Gap:
- There is NO official documentation for the DateAttribute class or its _get_date_format method
- The class appears to be an internal implementation detail not exposed in the public API
- No specification exists for how date format patterns should be parsed or what the expected behavior is

4. Format Pattern Specification:
- Based on the code, it attempts to convert Java SimpleDateFormat patterns:
  * yyyy -> %Y (4-digit year)
  * yy -> %y (2-digit year)
  * MM -> %m (month)
  * dd -> %d (day)
  * HH -> %H (hour)
  * mm -> %M (minute)
  * ss -> %S (second)
- The datetime_unit is set based on the finest granularity present in the pattern

5. Expected Behavior (Inferred from Code Intent):
- The _get_date_format method should parse ARFF date format strings
- It should convert Java date patterns to Python strptime patterns
- It should determine the appropriate numpy datetime unit based on the pattern components
- The datetime_unit should reflect the actual components present in the pattern

6. Key Finding:
The _get_date_format method is an internal implementation detail with no formal specification or documentation. Its behavior must be inferred from the code implementation itself. The method is not part of the public API.
