BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against the five possible categories:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
Arguments FOR:
- The function produces mathematically incorrect results for cumulative integration
- Negative cumulative values for non-negative functions violate fundamental mathematical properties
- Non-monotonic cumulative integrals for non-negative functions are mathematically impossible
- The function name "cumulative_simpson" strongly implies standard cumulative integration behavior
- Users would reasonably expect cumulative integrals to be causal (only using past data)
- The incorrect intermediate values could cause serious issues in scientific/engineering applications

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation accurately describes the algorithm being used
- The implementation correctly follows the referenced Cartwright paper
- The documentation acknowledges results differ from iterative Simpson calls

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
Arguments FOR:
- The implementation matches the documented algorithm exactly
- The documentation clearly states it uses "each point and two adjacent points"
- The reference paper describes this exact behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- The mathematical violations are real and demonstrable
- The function produces objectively incorrect results for cumulative integration
- Just because behavior is documented doesn't make it mathematically correct

3. WONTFIX (Trivial or unimportant)
Arguments FOR:
- The final integral value is correct, only intermediate values are wrong
- Users primarily care about the final result
- The algorithm provides "more accurate" estimates according to documentation

Arguments AGAINST:
- Intermediate values matter for many applications (monitoring convergence, partial integrals)
- Negative values for non-negative functions is a serious mathematical error
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects basic use cases

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for new functionality)
Arguments FOR:
- Could argue for a new "causal_cumulative_simpson" function that only uses past data
- The current function implements a specific algorithm from literature
- Adding causality would be a new feature, not fixing existing behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- The name "cumulative_simpson" inherently implies cumulative integration
- Users expect mathematical correctness, not a specific paper's algorithm
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation needs updating)
Arguments FOR:
- The documentation could be clearer about the non-causal nature
- Should explicitly warn about possible negative values for non-negative functions
- Should warn about non-monotonic behavior
- The function name is misleading given the actual behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- The mathematical errors are in the code, not just the documentation
- Simply documenting broken behavior doesn't make it acceptable
- Users need correct cumulative integration, not better warnings

FINAL ASSESSMENT:

This is a BUG. While the implementation matches its documentation, the function fundamentally violates mathematical properties of cumulative integration:

1. The function name "cumulative_simpson" creates a reasonable expectation of standard cumulative integration behavior
2. Producing negative cumulative integrals for non-negative functions is mathematically incorrect
3. Non-monotonic cumulative integrals violate fundamental properties
4. The use of future data points violates the causal nature of cumulative integration
5. These aren't edge cases - they affect basic usage with simple inputs

The fact that the algorithm comes from a published paper doesn't validate its use for general cumulative integration. The function should either:
a) Be fixed to compute mathematically correct cumulative integrals, OR
b) Be renamed to something that doesn't imply standard cumulative integration (e.g., "cartwright_simpson_interpolation")

This is a legitimate bug report about mathematically incorrect behavior that could cause serious issues in scientific computing applications.
