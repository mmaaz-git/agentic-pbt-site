## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report is CONFIRMED. The kmeans2 function with minit='random' crashes with LinAlgError when given data with duplicate rows or rank-deficient covariance matrices.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Basic Test Case**:
   - Input: 4x2 array with all rows identical [[1.0, 2.0], [1.0, 2.0], [1.0, 2.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
   - Result: CRASHES with "LinAlgError: Matrix is not positive definite"
   - This matches the reported behavior exactly.

2. **Hypothesis Property Test**:
   - The property-based test failed on the first example with n_obs=2, n_features=2
   - When creating rank-deficient data by tiling a single column, the 'random' initialization consistently fails
   - Error trace confirms the crash occurs at line 571 in _krandinit: `x = x @ xp.linalg.cholesky(_cov).T`

3. **Comparison with Other Initialization Methods**:
   - 'points' method: WORKS on the same duplicate data
   - '++' method: WORKS on the same duplicate data (though with warnings about empty clusters)
   - 'random' method: FAILS consistently with LinAlgError

### Root Cause Analysis
Examining the source code at scipy/cluster/vq.py lines 545-575:

The _krandinit function has three branches:
1. Lines 552-556: Handle 1D data
2. Lines 557-563: Handle rank-deficient case when data.shape[1] > data.shape[0] using SVD
3. Lines 564-571: Default case - computes covariance and uses Cholesky decomposition

The bug occurs in branch 3 (lines 564-571):
```python
_cov = xpx.atleast_nd(xpx.cov(data.T, xp=xp), ndim=2, xp=xp)
x = x @ xp.linalg.cholesky(_cov).T  # CRASHES HERE
```

When data has duplicate rows, the covariance matrix becomes singular (determinant = 0), which makes it not positive definite. Cholesky decomposition requires a positive definite matrix, hence the crash.

### Impact
This is a real bug that affects valid use cases:
- Duplicate data points are common in real datasets
- Other initialization methods handle this case properly
- The code already has logic to handle rank-deficient cases (SVD approach), but only applies it when columns > rows

The crash prevents users from using kmeans2 with 'random' initialization on datasets that may contain duplicate observations, which is a significant limitation.
