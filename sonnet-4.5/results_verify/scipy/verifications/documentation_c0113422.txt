Documentation Analysis
======================

Documentation Review:
--------------------
1. ODR class documentation (scipy.odr.ODR):
   - States job is "an integer telling ODRPACK what tasks to perform"
   - References page 31 of the ODRPACK User's Guide for details
   - Recommends using set_job() method for more readable interface
   - DOES NOT specify valid job values directly
   - DOES NOT warn about potential crashes or incompatibilities

2. set_job() method documentation:
   - Clearly documents fit_type parameter with values:
     * 0 -> explicit ODR
     * 1 -> implicit ODR
     * 2 -> ordinary least-squares
   - Notes that "permissible values are different from those given on pg. 31 of the ODRPACK User's Guide"
   - DOES NOT mention that implicit ODR requires implicit models
   - DOES NOT warn about crashes when using explicit models with implicit ODR

3. Model class documentation:
   - Models have an 'implicit' attribute (0 for explicit, 1 for implicit)
   - unilinear is documented as a univariate linear model
   - unilinear.implicit = 0 (it's an explicit model)
   - NO documentation warns about mixing explicit models with implicit ODR fitting

4. ODRPACK User's Guide:
   - Could not directly access page 31 due to PDF processing issues
   - The scipy documentation references it but doesn't reproduce critical safety information

Documentation Gaps:
-------------------
1. No warning that job=1 (implicit ODR) requires implicit models
2. No documentation about what happens when mixing explicit models with implicit fitting
3. No input validation documented for preventing incompatible combinations
4. The critical safety information from ODRPACK guide is not reproduced in scipy docs

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation is INCOMPLETE regarding safety constraints. It does not warn users that:
- Using job=1 (implicit ODR) with explicit models will crash
- There are compatibility requirements between model types and fit types
- Some job values can cause segmentation faults with certain models

This is a documentation issue AND a code issue - the code should validate inputs to prevent
crashes, and the documentation should clearly state the constraints.
