## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Results:

1. **Direct Test with var_name='0':**
   - Result: FAILED - Variable '0' WAS saved to the file
   - Expected: Variable should NOT be saved per documentation

2. **Multiple Digit-Starting Names Test:**
   All variables with digit-starting names were saved successfully:
   - '0': SAVED (found in file)
   - '1': SAVED (found in file)
   - '2': SAVED (found in file)
   - '9': SAVED (found in file)
   - '5test': SAVED (found in file)
   - '9abc': SAVED (found in file)

3. **Warnings Test:**
   - For digit-starting names: 0 warnings issued
   - Expected per documentation: MatWriteWarning should be issued

4. **Comparison with Underscore Behavior:**
   - Variable '_private': NOT saved (as documented)
   - Warning issued: "Starting field name with a underscore (_private) is ignored"
   - This shows the underscore filtering IS working as documented

### Reproduction Summary:

The bug report is technically correct. The code demonstrates that:

1. Variables with names starting with digits ('0', '9abc', etc.) ARE saved to the .mat file
2. NO warnings are issued for digit-starting variable names
3. The documentation explicitly states these should NOT be saved and should issue warnings
4. The underscore prefix filtering works correctly, proving the mechanism exists but isn't applied to digits

The actual output matches exactly what the bug report claims:
- All digit-prefixed variables are saved
- No warnings are issued
- This contradicts the documented behavior
