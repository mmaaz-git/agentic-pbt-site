TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluation of bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Function crashes with LinAlgError on valid input data (5x5 matrix)
   - Other initialization methods (points, ++) work fine with same data
   - No documentation mentions this limitation
   - The fix is simple and mathematically sound
   - Square matrices are common in real-world data (e.g., correlation matrices)
   - The code already has robust handling for n_features > n_obs, just missing n_features == n_obs case
   - This is clearly an oversight in the conditional logic (> vs >=)

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - None identified

2. INVALID (Incorrect bug report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - None - the bug is reproducible and real

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Bug reproduces exactly as described
   - Technical analysis confirms the root cause
   - The proposed fix addresses the actual problem

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue square matrices are uncommon in clustering
   - Users could work around by using minit='points' or minit='++'

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Not trivial - causes complete function failure
   - Square matrices do occur in practice
   - Inconsistent behavior between initialization methods is confusing
   - Fix is simple and improves robustness

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue supporting square matrices is a "new feature"

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Function already accepts square matrices with other minit options
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
   - K-means inherently supports any data shape

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could document that minit='random' doesn't work with square matrices

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The code is broken, not the documentation
   - Other minit methods work fine, so documenting a limitation would be inconsistent
   - Better to fix the code than document a limitation

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:
- When n_obs == n_features, the sample covariance matrix has at most rank (n_obs - 1)
- For n=5, max rank is 4, making the 5x5 covariance matrix rank-deficient
- Cholesky decomposition requires positive definite (full rank) matrices
- SVD-based approach already used for n_features > n_obs handles rank deficiency correctly
- The same SVD approach works perfectly for n_features == n_obs

CONCLUSION:
This is a clear BUG. The function fails on valid input due to an off-by-one logic error in handling matrix dimensions. The existing code already has the correct solution (SVD-based initialization) but fails to apply it to the square matrix case. The fix is trivial (changing > to >=) and mathematically correct.
