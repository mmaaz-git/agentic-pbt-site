DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR scipy.signal.resample
=================================================

Official Documentation Review:
------------------------------
The official scipy.signal.resample documentation specifies:

1. Function purpose: "Resample x to num samples using the Fourier method along the given axis"

2. Input requirements:
   - x: "The input signal made up of equidistant samples"
   - num: "The number of samples of the resampled output signal"

3. Implementation details:
   - "The resampling is performed by shortening or zero-padding the FFT of x"
   - "The main drawback is the requirement of assuming x to be a periodic signal"
   - Uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) internally

4. Edge cases and error handling:
   - The documentation does NOT specify what happens with empty arrays
   - The documentation does NOT list any specific exceptions that may be raised
   - The documentation does NOT mention any minimum input size requirements

5. Key observations:
   - The function fundamentally relies on FFT operations
   - FFT inherently requires non-empty data to compute frequency components
   - The concept of resampling an empty signal is mathematically undefined in the Fourier domain
   - There is no documented behavior for edge cases like empty inputs

6. Comparison with other scipy.signal functions:
   - Other functions show varied behavior with empty arrays:
     * resample_poly: Returns empty array (handles gracefully)
     * fftconvolve: Returns empty array (handles gracefully)
     * medfilt: Returns empty array with warning (handles gracefully)
     * convolve/correlate: Raise ValueError with reduction operation error
     * hilbert: Raises ValueError "N must be positive"
     * filtfilt/decimate: Raise ValueError about padlen requirements
   - There is inconsistent handling of empty arrays across the module

7. Mathematical context:
   - Resampling involves converting a signal to the frequency domain via FFT
   - An empty signal has no frequency components to analyze
   - The mathematical operation of resampling empty data is undefined
   - Unlike simple operations (like convolution with empty), resampling requires actual data points

Conclusion on documentation:
The documentation does not specify behavior for empty array inputs. This is neither explicitly supported nor explicitly forbidden. The error occurs deep in the FFT implementation rather than at the API boundary of resample itself.
