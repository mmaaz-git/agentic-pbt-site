DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## RotationSpline Documentation Review

The official SciPy documentation for RotationSpline was reviewed at:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.RotationSpline.html

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **No Explicit Statement About Keyframe Evaluation**:
   - The documentation does not explicitly state what should happen when evaluating the spline at exact keyframe times
   - However, it shows examples of interpolation at both keyframe and intermediate times

2. **Interpolation Method Described**:
   - States it performs "cubic spline interpolation that minimizes torque"
   - Guarantees "continuous angular rate and acceleration"
   - References it as "analogous to cubic spline interpolation"

3. **No Special Boundary Conditions Documented**:
   - No mention of special handling for first or last keyframes
   - No warnings about numerical issues at boundaries

## General Spline Interpolation Principles

From Wikipedia and general mathematical literature on spline interpolation:

1. **Fundamental Property**: Splines MUST pass through their control points (knots)
   - This is explicitly stated: "q_i(x_i) = y_i" - the polynomial at each knot must equal the corresponding value
   - The article states splines minimize bending "under the constraint of passing through all knots"

2. **This is Not Just Convention**:
   - It's a defining mathematical property of interpolating splines
   - Distinguished from approximating splines which may not pass through control points

## SciPy Interpolation Standards

Review of SciPy's general interpolation documentation shows:
- Most interpolation methods (CubicSpline, PchipInterpolator, etc.) are designed to pass exactly through data points
- Methods are labeled as "interpolator" (passes through points) vs "approximator" (may not)
- RotationSpline is presented as an interpolator, not an approximator

## Conclusion

The documentation strongly implies, through both naming conventions and analogy to cubic splines, that RotationSpline should pass exactly through keyframe rotations when evaluated at keyframe times. While not explicitly stated for RotationSpline, this is:
1. A fundamental mathematical property of interpolating splines
2. The standard behavior of SciPy's other interpolation functions
3. Implied by calling it "cubic spline interpolation"
