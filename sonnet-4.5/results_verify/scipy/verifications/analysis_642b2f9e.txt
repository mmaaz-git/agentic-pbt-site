CATEGORIZATION ANALYSIS

Let me consider each possible categorization for this bug report:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect):

   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation never promises that ihilbert(hilbert(x)) == x for all x
   - The documentation only guarantees hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x when sum(x) == 0
   - The Nyquist zeroing behavior is explicitly documented: "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero"
   - The functions work as documented, not as the bug reporter assumes

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The function name "ihilbert" (inverse hilbert) strongly implies it should be an inverse
   - The mathematical formulas suggest they should be inverses (y_j formulas are conjugates)
   - Users reasonably expect inverse operations to round-trip

2. WONTFIX (Trivial or uninteresting):

   Arguments FOR:
   - This is specialized FFT functionality for periodic sequences
   - The behavior has been this way for a long time
   - Changing it would break backward compatibility

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is not a trivial issue - it affects core mathematical properties
   - The inability to round-trip data is a significant limitation
   - This is not an obscure edge case but affects all even-length arrays

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong/unclear):

   Arguments FOR:
   - The term "inverse Hilbert transform" is misleading if it's not a true inverse
   - The documentation should clearly state that ihilbert(hilbert(x)) != x in general
   - The limitations of the inverse relationship need better explanation
   - Users are confused by the current documentation (as evidenced by this bug report)

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation does state the key limitations (Nyquist zeroing, conditional inverse)
   - The mathematical formulas are accurate

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Add new functionality):

   Arguments FOR:
   - Could add new functions that provide true inverse behavior
   - Could add a parameter to control Nyquist handling
   - The current behavior could be preserved while adding new options

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The bug report claims the current behavior is wrong, not requesting new features
   - This would be changing existing functions, not adding new ones

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):

   Arguments FOR:
   - The function names strongly imply inverse relationship
   - Mathematical analysis shows they should be inverses if implemented correctly
   - The zeroing of Nyquist seems arbitrary and breaks mathematical properties
   - Common user expectation is that inverse operations should round-trip

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation explicitly states the Nyquist zeroing behavior
   - The documentation never promises general inverse property
   - The functions work exactly as documented

DETAILED ASSESSMENT:

The core issue is a mismatch between:
1. User expectations (based on function names and mathematical theory)
2. Actual implementation (which zeros certain frequency components)
3. Documentation (which mentions the limitations but perhaps not prominently enough)

The fact that the documentation explicitly states "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero"
is crucial. This is not an undocumented behavior or implementation bug - it's an intentional design choice
that's documented.

However, calling a function "inverse Hilbert transform" when it doesn't actually invert the Hilbert
transform in the general case is misleading. The documentation could be much clearer about this limitation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is best categorized as DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The functions work as documented, but the documentation
is misleading about the inverse relationship. The documentation should:
1. Clearly state that ihilbert is NOT a general inverse of hilbert
2. Explain when round-tripping works and when it doesn't
3. Consider renaming or clarifying what "inverse" means in this context
