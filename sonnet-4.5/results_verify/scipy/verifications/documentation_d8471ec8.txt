DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR scipy.integrate.cumulative_simpson
==============================================================

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FOUND:
The function cumulative_simpson was added in SciPy 1.12.0 and is documented at:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.cumulative_simpson.html

KEY DOCUMENTATION POINTS:

1. Function Purpose:
   - "Cumulatively integrate y(x) using the composite Simpson's 1/3 rule"
   - "The integral of the samples at every point is calculated by assuming a quadratic relationship between each point and the two adjacent points"

2. Mathematical Foundation:
   - Uses composite Simpson's 1/3 rule
   - Assumes quadratic relationship over three consecutive points
   - References Cartwright's paper on Simpson's Rule Cumulative Integration
   - Claims to be "exact for polynomials of order 3 or less with even number of subintervals"

3. Behavioral Notes:
   - Falls back to cumulative_trapezoid for 2 or fewer points
   - The documentation explicitly states: "The output of cumulative_simpson is similar to that of iteratively calling simpson with successively higher upper limits of integration, but not identical"
   - Documentation notes it can "typically produce more accurate estimates" because it has "access to more information than simpson"

4. What the Documentation DOES NOT Specify:
   - No explicit guarantee about monotonicity for non-negative functions
   - No mention that cumulative integrals of non-negative functions must be non-decreasing
   - No warning about potential negative values in cumulative results for non-negative inputs
   - No specification about how the "quadratic relationship" handles edge cases

5. Mathematical Properties from External Sources:
   - Simpson's rule Wikipedia page does not discuss cumulative integration or monotonicity
   - The fundamental theorem of calculus guarantees that the cumulative integral of a non-negative function must be non-decreasing (this is a mathematical fact, not a documentation requirement)

6. Implementation Details from Source Code:
   - Uses asymmetric formulas from Cartwright's paper (equation 8)
   - Alternates between "h1" and "h2" interval calculations
   - The formula includes negative terms that can produce negative sub-integrals even for non-negative data

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly promise monotonicity for non-negative functions. However, this is a fundamental mathematical property that any cumulative integral should satisfy. The documentation does not warn users that this property might be violated.
