BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating bug report for scipy.optimize.cython_optimize._zeros.loop_example

Consideration for BUG (VALID):
-------------------------------
STRONG EVIDENCE:
1. Mathematical correctness violation: Returns xa as "root" when f(xa) = 1.0 â‰  0
2. Inconsistent behavior: Python versions raise ValueError, Cython doesn't
3. Silent data corruption: No error indication when returning invalid results
4. Internal inconsistency: full_output_example correctly sets error_num=-1, but loop_example ignores it
5. Fundamental API contract violation: Root-finding requires f(a)*f(b) < 0 for bracketing methods
6. The underlying C code already detects the error but the wrapper doesn't handle it

This appears to be a clear BUG - the function should check error_num and raise appropriate exceptions.

Consideration for INVALID:
--------------------------
WEAK EVIDENCE:
1. The loop_example docstring doesn't explicitly promise to raise errors
2. It's an example function that might have different error handling expectations
3. The function is in a private module (_zeros) suggesting internal use

COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
- Even example functions should follow mathematical correctness
- The function is accessible and usable by users
- Returning incorrect results is worse than any documentation ambiguity

Consideration for WONTFIX:
--------------------------
WEAK EVIDENCE:
1. The function might be considered internal/example code only
2. Users could check full_output_example for error status if needed
3. The underscore prefix suggests private implementation

COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
- The function is exposed in the public API (importable)
- Silent failures are dangerous regardless of internal status
- The fix is straightforward (check error_num and raise)

Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
-----------------------------------
WEAK EVIDENCE:
1. Could argue that error checking is a "new feature" for this function
2. The current behavior might be intentional for performance

COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
- This is not a new feature but a bug fix for incorrect behavior
- Performance impact of checking error_num is negligible
- Correctness should override minor performance considerations

Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
-------------------------------------
WEAK EVIDENCE:
1. The docstring could be updated to warn about no error checking
2. Could document that users must validate inputs themselves

COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
- This would legitimize incorrect mathematical behavior
- Documentation can't fix the fact that invalid results are returned
- The code behavior is objectively wrong, not just poorly documented

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
-----------------
This is clearly a BUG. The function:

1. Violates mathematical correctness by returning non-roots
2. Behaves inconsistently with the Python API
3. Ignores error detection already present in the underlying code
4. Causes silent data corruption without warning
5. Affects all four root-finding methods

The severity is HIGH because:
- Silent failures in numerical computing can propagate errors
- Users expect consistency between Python and Cython versions
- The fix is straightforward but the impact of not fixing is significant

The bug report is well-documented, reproducible, and identifies a genuine defect in the code that should be fixed.
