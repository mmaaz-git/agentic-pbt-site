BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report for scipy.signal.deconvolve against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
----------------------------------------------
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- The function explicitly violates its documented mathematical property
- The docstring states: "signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder"
- This property fails for the given inputs with a 6.7% error
- The inputs are valid floating-point numbers within reasonable ranges
- No warnings or errors are raised despite the property violation
- The numerical instability (quotient values reaching 5.72e+14) causes the failure
- The function silently returns incorrect results

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- Numerical instability is a known challenge in signal processing
- The divisor [0.125, 0.0, 2.0] represents an unstable filter
- Some might argue this is inherent to the mathematical problem

VERDICT: STRONG case for BUG - The function makes an unconditional mathematical guarantee
that it fails to satisfy, with no warnings or documentation of limitations.

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
---------------------------------
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- None - the bug is clearly reproducible and the property violation is confirmed

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- The reproduction clearly shows the documented property is violated
- The test case uses valid inputs
- The mathematical relationship claimed by the documentation fails

VERDICT: NOT INVALID - The bug report is accurate and well-documented.

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
-----------------------------------
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- Numerical instability with certain divisors might be considered edge case
- The specific divisor pattern might be considered unusual
- Fixing might require significant algorithm changes

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- 6.7% error is significant, not a minor floating-point rounding issue
- The failure occurs with moderate-length signals (23 elements)
- The function makes an explicit mathematical guarantee that it violates
- Silent failures can lead to incorrect scientific/engineering results

VERDICT: NOT WONTFIX - This is a significant correctness issue, not a trivial edge case.

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality)
---------------------------------------
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- Adding numerical stability checking could be seen as a new feature
- Warning users about unstable divisors could be an enhancement

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- The function already claims to satisfy a mathematical property
- This is about fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new features
- The documented behavior should work as stated

VERDICT: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST - This is about fixing broken existing functionality.

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Docs are wrong)
--------------------------------------
ARGUMENTS FOR:
- One could argue the documentation should warn about numerical instability
- The mathematical property could be qualified with "for numerically stable divisors"
- Could add warnings about limitations with certain divisor patterns

ARGUMENTS AGAINST:
- The code is genuinely failing to meet its specification
- Simply documenting the failure doesn't fix the underlying problem
- Users expect the stated mathematical property to hold
- Other signal processing libraries handle similar cases better

VERDICT: POSSIBLE but SUBOPTIMAL - While updating docs to warn about limitations
would be better than nothing, the actual behavior violates a fundamental property.

FINAL ASSESSMENT
================

This is clearly a BUG that should be fixed. The function makes an explicit,
unconditional mathematical claim in its documentation that it violates in practice.
The failure is significant (6.7% error) and occurs silently with no warnings.

The best resolution would be to:
1. Fix the numerical instability (using regularization or more stable algorithms)
2. Add runtime checks to warn when the property is violated
3. Document any remaining limitations

Simply changing the documentation to say "this might not work sometimes" would be
a poor solution for a scientific computing library where correctness is critical.

The bug report is well-written, provides clear reproduction, and identifies a genuine
violation of the function's documented contract. This should be filed as a BUG.
