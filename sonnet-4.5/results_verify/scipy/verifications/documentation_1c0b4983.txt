## Documentation Analysis for scipy.ndimage.shift

### Official Documentation Findings

The official SciPy documentation for scipy.ndimage.shift states:

1. **Function Purpose**: Shifts an array using spline interpolation of the requested order.

2. **Mode Parameter**: The 'wrap' mode is described as: "The input is extended by wrapping around to the opposite edge, but in a way such that the last point and initial point exactly overlap."

3. **Critical Note About wrap Mode**: The documentation explicitly states: "In this case it is not well defined which sample will be chosen at the point of overlap."

4. **Order Parameter**: The order parameter controls spline interpolation order (0-5, default 3). Order=0 means nearest-neighbor interpolation.

### Additional Documentation from SciPy Issues and Updates

From web searches and SciPy documentation history:

1. **Known Issues with wrap Mode**: There is a documented issue (#2640) in SciPy's GitHub where the wrap mode has unexpected behavior. The traditional 'wrap' mode creates ambiguity because it treats the period for n samples as n-1, with the first and last sample overlapping.

2. **Introduction of grid-wrap Mode**: In SciPy 1.6, a new mode called 'grid-wrap' was introduced specifically to address the issues with the traditional 'wrap' mode. The 'grid-wrap' mode uses a grid interpretation where all n samples are replicated without overlap.

3. **Documentation Recommendations**: More recent documentation suggests using 'grid-wrap' instead of 'wrap' for true periodic boundary conditions.

### Key Documentation Insights

1. **No Promise of Invertibility**: The documentation does NOT promise that shift operations with mode='wrap' will be invertible. There is no mention of round-trip guarantees.

2. **Explicit Ambiguity**: The documentation explicitly acknowledges ambiguity in the 'wrap' mode at the overlapping boundary points.

3. **Alternative Available**: The documentation provides 'grid-wrap' as an alternative that handles periodic boundaries correctly.

4. **Historical Context**: The 'wrap' mode behavior is a known issue that has been documented in GitHub issues and addressed through the introduction of 'grid-wrap' mode.

### Conclusion from Documentation

The documentation clearly indicates that 'wrap' mode has ambiguous behavior at boundaries and does not guarantee invertibility. The introduction of 'grid-wrap' mode as an alternative suggests that the 'wrap' mode behavior is considered a design limitation rather than a bug, and users expecting true periodic boundaries should use 'grid-wrap' instead.
