BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

Evaluating the bug report against five possible categorizations:

1. INVALID - The report is incorrect
   STRONG EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Cannot reproduce the claimed behavior
   - All tests show function_calls correctly includes initial evaluations
   - The hypothesis test provided actually PASSES (no assertion error)
   - The example output in the report (showing 6 calls with duplicates) doesn't match reality
   - Documentation says "Number of times the function was called" with no exclusions

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - None found

2. WONTFIX - Bug exists but is trivial/uninteresting
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could argue counting is an implementation detail

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - No actual bug found to classify as WONTFIX
   - The current behavior is correct and documented

3. FEATURE_REQUEST - Asking for unsupported functionality
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could interpret as request for separate tracking of initial vs iteration calls

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - Report claims existing behavior is wrong, not requesting new feature
   - Current behavior matches documentation

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Documentation needs clarification
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - Could add explicit note that initial bracket checks are included

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - Documentation already says "Number of times the function was called"
   - Current behavior matches reasonable interpretation of docs
   - No real ambiguity that needs fixing

5. BUG - Valid bug that should be fixed
   EVIDENCE FOR:
   - None - cannot reproduce the claimed issue

   EVIDENCE AGAINST:
   - Extensive testing shows the methods work correctly
   - function_calls accurately reports all evaluations
   - Documentation supports current behavior

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

The bug report makes several factual errors:
1. Claims the methods "under-report by 2" - Testing shows exact match
2. Shows example with 6 calls including duplicates - Actual behavior shows 4 unique calls
3. Claims initial f(a), f(b) aren't counted - They clearly are counted

The hypothesis test provided in the report:
- Pre-evaluates f(a) and f(b) to check bracketing
- Resets counter before calling bisect
- Expects bisect's count to match actual calls AFTER reset
- This test PASSES because bisect correctly counts its own f(a), f(b) calls

The report fundamentally misunderstands the behavior. The methods DO count all their
function evaluations, including the necessary initial bracket verification.

RECOMMENDATION: INVALID

This is clearly an invalid bug report based on incorrect assumptions about the
implementation. The current behavior is correct, well-documented, and consistent
across all bracketing methods.
