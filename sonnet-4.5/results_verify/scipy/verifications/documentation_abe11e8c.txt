DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have reviewed the official scipy.fft.dct documentation and related mathematical references:

1. SCIPY OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION (scipy.fft.dct):
   - EXPLICIT CONSTRAINT: The documentation states "DCT-I is only supported for input size > 1"
   - This confirms that size-1 inputs are not supported for DCT Type I
   - The restriction is documented, but the error message doesn't reflect this

2. MATHEMATICAL FORMULA:
   From the scipy documentation, the DCT-I formula is:
   y_k = x_0 + (-1)^k x_{N-1} + 2 âˆ‘_{n=1}^{N-2} x_n cos(Ï€kn / (N-1))

   The critical issue: The formula contains division by (N-1) in the cosine term
   - When N=1, this results in division by zero
   - This makes DCT Type I mathematically undefined for N=1

3. WIKIPEDIA CONFIRMATION:
   - States explicitly: "DCT-I is not defined for N less than 2"
   - Confirms that all other DCT types are defined for any positive N
   - This explains why DCT types 2, 3, and 4 work with size-1 arrays

4. ERROR MESSAGE DOCUMENTATION:
   - The documentation does NOT specify what error message should appear
   - It only states the constraint that input size must be > 1
   - There's no mention of "zero-length FFT" error anywhere

5. ASSESSMENT OF BUG REPORT CLAIMS:
   - The mathematical constraint is real and documented
   - The function correctly rejects N=1 inputs
   - However, the error message is misleading and doesn't match the documentation

CONCLUSION:
The documentation confirms that DCT Type I should reject size-1 inputs, which the implementation does correctly. However, the error message "zero-length FFT requested" is not documented and is misleading. The documentation would support a clearer error message that directly states the size > 1 requirement.
