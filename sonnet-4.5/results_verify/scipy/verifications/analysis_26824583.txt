## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The code comment at line 870 explicitly states "No error should happen here: it is a bug otherwise"
- The error type (ValueError) doesn't match documented exceptions (ParseArffError/NotImplementedError)
- The ARFF specification suggests attributes should be uniquely named

**Arguments for INVALID:**
- None. The bug clearly exists and violates the code's own expectations.

### Considering WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Duplicate attribute names might be considered an obscure edge case
- Users shouldn't create ARFF files with duplicate attribute names

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- The error message is confusing and comes from NumPy internals rather than scipy
- The code comment acknowledges this is a bug
- Easy to fix with simple validation
- Better error messages improve user experience

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly say duplicate attributes are invalid
- Could document that ValueError may be raised for duplicate attributes

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code comment clearly indicates this is a bug, not expected behavior
- The current error is from NumPy internals, not scipy's intended error handling
- Documenting a bug doesn't fix the underlying issue

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Could be seen as requesting better error handling

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This isn't a new feature - it's fixing broken error handling
- The code comment acknowledges this is a bug
- The function should already raise ParseArffError for invalid ARFF files

### Considering BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
1. The code comment at line 870 explicitly states any error here is a bug
2. Wrong exception type: ValueError instead of ParseArffError
3. Error comes from NumPy internals, not scipy's validation
4. No early validation of duplicate attribute names during header parsing
5. Confusing error message that doesn't help users understand the problem
6. The ARFF specification implies attributes should be unique
7. Easy to fix with proper validation in the header parsing phase

**Arguments against BUG:**
- None significant. This is clearly a bug.

### Conclusion
This is unequivocally a BUG. The code's own comment admits that errors at this point are bugs, and the current behavior violates the expected error handling model where ParseArffError should be raised for invalid ARFF files. The fix is straightforward: validate attribute name uniqueness during header parsing and raise ParseArffError with a clear message.
