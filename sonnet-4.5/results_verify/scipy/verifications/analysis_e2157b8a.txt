## Triage Analysis for scipy.signal.deconvolve Bug Report

### Consideration for BUG
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. The function violates its explicitly documented mathematical property: `signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder`
2. The error magnitude (451.0) is far beyond acceptable numerical precision - this is not a rounding error
3. The documentation makes no mention of numerical limitations or conditions where the property might not hold
4. The function is failing on valid numerical inputs (no NaN, Inf, or extreme values beyond 1e6)
5. The property is fundamental to what deconvolution means mathematically - it's not an optional feature
6. The issue appears consistently reproducible with certain input patterns (large coefficient ratios)

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- (No strong arguments against this being a bug)

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. The inputs that cause failures involve extreme coefficient ratios (1.25:79299 â‰ˆ 1:63000)
2. Could be argued that such extreme ratios are uncommon in practice

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
1. The inputs are not pathological - they're reasonable floating-point numbers within [-1e6, 1e6]
2. Scientific computing often involves wide dynamic ranges
3. The error is not a minor precision issue but a fundamental failure of the algorithm
4. No documentation warns users about these limitations

### Consideration for INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. Could argue that numerical methods inherently have limitations

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
1. The documentation explicitly promises this mathematical property without qualifications
2. The test inputs are well within reasonable bounds
3. The error is not due to user misuse but algorithm failure
4. Other implementations (like numpy.polydiv referenced in the docs) might handle these cases correctly

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code's numerical instability could be considered "expected" for filter-based methods
2. Documentation could be updated to warn about numerical limitations

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The mathematical property is fundamental to deconvolution - weakening it would make the function's purpose unclear
2. The error magnitude suggests a fixable implementation issue, not an inherent limitation
3. Better algorithms exist (as the bug report suggests) that could maintain the property

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could frame numerical stability as an enhancement rather than a bug

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. The function already claims to provide this functionality
2. This is about fixing existing broken behavior, not adding new capabilities
3. The mathematical property is already documented as working

### Final Analysis
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function fails to deliver on its core documented promise - that `signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder`. The documentation makes this claim without any caveats about numerical stability, input ranges, or coefficient ratios. The errors observed (451.0) are not minor numerical precision issues but represent fundamental algorithm failure. The implementation uses `lfilter` which is known to be numerically unstable for certain inputs, and better approaches exist (as suggested in the bug report). Users have every right to expect the documented mathematical property to hold within reasonable numerical tolerances.
