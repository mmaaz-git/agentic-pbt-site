Documentation Analysis for scipy.fftpack.hilbert and scipy.fftpack.ihilbert
=============================================================================

The official documentation for scipy.fftpack.hilbert clearly states in its Notes section:

"If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x."

This is an unconditional statement that claims the round-trip property (applying hilbert then ihilbert) will return the original input whenever the sum of the input is zero. There are no qualifiers or conditions mentioned regarding the length of the array.

Additionally, the documentation also states:

"For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero."

This second statement explains a specific behavior for even-length arrays where the Nyquist frequency component is set to zero. However, this statement is presented separately and does not explicitly connect to or qualify the round-trip property claim.

The documentation for ihilbert describes it as the "inverse Hilbert transform" with the mathematical relationship:
- For hilbert: y_j = sqrt(-1)*sign(j) * x_j, y_0 = 0
- For ihilbert: y_j = -sqrt(-1)*sign(j) * x_j, y_0 = 0

These mathematical definitions suggest that ihilbert should indeed be the inverse of hilbert.

Key finding: The documentation makes an unqualified claim that hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x when sum(x) == 0, without mentioning that this property only holds for odd-length arrays. The fact that the Nyquist mode is zeroed for even-length arrays is mentioned but not connected to the failure of the round-trip property.
