## Bug Reproduction Report

### Bug Summary
The bug report claims that line 276 in scipy.io.arff._arffread.DateAttribute._get_date_format has a logic error where `elif "yy":` is used instead of `elif "yy" in pattern:`.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Verified the source code**:
   - Located the file at `/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/scipy_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/io/arff/_arffread.py`
   - Confirmed that line 276 indeed contains `elif "yy":` instead of `elif "yy" in pattern:`
   - This is a clear logic error as the string "yy" always evaluates to True

2. **Ran the simple reproduction case**:
   ```python
   from scipy.io.arff._arffread import DateAttribute
   pattern, unit = DateAttribute._get_date_format("date 'just text'")
   print(f'Pattern: {pattern}, Unit: {unit}')
   ```

   **Result**: `Pattern: just text, Unit: Y`

   **Expected**: Should raise ValueError because the pattern contains no date/time components

3. **Ran the Hypothesis property-based test**:
   - Created a test that generates random text without any date/time components (no yyyy, yy, MM, dd, HH, ss)
   - The test expects ValueError to be raised for such inputs
   - The test failed on multiple inputs, confirming the bug
   - Example failing inputs: "date 0", "date 'just text'", and many random strings

### Bug Effect

The bug causes the following incorrect behavior:
1. When a date pattern contains no "yyyy" string (checked at line 273), execution falls through to line 276
2. The condition `elif "yy":` always evaluates to True (non-empty string literal)
3. This causes the code to always set `datetime_unit = "Y"` even when "yy" is not in the pattern
4. As a result, patterns with no date components incorrectly return with `datetime_unit="Y"` instead of raising ValueError

The bug allows invalid date patterns to be accepted when they should be rejected. This violates the function's contract, as evidenced by lines 298-299 which are supposed to raise ValueError when no valid datetime_unit is set.
