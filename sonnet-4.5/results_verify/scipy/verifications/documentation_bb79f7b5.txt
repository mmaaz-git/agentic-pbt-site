Documentation Analysis for User-Agent Inconsistency
===================================================

## Documentation Sources Reviewed

1. **SciPy datasets documentation** (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/datasets.html)
   - No specifications about User-Agent headers
   - No requirements for HTTP headers
   - No consistency requirements between download functions
   - Only mentions that scipy uses Pooch library for downloads

2. **Pooch HTTPDownloader documentation** (https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/api/generated/pooch.HTTPDownloader.html)
   - No guidance about User-Agent headers
   - No best practices about version numbers in User-Agent strings
   - Documentation focuses on authentication and basic HTTP functionality

3. **GitHub Issue #21879** (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/21879)
   - Issue was about 403 Forbidden errors from GitHub
   - User-Agent was added to avoid being blocked as potential bot traffic
   - No discussion about whether to include version numbers
   - No specification about consistency between functions
   - The fix was simply to add "a User-Agent" to avoid rate limiting

4. **RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics)**
   - Defines User-Agent conceptually but provides no format requirements
   - Does not mandate version numbers in User-Agent strings
   - Does not specify consistency requirements
   - Only notes that servers might use User-Agent for implementation detection

## Key Findings

1. **No documented requirements**: There are NO documented requirements or specifications about:
   - Whether User-Agent headers should include version numbers
   - Whether different download functions should use consistent User-Agent strings
   - What format the User-Agent should follow

2. **Implementation detail**: The User-Agent header appears to be an implementation detail added to solve a practical problem (GitHub rate limiting), not a documented API contract

3. **No user-facing documentation**: The User-Agent header is not mentioned in any user-facing documentation, suggesting it's an internal implementation detail

## Conclusion

The documentation does not specify any requirements for User-Agent consistency or format. This appears to be an undocumented implementation detail where two functions happened to implement the same solution (adding a User-Agent header to avoid rate limiting) in slightly different ways.
