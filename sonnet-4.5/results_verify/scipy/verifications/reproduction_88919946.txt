REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR REPORTED BUG
======================================

TEST SETUP:
-----------
I ran the exact code provided in the bug report to verify the claimed behavior.

REPRODUCTION RESULTS:
---------------------

1. SINGLE-ELEMENT ARRAY WITH DCT TYPE 1:
   Input: np.array([1.])
   Result: RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested
   Status: CONFIRMED - The error occurs exactly as reported

2. SINGLE-ELEMENT ARRAY WITH OTHER DCT TYPES:
   - Type 2: SUCCESS - Returns [2.] (without norm) or [1.] (with norm='ortho')
   - Type 3: SUCCESS - Returns [1.]
   - Type 4: SUCCESS - Returns [1.41421356] (without norm) or [1.] (with norm='ortho')
   Status: CONFIRMED - Types 2, 3, and 4 handle single-element arrays without error

3. PROPERTY-BASED TEST:
   The hypothesis test fails immediately when it generates a single-element array with type=1
   Error: RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested
   Status: CONFIRMED - The property test fails as reported

4. TWO-ELEMENT ARRAY TEST:
   Tested np.array([1., 2.]) with all DCT types
   All types (1, 2, 3, 4) work successfully with 2-element arrays
   Status: CONFIRMED - Type 1 works fine with arrays of length â‰¥ 2

TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
-------------------
The bug report is technically accurate in its observations:
- DCT Type 1 does crash with single-element arrays
- DCT Types 2, 3, and 4 do work with single-element arrays
- The error message is indeed "RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested"
- The behavior is inconsistent between Type 1 and other types

COMPARISON WITH DOCUMENTATION:
------------------------------
The scipy documentation explicitly states that DCT Type I is "Only supported for input size > 1"
This means the observed behavior is DOCUMENTED and EXPECTED, not a bug.

The error occurs because:
- DCT Type I mathematically requires at least 2 points due to its boundary conditions
- The implementation correctly enforces this requirement
- The documentation correctly describes this limitation

CONCLUSION:
-----------
While the bug report's technical observations are accurate, the behavior is explicitly documented
and therefore not a bug. The RuntimeError for single-element arrays with DCT Type 1 is the
expected and documented behavior of the function.
