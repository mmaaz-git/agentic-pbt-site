## Documentation Analysis for scipy.signal.deconvolve

### Documentation Sources Reviewed

1. **Source Code Docstring** (in _signaltools.py):
   - States: "Deconvolves ``divisor`` out of ``signal`` using inverse filtering"
   - Promise: "Returns the quotient and remainder such that ``signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder``"
   - Parameters described as simple (N,) array_like with no constraints mentioned
   - No warnings or notes about divisor[0] needing to be non-zero
   - No mention of any limitations on the divisor array

2. **Official scipy.org Documentation**:
   - Accessed via WebFetch
   - Same content as docstring
   - No mention of constraints on divisor[0]
   - No warnings about leading zeros
   - Example provided uses divisor=[2, 1] which has non-zero first element

### Critical Documentation Gaps

1. **No Constraint Documentation**: The documentation makes NO mention that divisor[0] must be non-zero. This is a critical constraint that users cannot anticipate.

2. **Mathematical Promise**: The documentation promises to return values such that "signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder", which is a mathematically well-defined operation even when divisor[0] == 0.

3. **Implementation Detail Hidden**: The fact that deconvolve internally uses lfilter (which has the a[0] != 0 requirement) is an implementation detail that should not affect the documented API contract.

4. **No Workaround Suggested**: The documentation provides no guidance on how to handle cases where divisor[0] == 0, even though mathematically valid deconvolutions exist for such cases.

### Comparison with Related Functions

- numpy.polydiv is mentioned as a related function that "performs polynomial division (same operation, but also accepts poly1d objects)"
- numpy.polydiv DOES handle leading zeros correctly, making the limitation in scipy.signal.deconvolve even more unexpected

### Documentation Assessment

The documentation is **incomplete and misleading** because:

1. It fails to document a critical constraint (divisor[0] != 0)
2. It promises a mathematical relationship that should be achievable even with divisor[0] == 0
3. Users have no way to anticipate this limitation from reading the documentation
4. The error message itself admits it's a "BUG" rather than intentional behavior

This is either:
- A BUG (the function should handle divisor[0] == 0)
- A DOCUMENTATION_FIX (the limitation should be clearly documented if intentional)
