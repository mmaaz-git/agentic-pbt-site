BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

1. BUG REPORT CLAIM:
The bug report claims that _clear_cache fails to validate input arguments when the
cache directory doesn't exist, accepting invalid inputs without raising an error.

2. REPRODUCTION RESULTS:

Test 1 - Basic Reproduction (CONFIRMED):
- Created non-existent cache directory path
- Passed invalid string "invalid_string" to _clear_cache
- Result: NO EXCEPTION RAISED - function returned silently
- Expected: AssertionError from line 36 assert callable(dataset)

Test 2 - Multiple Invalid Input Types (ALL CONFIRMED):
When cache directory does NOT exist:
- String "invalid": No exception raised (BUG CONFIRMED)
- Integer 123: No exception raised (BUG CONFIRMED)
- Float 45.6: No exception raised (BUG CONFIRMED)
- Dict {"key": "value"}: No exception raised (BUG CONFIRMED)

Test 3 - Behavior with EXISTING Cache Directory:
When cache directory EXISTS:
- String "invalid": AssertionError raised (CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
- Integer 123: AssertionError raised (CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
- Float 45.6: AssertionError raised (CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
- Dict {"key": "value"}: AssertionError raised (CORRECT BEHAVIOR)

Test 4 - Hypothesis Test:
The property-based test from the bug report failed as expected, confirming that
the function does not raise exceptions for invalid inputs when cache doesn't exist.

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

The bug is exactly as described in the report:
- Line 24-26 in _utils.py checks if cache directory exists
- If it doesn't exist, the function prints a message and returns early
- This early return happens BEFORE the validation on line 36
- The assert callable(dataset) validation is never reached

Code flow when cache doesn't exist:
1. Lines 24-26: Check cache existence -> returns if not exists
2. Line 36: assert callable(dataset) -> NEVER REACHED

Code flow when cache exists:
1. Lines 24-26: Check passes (cache exists)
2. Line 36: assert callable(dataset) -> VALIDATES INPUT

4. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:

The bug report's technical details are 100% accurate:
- The line numbers referenced are correct
- The code behavior matches the description
- The reproduction code works as stated
- The root cause analysis is correct

5. IMPACT:

This is a genuine inconsistency in input validation. The function behaves
differently based on cache directory state, which violates the principle that
input validation should be consistent regardless of system state. Invalid inputs
should always be rejected, not silently accepted based on cache existence.
