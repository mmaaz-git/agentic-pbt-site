## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function works correctly when using filenames directly, so one could argue that the file handle path is somehow being misused. Perhaps the user is not properly managing file handles or there's something about how temporary files work that makes this invalid usage.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states that mminfo accepts "str or file-like" objects as input, with examples showing file-like object usage. The crash is a segmentation fault, not a Python exception, which is never acceptable behavior for a Python library regardless of input. The usage pattern in the bug report is completely normal and expected.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
One could argue that since there's a workaround (using filenames instead of file handles), and since the crash only occurs with file handles, maintainers might consider this low priority. The C++ implementation is complex and fixing memory management issues might be considered too risky for the benefit.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is a complete process crash (segfault) in a core functionality that's explicitly documented as supported. File-like object support is a key feature for many workflows including testing, streaming, and in-memory operations. A segfault is a critical failure that cannot be caught or handled, making it impossible for users to work around programmatically.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the C++ implementation genuinely cannot support repeated calls with file handles due to design limitations, the documentation could be updated to warn users about this limitation. The docs could specify that file handles should not be used in loops or that only filename strings are fully supported.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation currently promises file-like object support without caveats, and changing this would be a breaking change to the API contract. A segfault is not a documentation issue - it's a implementation bug. The feature worked before the C++ rewrite in version 1.12.0, so this is a regression, not a design limitation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could frame "make mminfo work with file handles in loops" as a new feature request if the current implementation was never designed to support this use case. Perhaps robust file handle support could be considered an enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
File-like object support is already a documented, existing feature - not something new being requested. The code accepts file handles and works on the first call, showing the feature exists. A segfault when using an existing feature is a bug, not a missing feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a textbook bug - the function crashes the Python interpreter with a segmentation fault when used in a documented, supported way. The crash is 100% reproducible, occurs in normal usage patterns, violates the API contract, and represents a regression from previous versions. Segfaults are never acceptable in Python libraries.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
There are essentially no valid arguments against this being a bug. The only possible argument would be if the documentation explicitly warned against this usage, which it does not.

## Overall Consideration

This bug report describes a clear, severe, and reproducible crash in scipy.io.mminfo when called multiple times with file-like objects. The investigation confirms that the function causes a segmentation fault (core dump) on the second call when using file handles, while working correctly with filename strings.

The crash represents a critical failure in basic memory management within the C++ implementation introduced in scipy 1.12.0. Segmentation faults are never acceptable behavior in Python libraries - they bypass Python's exception handling system and terminate the entire process. This makes it impossible for users to handle the error gracefully or implement workarounds in their code.

The documentation explicitly supports file-like objects as input without any warnings or limitations about repeated calls. The examples in the documentation even demonstrate using StringIO objects, reinforcing that file-like object support is a core feature. Users have every right to expect that calling mminfo multiple times with file handles should work correctly, especially since this is a common pattern in data processing pipelines and testing frameworks. This is unequivocally a BUG that should be filed and fixed.
