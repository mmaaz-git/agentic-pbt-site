## Documentation Analysis for scipy.odr.polynomial Pickle Issue

### SciPy ODR Documentation Findings

1. **scipy.odr.polynomial documentation**:
   - The official documentation describes polynomial as a "Factory function for a general polynomial model"
   - Returns a "Model instance" for polynomial regression
   - No mention of pickling capability or restrictions
   - No warnings about serialization limitations

2. **scipy.odr.Model documentation**:
   - Documentation does not address pickling or serialization at all
   - No warnings about Model instances that cannot be pickled
   - No specification that Model objects should or should not be pickleable

3. **scipy.odr module overview**:
   - Lists predefined models: polynomial, exponential, multilinear, unilinear, quadratic
   - No documentation distinguishing polynomial from other models in terms of pickling capability
   - No warnings that polynomial behaves differently from other predefined models

### Python Pickle Documentation

The Python pickle documentation explicitly states:
- Functions can be pickled only if they are "accessible from the top level of a module"
- Local functions and nested functions CANNOT be pickled
- Attempts to pickle unpicklable objects will raise PicklingError

### Key Documentation Gap

The scipy.odr documentation does not specify:
1. Whether Model objects are expected to be pickleable
2. That polynomial() models have different pickling behavior than other predefined models
3. Any warnings about serialization limitations for polynomial models

### Conclusion from Documentation

Based on the documentation review:
- There is no explicit promise that scipy.odr models should be pickleable
- However, there is also no warning that polynomial models cannot be pickled while others can
- The inconsistency between polynomial and other predefined models is undocumented
- Users would reasonably expect all predefined models to behave consistently
