## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in scipy.io.arff.loadarff() when handling ARFF files with duplicate attribute names.

### Test Results

1. **Property-Based Test**: The Hypothesis test confirmed that when duplicate attribute names are present (e.g., two attributes both named 'a'), the function crashes with a ValueError.

2. **Direct Reproduction**: Running the exact example from the bug report:
   - Input: ARFF file with two attributes both named 'width'
   - Result: ValueError: field 'width' occurs more than once
   - Traceback shows the error occurs at line 871 in _arffread.py

### Key Observations

1. The error occurs at line 871 in _arffread.py when trying to create a NumPy array:
   ```python
   data = np.array(a, [(a.name, a.dtype) for a in attr])
   ```

2. Line 870 has a comment that explicitly states:
   ```python
   # No error should happen here: it is a bug otherwise
   ```

3. The error is a ValueError from NumPy's internals, not a ParseArffError from scipy's ARFF parser.

4. The duplicate attribute names are not validated during the header parsing phase, which allows the invalid data structure to propagate to the NumPy array creation step.

### Conclusion

The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The function crashes with a confusing ValueError when it encounters duplicate attribute names, instead of raising a clear ParseArffError during header validation as would be expected.
