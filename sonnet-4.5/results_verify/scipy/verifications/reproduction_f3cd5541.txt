## Bug Reproduction Results

### Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

The bug report is technically accurate in its description of the problem.

### Test Results

1. **Exact Failing Case (M=2, alpha=2.225073858507e-311)**:
   - Result: [0. nan]
   - Contains NaN: True
   - The bug reproduces exactly as reported

2. **Threshold Analysis**:
   - alpha=1e-100: Works correctly, returns [0. 1.]
   - alpha=1e-200: Works correctly, returns [0. 1.]
   - alpha=1e-300: Works correctly, returns [0. 1.]
   - alpha=1e-305: Works correctly, returns [0. 1.]
   - alpha=1e-308: FAILS with NaN, returns [0. nan]
   - alpha=1e-310: FAILS with NaN, returns [0. nan]
   - alpha=1e-311: FAILS with NaN, returns [0. nan]
   - alpha=1e-312: FAILS with NaN, returns [0. nan]

   The threshold appears to be around 1e-308, which corresponds to the minimum normalized double-precision float value (approximately 2.2e-308).

3. **Root Cause Verification**:
   - For alpha=1e-300: -2.0/alpha = -2e+300 (large but finite), cos(π*value) = valid number
   - For alpha=1e-308: -2.0/alpha = -inf (overflow), cos(π*(-inf)) = NaN
   - For alpha=1e-310: -2.0/alpha = -inf (overflow), cos(π*(-inf)) = NaN

   The issue is confirmed to be division overflow when computing -2.0/alpha for very small alpha values.

4. **Hypothesis Test**:
   - The property-based test fails with the exact reported input
   - The assertion that all values should be finite is violated

5. **Edge Case Behavior**:
   - alpha=0.0 correctly returns [1. 1.] (rectangular window)
   - alpha=1.0 correctly returns [0. 0.] (Hann window, matching scipy's hann function)
   - alpha=1e-320 (smaller than float64 minimum) also produces NaN in the last element

6. **Error Messages**:
   - scipy generates RuntimeWarning for "overflow encountered in divide"
   - scipy generates RuntimeWarning for "invalid value encountered in add"
   - These warnings confirm the overflow issue in the division operation

### Technical Analysis

The bug occurs at line 946 of _windows.py:
```python
w3 = 0.5 * (1 + xp.cos(xp.pi * (-2.0/alpha + 1 + 2.0*n3/alpha/(M-1))))
```

When alpha < ~2.2e-308 (the minimum normalized float64 value), the expression `-2.0/alpha` overflows to negative infinity, and `cos(-inf)` returns NaN. This NaN propagates through the calculation, resulting in NaN values in the output window.

The issue affects the third segment of the Tukey window calculation (the right taper), which is why we see [0. nan] for M=2 - the first value is from segment 1 (correctly computed as 0), and the second value is from segment 3 (incorrectly computed as NaN).
