## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG Classification

**Arguments for BUG:**
1. **Documentation Violation**: The functions are explicitly documented as inverses of each other without any caveats or limitations. The implementation fails to maintain this documented property.

2. **Asymmetric Behavior**: The round-trip works perfectly for large negative values (tested up to -100) but fails for positive values starting at xâ‰ˆ20. This asymmetry proves the issue is not a fundamental floating-point limitation but an implementation defect.

3. **Fixable Problem**: The root cause analysis demonstrates that using a numerically stable formula (exp(-x)/(1+exp(-x)) instead of 1-p) completely eliminates the error. This shows the problem has a known solution.

4. **Practical Impact**: Values like x=20 are well within normal usage ranges for logistic functions in machine learning and statistics. This is not an obscure edge case.

5. **Progressive Degradation**: The error grows from acceptable (1e-13 at x=10) to catastrophic (infinity at x=40), indicating a numerical instability that compounds.

6. **Mathematical Correctness**: Mathematically, logit(expit(x)) = x should hold exactly for all real x. The implementation should strive to maintain this within floating-point precision limits.

### Consideration for WONTFIX Classification

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
1. This is not an obscure edge case - x=20 is a reasonable value in practical applications
2. The asymmetry (works for negative, fails for positive) indicates this is fixable, not inherent
3. The error magnitude (3.59e-08 at x=20, infinity at x=40) is too large to ignore
4. Users explicitly rely on the inverse relationship per the documentation

**Verdict**: Not WONTFIX - the issue is significant and fixable.

### Consideration for INVALID Classification

**Arguments against INVALID:**
1. The documentation explicitly states these are inverse functions
2. No documentation mentions precision limitations or range restrictions
3. The test expectations are reasonable (rtol=1e-9 is not overly strict)
4. The asymmetric behavior proves this isn't just floating-point roundoff

**Verdict**: Not INVALID - the bug report correctly identifies a real issue.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX Classification

**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. One could argue the documentation should mention numerical precision limitations
2. The examples use small values, potentially misleading users about the effective range

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The fact that it works perfectly for large negative values proves the limitation is not inherent
2. The issue is clearly an implementation bug (catastrophic cancellation) with a known fix
3. Documenting a fixable limitation instead of fixing it would be the wrong approach
4. Other numerical libraries handle similar computations correctly

**Verdict**: Not DOCUMENTATION_FIX - this is an implementation issue that should be fixed, not documented away.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST Classification

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. This is not requesting new functionality but expecting documented behavior to work
2. The inverse relationship is already claimed to exist by the documentation
3. Numerical stability is a bug fix, not a feature enhancement

**Verdict**: Not FEATURE_REQUEST - maintaining documented mathematical properties is not a new feature.

### Final Analysis

This is a clear case of a **BUG**:

1. The implementation violates explicitly documented behavior (inverse relationship)
2. The issue occurs at reasonable input values (x=20), not extreme edge cases
3. The asymmetric behavior (works for negative, fails for positive) proves it's an implementation defect
4. The root cause (catastrophic cancellation) is well-understood with known solutions
5. The impact is significant - errors range from 3.59e-08 to infinity
6. Users reasonably expect the documented inverse property to hold within floating-point precision

The bug report is well-written, technically accurate, and identifies a genuine numerical stability issue that should be fixed in the implementation rather than documented as a limitation.
