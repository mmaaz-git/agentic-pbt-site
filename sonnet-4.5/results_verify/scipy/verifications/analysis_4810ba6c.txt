## Triage Analysis

### Considering INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- None applicable. The documentation clearly specifies accepted types, and the code violates this specification.

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The documentation explicitly states "callable or list/tuple of callable or None"
- The implementation has an assertion `assert callable(dataset)` showing intent to validate
- The inconsistent behavior is clearly a logic error, not intentional design

### Considering WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- The error only occurs when the cache directory doesn't exist, which could be considered an edge case
- No actual harm is done since there's nothing to clear anyway

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - new installations or first-time users will hit this
- Input validation should be consistent regardless of system state
- The fix is trivial (move validation before directory check)
- Inconsistent error handling makes debugging harder for users
- It violates the fail-fast principle which is important for API design

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- None applicable. The documentation is correct and clear.

**Why it's NOT DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
- The code has validation that matches the documentation (line 36: assert callable)
- The issue is a code bug, not a documentation error

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue that accepting strings/integers might be a useful enhancement

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The bug report isn't asking for new functionality
- It's reporting that existing documented behavior is violated
- The code already has validation logic that's being bypassed due to a bug

### Considering BUG
**Why it IS a BUG:**
- **Clear API contract violation**: Documentation specifies only callable/list of callable/None
- **Inconsistent behavior**: Same input produces different results based on filesystem state
- **Validation bypass**: The assert statement on line 36 shows clear intent to validate, but it's bypassed
- **Easy to fix**: Simple reordering of validation logic before early return
- **Real-world impact**: New users or CI environments without cache will miss input errors
- **Violates fail-fast principle**: Errors should be caught immediately, not conditionally
- **The implementation has validation code** that's meant to run but doesn't in certain cases

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has documented parameter requirements and validation code to enforce them, but a logic error causes the validation to be bypassed when the cache directory doesn't exist. This creates inconsistent behavior that violates the documented API contract and the principle of fail-fast error handling.
