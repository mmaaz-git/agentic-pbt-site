Bug Reproduction Report for scipy.constants.find()
===================================================

I successfully reproduced the reported bug. The bug report is accurate in its claims.

## Reproduction Results

1. **Test Output Verification**:
   - Total keys in physical_constants: 445 (matches report)
   - Keys returned by find(None): 355 (matches report)
   - Keys returned by find(''): 355 (matches report)
   - Missing from find(None): 90 keys (matches report)

2. **Property-Based Tests**:
   - test_find_none_returns_all_keys: FAILED as reported
   - test_find_empty_string_returns_all_keys: FAILED as reported

3. **Code Investigation**:

   I examined the source code at `/home/npc/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/constants/_codata.py` and confirmed:

   - The `find()` function implementation uses `_current_constants` instead of `physical_constants`
   - `_current_constants` is set to `_physical_constants_2022` (containing 355 keys)
   - `physical_constants` is a cumulative dictionary containing constants from all CODATA versions:
     * _physical_constants_2006
     * _physical_constants_2010
     * _physical_constants_2014
     * _physical_constants_2018
     * _physical_constants_2022
   - This results in `physical_constants` having 445 keys total

4. **Missing Keys Verification**:

   I confirmed that the 90 missing keys are exactly the difference between `physical_constants` and `_current_constants`. These are older constants from previous CODATA versions that are not in the 2022 dataset.

   Sample missing keys verified:
   - 'atomic unit of 2nd hyperpolarizablity'
   - 'electron-muon magn. moment ratio'
   - 'electron gyromagn. ratio'
   - 'Planck constant in eV s'
   - 'electric constant'

## Conclusion

The bug is real and reproducible. The `find()` function searches only the current CODATA 2022 constants (_current_constants with 355 keys) instead of all available constants (physical_constants with 445 keys), despite the documentation claiming it returns keys from physical_constants and should return "all keys" when sub=None.
