BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
----------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The function documentation clearly states it accepts "callable or list/tuple of callable or None"
- The code has explicit validation (assert callable(dataset) and ValueError checks)
- This validation is bypassed when cache doesn't exist due to early return
- Inconsistent behavior: same invalid input raises exception when cache exists but not when cache doesn't exist
- Violates the principle of input validation - invalid inputs should be rejected consistently
- The fix is straightforward and improves API consistency

Arguments AGAINST:
- When cache doesn't exist, there's technically nothing to clear anyway
- The function does print a message indicating nothing was done

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
---------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- None - the bug is clearly reproducible and the behavior contradicts documented requirements

Arguments AGAINST:
- The code demonstrably skips validation when cache doesn't exist
- Documentation specifies only callables are valid inputs
- The inconsistent behavior is objectively present

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
---------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The practical impact is limited since invalid inputs wouldn't do anything anyway
- Users would likely notice the issue quickly from the print message
- Edge case that may not occur frequently in practice

Arguments AGAINST:
- Input validation is a fundamental API contract
- Silent acceptance of invalid inputs can mask programming errors
- Inconsistent behavior makes the API harder to understand and use correctly
- The fix is simple and improves code quality

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
--------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- None - the code already has validation logic, it's just bypassed

Arguments AGAINST:
- The validation code exists and works when cache exists
- This is clearly a bug where existing validation is bypassed, not a missing feature

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Documentation could be clearer about exception behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- Documentation correctly states valid inputs are callables
- The code has validation that matches the documentation
- The issue is implementation, not documentation

FINAL ASSESSMENT
================
This is a valid BUG. The function has documented parameter requirements and validation code that is incorrectly bypassed in certain conditions. The inconsistent behavior (raising exceptions when cache exists but not when it doesn't) violates API consistency principles and the documented contract that parameters must be callables.
