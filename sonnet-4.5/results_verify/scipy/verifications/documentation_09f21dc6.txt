## Documentation Analysis for scipy.spatial.ConvexHull Incremental Mode

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **Incremental Mode Parameter:**
   - The `incremental` parameter is documented as allowing "adding new points incrementally"
   - Default is False, must be explicitly set to True to enable incremental processing
   - Takes up "some additional resources" when enabled

2. **add_points() Method:**
   - Requires `incremental=True` to be set during initial ConvexHull construction
   - Accepts new points matching the dimensionality of initial points
   - Has an optional `restart` parameter to restart processing from scratch
   - Cannot be called after `close()` has been called

3. **Volume Calculation Behavior:**
   - **CRITICAL**: The documentation does NOT specify how volume should be calculated after add_points()
   - No explicit guarantee that incremental and batch construction should produce identical volumes
   - No warnings about potential differences in volume calculation between modes

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The documentation does not explicitly state that incremental construction should be mathematically equivalent to batch construction
   - No specific promises about attribute consistency (like volume) between the two modes
   - The documentation focuses on the ability to add points, not on the mathematical equivalence of results

5. **Limitations and Warnings:**
   - Only mentions QhullError for geometrical degeneracy issues
   - No specific warnings about volume calculation differences
   - No explicit statement about equivalence of incremental vs batch results

### Critical Observation:
The documentation is silent on whether incremental and batch ConvexHull constructions with the same final point set should produce identical results for computed properties like volume. This is neither explicitly guaranteed nor explicitly warned against as a limitation.

The documentation appears to treat incremental mode primarily as a convenience feature for adding points progressively, without making strong mathematical guarantees about the equivalence of computed properties to batch mode.
