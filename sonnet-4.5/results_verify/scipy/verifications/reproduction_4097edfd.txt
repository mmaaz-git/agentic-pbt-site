## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Case 1: Specific Failing Input
**Input:** 4 repeated poles at s = -5
```
zeros = []
poles = [-5+0j, -5+0j, -5+0j, -5+0j]
gain = 1.0
```

**Results:**
- Original poles: [-5, -5, -5, -5]
- After round-trip conversion: [-5.00103355, -4.99999988, -4.99999988, -4.99896668]
- Maximum error: 1.033553e-03
- Relative error: 0.02%

**Verification:** The bug report's claim is CONFIRMED. The error exceeds 0.001 as stated.

### Test Case 2: Property-Based Testing
Ran 50 random test cases with repeated poles between -5 and -0.1, with 2-5 repetitions.

**Results:**
- 8 out of 50 cases failed (16% failure rate)
- Failures occurred mainly with 5 repeated poles
- Maximum errors ranged from 1.15e-3 to 5.18e-3
- Relative errors reached up to 0.12%

### Test Case 3: Error vs Number of Repeated Poles
Testing with pole at s = -5:
- 2 repeated poles: max error = 0.000000e+00 (perfect)
- 3 repeated poles: max error = 2.483190e-05 (acceptable)
- 4 repeated poles: max error = 1.033553e-03 (exceeds 1e-3)
- 5 repeated poles: max error = 5.956905e-03 (significant)

**Key Finding:** Error increases dramatically with the number of repeated poles.

### Test Case 4: Non-Repeated Poles
**Input:** Distinct poles at [-1, -2, -3, -4]
**Result:** Maximum error = 3.86e-14 (machine precision)

**Conclusion:** The problem is specific to repeated poles, not a general conversion issue.

### Mathematical Verification

The conversion process:
1. zpk2tf: Expands (s+5)^4 = s^4 + 20s^3 + 150s^2 + 500s + 625
2. tf2zpk: Finds roots of this polynomial using numpy's polynomial root finder

The issue is that finding repeated roots from polynomial coefficients is numerically unstable. This is a well-known problem in numerical analysis:
- The condition number for root-finding increases with multiplicity
- Small perturbations in coefficients (due to floating-point arithmetic) cause larger perturbations in computed roots

### Summary

The bug report is technically accurate:
1. The round-trip conversion DOES lose precision with repeated poles
2. The error DOES exceed 1e-3 for 4 or more repeated poles
3. The relative error can reach 0.1% or more
4. This is NOT documented in the function documentation

The root cause is correctly identified: polynomial root-finding is inherently ill-conditioned for repeated roots. This is a fundamental mathematical limitation, not a coding error.
