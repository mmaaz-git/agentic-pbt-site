## Documentation Analysis

### scipy.sparse.eye_array Documentation

I've examined the documentation from multiple sources:

1. **Function Docstring** (in _construct.py lines 374-410):
   - States: "Sparse array of chosen shape with ones on the kth diagonal and zeros elsewhere"
   - Parameter `k`: "Diagonal to place ones on. Default: 0 (main diagonal)"
   - **No explicit constraints or bounds are documented for the k parameter**

2. **Online Documentation** (scipy.org):
   - Confirms k parameter controls diagonal placement (positive = upper, negative = lower)
   - **No documented restrictions on k values**
   - No mention of any ValueError for out-of-bounds k values

3. **Related Function diags_array Documentation** (lines 100-174):
   - States offsets can be "k > 0 the kth upper diagonal" or "k < 0 the kth lower diagonal"
   - **No upper or lower bounds mentioned**
   - Examples show normal usage but don't demonstrate edge cases

### Key Finding

The documentation does NOT specify any constraints on the k parameter. There is no mention that:
- k must be within any particular range
- ValueError will be raised for certain k values
- There are any bounds on diagonal offsets

### Comparison with NumPy

NumPy's documentation for `np.diag` also doesn't explicitly state bounds, but the implementation accepts any k value gracefully, returning empty arrays for out-of-bounds diagonals.

### Conclusion

The current behavior where `abs(k) > n` raises a ValueError is **undocumented**. Users reading the documentation would have no reason to expect this error. The documentation implies that any integer k value should be acceptable, with the natural expectation that out-of-bounds diagonals would simply be empty (contain no elements).
