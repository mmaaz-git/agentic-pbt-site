## Documentation Findings for scipy.signal.windows.tukey

### Official Documentation Review

The scipy.signal.windows.tukey function documentation states:

1. **Alpha Parameter Description**:
   - Type: float, optional (default=0.5)
   - Description: "Shape parameter of the Tukey window, representing the fraction of the window inside the cosine tapered region."
   - Special cases mentioned:
     - "If zero, the Tukey window is equivalent to a rectangular window."
     - "If one, the Tukey window is equivalent to a Hann window."

2. **Valid Range for Alpha**:
   - The documentation does NOT specify any minimum positive value for alpha
   - The documentation does NOT mention any numerical limitations
   - The documentation does NOT warn about potential overflow issues with very small alpha values
   - The parameter is simply described as "float" with no range constraints mentioned beyond the special cases at 0 and 1

3. **Mathematical Definition** (from Wikipedia reference):
   - The Tukey window is mathematically well-defined for alpha in [0, 1]
   - The formula involves division by alpha when alpha > 0
   - No numerical constraints or limitations are mentioned in the mathematical definition

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Looking at the source code (lines 931-946), the implementation has:
     - Special case for alpha <= 0: returns rectangular window (all ones)
     - Special case for alpha >= 1.0: returns Hann window
     - For 0 < alpha < 1, it computes the tapered cosine window
   - Line 946 contains: `w3 = 0.5 * (1 + xp.cos(xp.pi * (-2.0/alpha + 1 + 2.0*n3/alpha/(M-1))))`
   - This line performs division by alpha without any guard against overflow

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation does not specify what happens for extremely small positive alpha values
2. There is no mention of numerical stability issues or overflow risks
3. The documentation implies alpha can be ANY float value in the range [0, 1], including values arbitrarily close to zero
4. No minimum threshold for alpha is documented
5. The expected behavior for denormalized or subnormal float values is not specified

### Conclusion from Documentation

Based on the documentation alone, a user would reasonably expect that ANY float value in [0, 1] should work correctly for the alpha parameter. The documentation provides no warning that values below a certain threshold (like 1e-308) would cause NaN results due to numerical overflow. The special case handling explicitly mentions alpha=0 but does not address the region where 0 < alpha < epsilon for some small epsilon where numerical issues arise.
