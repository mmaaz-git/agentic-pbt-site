## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation:
The scipy.datasets.clear_cache function's docstring states:
- "Cleans the scipy datasets cache directory"
- Accepts "callable or list/tuple of callable or None" as the datasets parameter
- When specific datasets are provided, removes only those datasets' cached files

### Key Observations:

1. **No explicit error handling documentation**: The docstring does not explicitly state what happens when an invalid dataset is passed. It doesn't say "raises ValueError for invalid datasets."

2. **However, the code implementation shows clear intent**:
   - Lines 38-42 explicitly check if dataset_name is in method_map
   - Raises ValueError with detailed message: "Dataset method {dataset_name} doesn't exist. Please check if the passed dataset is a subset of the following dataset methods: {list(method_map.keys())}"
   - This indicates deliberate validation logic, not accidental behavior

3. **Parameter type expectations**:
   - The docstring states datasets should be "callable or list/tuple of callable"
   - The code enforces this with `assert callable(dataset)` at line 36
   - The code validates dataset names against a registry (method_files_map)

4. **Implicit contract from the implementation**:
   - The presence of validation logic (lines 36-42) strongly suggests that validation is an intended feature
   - The detailed error message provides helpful guidance to users about valid options
   - The validation appears to be a deliberate design choice to prevent silent failures

### Conclusion on Documentation:
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that ValueError should be raised for invalid datasets, the implementation shows this is clearly intentional behavior. The bug violates this implicit contract by allowing the early return to bypass validation when the cache directory doesn't exist. The validation should occur regardless of cache directory existence to maintain consistent behavior.
