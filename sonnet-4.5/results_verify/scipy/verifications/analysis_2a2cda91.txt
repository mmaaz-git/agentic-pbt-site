## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The function does return NaN values as reported
- The behavior violates reasonable user expectations

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The report accurately describes a real problem
- The code demonstrably fails with NaN values
- The numerical overflow is a genuine issue

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Beta=710 with M=3 is an extreme edge case
- The documentation does mention NaN possibility
- Users could work around it by checking parameters

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is a numerical computing library where correctness matters
- Silent NaN propagation can corrupt entire computations
- The fix is straightforward (parameter validation)
- Scientific users expect robust numerical handling

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Adding parameter validation could be seen as a new feature
- The function technically works as documented (mentions NaN possibility)
- Requesting better numerical stability could be enhancement

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- Returning NaN for valid numeric inputs is a bug, not missing feature
- Window functions should return windows, not NaN arrays

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation does mention NaN possibility (line 1244)
- Could argue the docs just need to be clearer about limits
- The behavior matches what's vaguely documented

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The problem is the code behavior, not just documentation
- Even with better docs, silent NaN returns are problematic
- The Returns section incorrectly states values are "normalized to 1"
- Users shouldn't need to memorize magic threshold values

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
1. **Silent failure**: Returns NaN without raising exception
2. **Violates interface contract**: Window functions should return valid windows
3. **Inconsistent with scipy standards**: Most scipy functions validate inputs
4. **Inadequate warning**: Documentation mentions NaN but provides no actionable guidance
5. **Predictable failure point**: Occurs at betaâ‰¥710, which is deterministic
6. **Easy to fix**: Simple parameter validation would prevent the issue
7. **High impact**: Can corrupt scientific calculations silently

**Arguments against BUG:**
- Documentation technically mentions the NaN possibility
- Could be considered expected behavior for numerical overflow

### Decision Rationale

This should be classified as **BUG** because:

1. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Users expect window functions to return valid windows or raise exceptions, not silently return NaN

2. **Scientific Computing Standards**: In numerical libraries, functions should either:
   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Raise clear exceptions for invalid inputs
   - Never silently return invalid numeric values

3. **Documentation Inadequacy**: While NaN is mentioned, the warning is:
   - Too vague to be actionable
   - Contradicted by the Returns section
   - Not specific about failure conditions

4. **Real-World Impact**: Unlike truly obscure edge cases, beta=710 is within the range of values users might reasonably try, especially in optimization or parameter sweeps

5. **Fixability**: The issue has straightforward solutions (validation, numerical stability improvements)

The fact that overflow causes NaN is a implementation bug that should be fixed, not documented away. The current behavior fails the basic contract of a window function.
