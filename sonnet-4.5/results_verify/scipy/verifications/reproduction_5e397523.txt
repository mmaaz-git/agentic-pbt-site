BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

1. PRIMARY TEST CASE (from bug report):
   Input: y = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0] (all non-negative values)
   Result from cumulative_simpson with initial=0: [0.0, -0.08333333, 0.33333333]

   CONFIRMED: The cumulative integral goes NEGATIVE (-0.0833) at index 1
   This happens despite all input values being non-negative (≥ 0)

2. HYPOTHESIS PROPERTY-BASED TEST:
   The property test successfully found MULTIPLE failing cases:
   - [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]: produces negative value -0.08333333
   - [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]: produces non-monotonic cumulative (decreases from 0.417 to 0.333)
   - [257703.23, 0.0, 0.0]: produces large negative difference -21475.27
   - Many other cases with similar patterns

   The test confirms this is NOT an isolated edge case but a systematic issue.

3. COMPARISON WITH cumulative_trapezoid:
   Same input [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]:
   - cumulative_trapezoid result: [0.0, 0.0, 0.5]
   - No negative values, properly monotonic
   - This shows the issue is specific to Simpson's method

4. MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION:
   Manual calculation confirms the implementation is CORRECT:
   - For points (0,0), (1,0), (2,1), Simpson fits quadratic p(x) = 0.5x² - 0.5x
   - This quadratic is NEGATIVE on interval [0,1] with minimum at x=0.5
   - Integral from 0 to 1 = -1/12 = -0.08333... (matches scipy output)
   - The implementation correctly follows the mathematical formula

5. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
   Simpson's rule fits a quadratic through three points. When data has sharp transitions
   (like [0, 0, 1]), the fitted quadratic can "overshoot" and become negative between
   the original non-negative data points. This is an inherent property of quadratic
   interpolation, NOT an implementation bug.

6. SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
   - The behavior is mathematically correct according to Simpson's rule
   - But violates the fundamental calculus property that cumulative integral
     of non-negative function should be non-decreasing
   - This could cause silent errors in scientific computations expecting monotonicity
