## Reproduction Analysis

### Bug Report Claims vs Reality

**Claim**: The method returns `inf` for single-element arrays
**Reality**: The method raises `ZeroDivisionError` for single-element arrays

When testing `NumericAttribute._basic_stats` with a single-element array `[5.0]`:
- Expected (per bug report): Returns `(5.0, 5.0, 5.0, inf)`
- Actual behavior: Raises `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`

The bug report's claim that "nbfac = 1.0 / 0 = inf" is incorrect. In Python, `1.0 / 0` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, it does not return infinity.

### Additional Bugs Found

1. **Empty arrays**: The method also fails for empty arrays with `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation fmin which has no identity`

2. **Incorrect formula**: The method uses an incorrect formula for sample standard deviation:
   - Current: `std * (n / (n-1))`
   - Correct: `std * sqrt(n / (n-1))`

   This means even for arrays with 2+ elements, the calculated standard deviation is wrong.

### Mathematical Context

The method appears to be attempting to calculate sample standard deviation using Bessel's correction. The sample standard deviation formula is:

```
s = sqrt(sum((x_i - mean)^2) / (n-1))
```

This can be computed from population standard deviation as:
```
sample_std = population_std * sqrt(n / (n-1))
```

However, the code incorrectly uses `n/(n-1)` instead of `sqrt(n/(n-1))`.

For n=1, sample standard deviation is mathematically undefined because:
- The denominator (n-1) becomes 0
- You cannot estimate population variance from a single sample

### Testing Results

1. Single element array `[5.0]`: ZeroDivisionError (not inf as claimed)
2. Empty array `[]`: ValueError
3. Two elements `[5.0, 10.0]`: Returns 5.0 instead of correct 3.536
4. Five elements `[1,2,3,4,5]`: Returns 1.768 instead of correct 1.581

### Is This Actually a Bug?

The core issue exists: the method fails for single-element arrays. However:
1. The bug report incorrectly describes the failure mode
2. The method has additional problems not mentioned
3. Most importantly: **The method is never called anywhere in the codebase** (dead code)
