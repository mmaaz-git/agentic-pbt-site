BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
======================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. THE BUG EXISTS AND IS REPRODUCIBLE
   The bug report is accurate - the `iterations` field in the zeros_full_output struct
   contains uninitialized memory (garbage values) when certain conditions are met.

2. REPRODUCTION RESULTS
   Running the exact code from the bug report with a0=0.0 (root at boundary xa=0):
   - iterations=-346829376 (garbage value)
   - funcalls=2 (correct)
   - error_num=0 (success)
   - root=0.0 (correct)

   The expected behavior would be iterations >= 0 (likely 0 or 1 for a boundary case).

3. PATTERN OF THE BUG
   The bug occurs:
   - When the root is EXACTLY at one of the boundaries (xa or xb)
   - Specifically when the function evaluates to zero (or within tolerance) at xa or xb
   - The algorithm terminates early after just 2 function evaluations
   - The iterations field is never initialized, containing whatever was in memory

   The bug is intermittent/non-deterministic:
   - Multiple runs with the same input produce different garbage values
   - Sometimes iterations=-654327360, sometimes 1, sometimes 9997
   - This confirms it's uninitialized memory, not a deterministic calculation error

4. TESTED SCENARIOS

   Scenarios where bug OCCURS:
   - Root exactly at xa=0: iterations contains garbage
   - Root exactly at xa=-5: sometimes garbage, sometimes valid

   Scenarios where bug DOES NOT occur:
   - Root in middle of interval (x=5): iterations=2 (valid)
   - Root found after bisection iterations: iterations=8 (valid)
   - Root at xb=-2: iterations appears valid

5. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
   The function being tested is a polynomial: f(x) = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + a3*x^3
   When args=(0,0,0,1), it becomes f(x) = x^3

   When the root-finding algorithm (brentq/bisect/ridder/brenth) checks the boundaries:
   - It evaluates f(xa) and f(xb)
   - If f(xa) â‰ˆ 0, it returns xa immediately
   - The early return path doesn't initialize the iterations field
   - The struct contains whatever garbage was in memory at that location

6. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS
   The hypothesis-based property test failed immediately, confirming the bug is systematic
   and not a rare edge case. The test correctly identified that successful solves should
   have iterations >= 1, but found garbage negative values instead.

CONCLUSION: The bug is REAL and REPRODUCIBLE. The iterations field contains uninitialized
memory when root-finding functions terminate early at boundary values.
