DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR scipy.fftpack.dct

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS:
The scipy.fftpack.dct documentation explicitly states:
- "Type I: Supported for input size > 1"
- This is clearly documented in the official SciPy documentation at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.dct.html

2. DCT TYPE 1 CONSTRAINTS:
The documentation specifies two critical constraints for DCT Type 1:
a) Size constraint: Input arrays MUST have size greater than 1 (single element arrays are NOT supported)
b) Normalization constraint: Only norm=None is supported for DCT-I (orthogonal normalization is not available)

3. COMPARISON WITH OTHER DCT TYPES:
- DCT Type 2, 3, and 4 do not have the size > 1 constraint mentioned in the documentation
- The documentation only specifically calls out this limitation for Type 1

4. MATHEMATICAL CONTEXT:
The documentation describes DCT-I as:
- "Equivalent to the FFT (though faster) for real, even-symmetrical inputs"
- "The output is also real and even-symmetrical"
- This mathematical definition may inherently require more than one element

5. ERROR HANDLING:
The documentation does NOT specify what error should be raised when violating the size constraint. It simply states the constraint exists.

6. CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER TRANSFORMS:
The documentation does not explicitly require all DCT types to handle single elements uniformly. Each type has its own mathematical definition and constraints.

CONCLUSION FROM DOCUMENTATION:
The behavior reported in the bug (DCT Type 1 crashing on single-element arrays) is CONSISTENT with the documented constraint that DCT Type 1 is "only supported for input size > 1". This is not undocumented behavior - it is explicitly stated in the official documentation.
