## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### 1. Simple Reproduction Case
The basic test case `integrate.tanhsinh(lambda x: 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)` fails exactly as described with:
- **Error Type**: IndexError
- **Error Message**: "too many indices for array: array is 0-dimensional, but 1 were indexed"
- **Location**: scipy/integrate/_tanhsinh.py, line 421

### 2. Property-Based Testing
The hypothesis test fails consistently when the function returns a scalar. Multiple test cases with various scalar constants all fail with the same IndexError.

### 3. Workaround Verification
The workaround suggested in the bug report (`lambda x: np.full_like(x, 0.0)`) does work, though it returns success=False with the correct integral value of 0.0. This confirms that the issue is specifically with scalar-returning functions.

### 4. Comparison with Other Integration Functions
As stated in the bug report:
- `integrate.quad(lambda x: 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)` works correctly and returns (0.0, 0.0)
- `integrate.quad_vec(lambda x: 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)` works correctly and returns (0.0, 0.0)
- Only `integrate.tanhsinh` crashes with scalar-returning functions

### Conclusion
The bug is real and reproducible. The function crashes when given a scalar-returning function, which is inconsistent with other scipy integration functions that handle this case gracefully. The error occurs during array indexing operations when the function attempts to apply a mask to what it expects to be an array but is actually a scalar.
