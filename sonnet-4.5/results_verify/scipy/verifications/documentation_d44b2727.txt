## Documentation Analysis

### Source Code Documentation

The docstring in the pandas source code (`pandas/core/arrays/sparse/array.py`, lines 1238-1293) explicitly states:

1. **Main Claim (line 1241-1242):**
   > "The output will always be a SparseArray. To convert to a dense ndarray with a certain dtype, use :meth:`numpy.asarray`."

2. **Return Type Documentation (lines 1256-1258):**
   > Returns
   > -------
   > SparseArray

3. **Parameter Description (lines 1246-1251):**
   The documentation describes handling of both SparseDtype and other dtypes, but doesn't indicate that non-SparseDtype arguments would return a dense array.

4. **Examples in Docstring:**
   All examples show SparseArray being returned, even when using regular numpy dtypes.

### GitHub Issue #34457 Context

The implementation references GitHub issue #34457 with a comment. Investigation of this issue reveals:

1. **Original Behavior:**
   Previously, `astype()` would always return a SparseArray by automatically converting any dtype to SparseDtype.

2. **Change Rationale:**
   The behavior was changed to ensure that `obj.astype(dtype).dtype == dtype`, meaning if you request a regular numpy dtype, you get exactly that dtype back.

3. **Implementation Decision:**
   PR #45339 changed the implementation to return a dense array for non-SparseDtype arguments, which was merged and included in pandas 1.5.

### Documentation vs Implementation Conflict

There is a clear conflict:
- **Documentation says:** Always returns SparseArray
- **Implementation does:** Returns dense array for non-SparseDtype arguments
- **Historical context:** The implementation was intentionally changed but the docstring was not updated

### Official Pandas Documentation

The pandas documentation website references this behavior but older versions (0.24.2) show the same "always returns SparseArray" language, indicating this has been a long-standing documentation issue.

### Conclusion

This is a documentation bug. The implementation was deliberately changed to return dense arrays for non-SparseDtype arguments (as per GH#34457), but the docstring was never updated to reflect this change. The docstring incorrectly states that the output will "always" be a SparseArray, when in fact it only returns a SparseArray when given a SparseDtype argument.
