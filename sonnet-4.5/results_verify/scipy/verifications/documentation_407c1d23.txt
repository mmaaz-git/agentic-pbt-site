DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Review:

1. Function Docstring (from full_output_example.__doc__):
   - States it returns "the zero function error number" in the full_output dict
   - Does not explicitly define what error_num=-1 means
   - Does not mention any tolerance for treating values as zero
   - States it finds roots of a 3rd order polynomial

2. Related Documentation in scipy.optimize._zeros_py.py:
   - Clearly defines error codes:
     * _ECONVERGED = 0 (converged)
     * _ESIGNERR = -1 (sign error)
     * _ECONVERR = -2 (convergence error)
     * _EVALUEERR = -3 (value error)
   - SIGNERR is explicitly mapped to 'sign error'
   - These constants are noted to "Must agree with CONVERGED, SIGNERR, CONVERR, ... in zeros.h"

3. General Bracketing Method Requirements (from scipy.optimize.brentq docs):
   - States: "f must be continuous. f(a) and f(b) must have opposite signs."
   - This is a fundamental requirement for bracketing root-finding methods
   - The Intermediate Value Theorem requires opposite signs to guarantee a root exists

4. What the Documentation Implies:
   - Bracketing methods require f(xa) and f(xb) to have opposite signs
   - When this condition is not met, a sign error (error_num=-1) should be returned
   - There is no documented tolerance below which function values should be treated as zero

5. Missing Documentation:
   - The function does not document that very small function values (< ~1e-50) may be treated as zero
   - This undocumented behavior leads to incorrect error reporting
   - Users have no way to know about this limitation from the documentation

Conclusion:
The documentation, combined with standard mathematical requirements for bracketing methods and the defined error codes in the codebase, clearly indicates that when f(xa) and f(xb) have the same sign, the function should return error_num=-1 (sign error). The current behavior violates this expectation without any documented justification.
