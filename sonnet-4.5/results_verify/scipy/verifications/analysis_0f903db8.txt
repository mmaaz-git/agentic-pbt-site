TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect)
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The shape inconsistency is real and reproducible
   - The test correctly identifies a dimensional mismatch
   - The behavior does cause friction for users

   Arguments FOR:
   - tf2ss actually DOES accept 2-D arrays, so round-trip works
   - The documentation clearly states ss2tf returns 2-D arrays
   - No explicit promise of shape preservation in round-trips
   - The functions work as documented

2. WONTFIX (Trivial or obscure issue)
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This affects common use cases (SISO systems are very common)
   - Shape inconsistency causes real problems with other functions (np.poly1d)
   - Not an obscure edge case - affects all single-output systems

   Arguments FOR:
   - Workaround is simple (use .squeeze())
   - Existing code probably already handles this
   - Not a functional bug - the math is correct

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation should be updated)
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Documentation accurately describes current behavior
   - ss2tf docs clearly state it returns 2-D array

   Arguments FOR:
   - Could add a note about round-trip shape changes
   - Could document that tf2ss accepts both 1-D and 2-D
   - Could add example showing the squeeze() workaround

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality needed)
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Not asking for new functionality
   - The functions already do what they're supposed to do

   Arguments FOR:
   - Could be seen as requesting a new "shape preservation" feature
   - Requesting smarter behavior for SISO systems
   - Enhancement to existing functionality rather than bug fix

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Functions work as documented
   - Round-trip technically works (tf2ss accepts 2-D)
   - No promise of shape preservation in docs
   - MIMO systems need 2-D arrays, so consistent behavior

   Arguments FOR:
   - Violates principle of least surprise
   - Inconsistent with other conversion functions (zpk2tf returns 1-D)
   - Creates unnecessary friction for the common SISO case
   - Forces users to add manual shape manipulation
   - Other scipy functions expect 1-D for SISO

ASSESSMENT:
The core issue is that while the functions work as documented, the design choice to always
return 2-D arrays from ss2tf creates unnecessary complexity for SISO systems. The inconsistency
with other conversion functions (like zpk2tf which returns 1-D for SISO) suggests this is
more than just a documentation issue.

The fact that tf2ss silently accepts both 1-D and 2-D arrays somewhat mitigates the issue,
but users still encounter problems when using the output with other functions expecting 1-D
arrays. The bug report's suggestion to squeeze SISO outputs would improve usability without
breaking MIMO support.

This is a borderline case between FEATURE_REQUEST and BUG. It's not a bug in the traditional
sense (code doesn't match documentation), but it's a design flaw that causes real usability
issues. Given that:
1. Other scipy conversion functions (zpk2tf) handle this better
2. It affects the common case (SISO) negatively
3. The fix would improve consistency within scipy.signal

I lean toward classifying this as a valid BUG - a design bug rather than implementation bug.
