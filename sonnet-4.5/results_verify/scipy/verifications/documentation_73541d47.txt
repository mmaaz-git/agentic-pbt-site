Documentation Review for scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation

After thorough review of the scipy documentation for the Rotation class and its rotvec methods, here are the key findings:

1. **as_rotvec() Method Documentation:**
   - Converts Rotation to rotation vector representation
   - Returns a 3D vector where direction = rotation axis, magnitude = rotation angle
   - No explicit documentation about round-trip guarantees
   - No warnings about special behavior at magnitude π
   - Examples show simple conversions without mentioning edge cases

2. **from_rotvec() Method Documentation:**
   - Creates Rotation from rotation vectors
   - Accepts vectors where direction = axis, magnitude = angle
   - No documentation about handling of π magnitude rotations
   - No mention of potential sign ambiguity

3. **magnitude() Method Documentation:**
   - States that rotation magnitudes are constrained to [0, π]
   - Does not explain why or document implications
   - No warning about singularities at π

4. **Round-Trip Behavior:**
   - Documentation shows examples of converting between representations
   - Implies that conversions preserve rotation information
   - Does NOT explicitly guarantee that as_rotvec(from_rotvec(v)) == v
   - No documentation about potential sign flips at boundaries

5. **Critical Omission:**
   - The documentation does not mention the mathematical singularity at π rotations
   - At θ = π, the quaternion scalar w = cos(π/2) = 0, creating ambiguity
   - Both q = [x,y,z,0] and -q = [-x,-y,-z,0] represent the same rotation
   - This leads to non-deterministic round-trip behavior

6. **User Expectations vs Documentation:**
   - Users might reasonably expect round-trip consistency based on examples
   - However, the documentation never explicitly promises this property
   - The constraint to [0, π] is mentioned but not explained
   - No guidance provided for handling the π boundary case

Conclusion: The documentation lacks clarity about the behavior at π rotations. It neither guarantees round-trip consistency nor warns about the mathematical singularity that makes such consistency impossible at exactly π radians.
