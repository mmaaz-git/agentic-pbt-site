REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here's what I found:

1. HYPOTHESIS TEST REPRODUCTION:
   The provided Hypothesis test fails as described. When converting from transfer function
   to state-space and back, the shape changes from 1-D to 2-D:
   - Input num: shape (1,), ndim = 1
   - Output num after round-trip: shape (1, 2), ndim = 2
   - AssertionError: Shape inconsistency confirmed

2. MANUAL REPRODUCTION:
   Confirmed the behavior with the provided example:
   - Input: num = [1.0, 2.0] with shape (2,), 1-D array
   - After tf2ss -> ss2tf: num = [[0., 1., 2.]] with shape (1, 3), 2-D array
   - The extra dimension is added even for single-output systems

3. KEY FINDING - ROUND-TRIP STILL WORKS:
   Surprisingly, tf2ss DOES accept 2-D arrays with a single row, so the round-trip
   technically works without error:
   - tf2ss(num_2d, den) succeeds when num_2d has shape (1, n)
   - The results are identical to passing a 1-D array
   - This means the functions are technically compatible for round-trip conversion

4. COMPATIBILITY ISSUES:
   However, the shape change causes problems with other functions:
   - np.poly1d() requires 1-D arrays and fails with "Polynomial must be 1d only" error
   - Other polynomial functions may have similar expectations
   - Users must manually squeeze() the output to use it with these functions

5. MIMO vs SISO BEHAVIOR:
   The 2-D output makes sense for MIMO (multiple-output) systems where you need
   multiple rows of numerator coefficients. For SISO systems:
   - Even with 1 output, ss2tf returns shape (1, n) instead of (n,)
   - This creates unnecessary dimensional overhead for the common SISO case

EFFECT:
The bug causes a shape inconsistency that, while not breaking the round-trip conversion
directly (since tf2ss accepts 2-D input), does break the expected contract that conversion
functions should maintain compatible shapes. It requires users to add manual shape
manipulation (squeeze operations) when working with other polynomial functions or when
expecting consistent array dimensions across their workflow.
