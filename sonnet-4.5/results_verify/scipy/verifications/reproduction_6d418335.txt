## Reproduction Report for scipy.signal.deconvolve Bug

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The function scipy.signal.deconvolve crashes with a ValueError when the divisor array has a leading zero (divisor[0] == 0).

### Reproduction Steps and Results

1. **Hypothesis Test Execution**
   - Ran the provided property-based test using Hypothesis
   - Result: The test failed with two distinct failure cases:
     - Case 1: signal_array=[0.0, 0.0], divisor_array=[0.0, 1.0]
       Error: ValueError: BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet
     - Case 2: signal_array=[0.0], divisor_array=[0.0, 1.0]
       Error: ValueError: v cannot be empty (secondary error in convolve)

2. **Minimal Example Execution**
   - Ran the minimal reproducer from the bug report:
     ```python
     signal_arr = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
     divisor_arr = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
     quotient, remainder = signal.deconvolve(signal_arr, divisor_arr)
     ```
   - Result: ValueError: BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet
   - This confirms the exact error message reported

3. **Source Code Analysis**
   - Located the deconvolve function in /home/npc/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/signal/_signaltools.py
   - The function internally calls lfilter(num, den, input) at line 2471
   - lfilter then calls _sigtools._linear_filter which is a C implementation
   - The error message originates from the C implementation and explicitly states "BUG"

### Key Findings

1. **The error message itself admits it's a bug**: The error message says "BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet", explicitly acknowledging this as a known implementation limitation rather than intentional behavior.

2. **The crash is reproducible**: Both the Hypothesis test and minimal example consistently reproduce the crash with the same error.

3. **Implementation detail**: The deconvolve function uses lfilter internally, which cannot handle filter coefficients where a[0] == 0. This is an implementation limitation, not a mathematical limitation of deconvolution.

4. **No fallback handling**: The code does not check for or handle the case where divisor[0] == 0, allowing the error to propagate from the internal lfilter call.

### Conclusion
The bug report is accurate. The function crashes when divisor[0] == 0 with an error message that explicitly identifies itself as a "BUG" and states the feature is "not supported yet".
