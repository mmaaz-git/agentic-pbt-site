## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results
I successfully reproduced the reported bug. The test results confirm:

1. **Empty sparse matrix crash (Test 1):**
   - Created a 5x5 empty sparse matrix with nnz=0
   - Calling hb_write() resulted in: `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity`
   - The crash occurs at line 79 in hb.py: `indices_fmt = IntFormat.from_number(np.max(indices+1))`

2. **Hypothesis test with failing input (Test 2):**
   - Tested with rows=1, cols=1, nnz=0 as specified in the bug report
   - Confirmed the same ValueError crash
   - The error matches exactly what was reported

3. **Non-empty matrices work correctly (Test 3):**
   - Tested a 3x3 sparse matrix with 2 non-zero elements
   - Successfully wrote and read the matrix
   - Data was preserved correctly through the write/read cycle

### Technical Analysis
The crash occurs in the `HBInfo.from_data()` method at three locations:
1. Line 78: `pointer_fmt = IntFormat.from_number(np.max(pointer+1))`
2. Line 79: `indices_fmt = IntFormat.from_number(np.max(indices+1))`
3. Line 82: `values_fmt = ExpFormat.from_number(-np.max(np.abs(values)))`

When a sparse matrix has nnz=0:
- `pointer` array has size > 0 (it contains column pointers)
- `indices` array is empty (size=0)
- `values` array is empty (size=0)

Calling `np.max()` on an empty array without providing an `initial` parameter raises ValueError.

### Validity of Empty Sparse Matrices
Empty sparse matrices are mathematically valid:
- They represent all-zero matrices
- SciPy's sparse matrix constructors accept them
- Other sparse matrix operations handle them correctly
- The matrix has a valid shape and structure, just no non-zero elements

The bug report's claim is technically correct - the function crashes on valid input data.
