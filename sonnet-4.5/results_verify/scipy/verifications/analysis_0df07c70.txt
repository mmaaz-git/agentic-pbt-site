## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering Each Category:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function returns mathematically incorrect Jacobian matrices when using `@` or `np.matmul`
- The documentation clearly states J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j, but this is violated
- For linear functions f(x) = Ax, the Jacobian should be A, but scipy returns scrambled elements
- The bug is reproducible and consistent
- The bug silently produces wrong results, which is dangerous for numerical computations
- There's no documentation warning about this limitation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function works correctly with `np.dot` as a workaround
- The function works correctly for non-linear functions

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The function clearly violates its documented behavior.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation explicitly defines what the Jacobian should be
- Mathematical convention is clear and unambiguous
- The function produces objectively wrong results

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Users can work around by using `np.dot` instead of `@`
- Only affects specific matrix multiplication operators

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - matrix multiplication is fundamental
- The `@` operator is the modern, recommended way to do matrix multiplication in NumPy
- Silent wrong results in numerical computations are never acceptable
- The bug affects core mathematical functionality

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document that `@` and `np.matmul` don't work correctly
- Could warn users to use `np.dot` instead

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- Documenting a bug doesn't make it acceptable
- The expected behavior is mathematically well-defined

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. This is clearly broken existing functionality.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The Jacobian calculation is a core feature that should work
- This isn't asking for new functionality but for correct implementation

### Additional Findings:

1. **Root Cause**: The bug appears to be related to how scipy handles the vectorization of functions using `@` or `np.matmul`. These operators may interact differently with scipy's internal array reshaping.

2. **Scope**: Affects all functions using matrix multiplication with `@` or `np.matmul`, but not `np.dot`.

3. **Severity**: HIGH - Silent incorrect results in numerical differentiation can propagate through optimization, root-finding, and other algorithms.

4. **Workaround**: Exists (use `np.dot`), but users won't know they need it without documentation.

### Conclusion:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function violates its documented mathematical behavior, produces objectively incorrect results for common use cases, and fails silently. The existence of a workaround does not negate the fact that the primary functionality is broken. This is not a documentation issue, feature request, or trivial edge case - it's a fundamental correctness bug in a numerical library.
