## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation for step_factor

From the scipy.differentiate.derivative documentation:

**Parameter**: `step_factor : float, default: 2.0`

**Description**: "The factor by which the step size is *reduced* in each iteration; i.e. the step size in iteration 1 is `initial_step/step_factor`. If `step_factor < 1`, subsequent steps will be greater than the initial step; this may be useful if steps smaller than some threshold are undesirable (e.g. due to subtractive cancellation error)."

### Key Documentation Findings

1. **No explicit constraint on step_factor=1.0**
   - The documentation does not explicitly state that `step_factor` cannot equal 1.0
   - Only mentions that it's a float with default 2.0
   - Describes behavior for `step_factor < 1` and implicitly `step_factor > 1`
   - Silent on what happens when `step_factor = 1.0`

2. **Algorithmic implications not mentioned**
   - The documentation doesn't explain that the algorithm REQUIRES step size reduction to function properly
   - No mention that `step_factor=1.0` defeats the purpose of the iterative refinement
   - No warning about singular matrices or numerical instability near 1.0

3. **Input validation documentation**
   - The source code validation (lines 27-34) only checks that `step_factor >= 0`
   - The error message says "Tolerances and step parameters must be non-negative scalars"
   - This suggests `step_factor=1.0` should be valid according to current validation

4. **Algorithm description in Notes section**
   - States: "Each subsequent iteration, the maximum step size is reduced by step_factor"
   - When step_factor=1.0, this reduction doesn't happen (h/1 = h)
   - The algorithm relies on nested abscissae with different step sizes
   - Documentation doesn't explicitly state this requirement

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify that `step_factor=1.0` is invalid, nor does it explain why it would cause problems. A user reading the documentation would have no reason to expect that `step_factor=1.0` would cause a crash. The crash is due to an undocumented algorithmic requirement.
