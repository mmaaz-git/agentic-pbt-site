## Documentation Analysis for scipy.io.savemat oned_as Parameter

### Official Documentation Review

The scipy.io.savemat documentation clearly states that the `oned_as` parameter controls how 1-D NumPy arrays are written to MATLAB files:

- **oned_as='row'** (default): Write 1-D arrays as row vectors
- **oned_as='column'**: Write 1-D arrays as column vectors

### Mathematical Definition of Row and Column Vectors

In linear algebra and MATLAB:
- A **row vector** has shape (1, n) - one row, n columns
- A **column vector** has shape (m, 1) - m rows, one column

### Logical Extension to Empty Arrays

While the documentation doesn't explicitly mention empty arrays, the mathematical definition of row and column vectors logically extends to the empty case:
- An empty row vector should have shape (1, 0) - one row, zero columns
- An empty column vector should have shape (0, 1) - zero rows, one column

### Current vs Expected Behavior

The documentation promises that 1-D arrays will be written as either row or column vectors based on the oned_as parameter. The current implementation:

1. **Correctly handles non-empty arrays**:
   - (3,) with oned_as='row' → (1, 3) ✓
   - (3,) with oned_as='column' → (3, 1) ✓

2. **Incorrectly handles empty arrays**:
   - (0,) with oned_as='row' → (0, 0) instead of (1, 0) ✗
   - (0,) with oned_as='column' → (0, 0) instead of (0, 1) ✗

### Documentation Consistency

The documentation makes no exception for empty arrays. It states that the parameter controls "how 1-D NumPy arrays are written" without qualification. An empty 1-D array is still a 1-D array and should follow the same conversion rules.

### MATLAB Compatibility

MATLAB itself distinguishes between:
- Empty row vectors: zeros(1, 0) produces a 1×0 empty matrix
- Empty column vectors: zeros(0, 1) produces a 0×1 empty matrix
- Generic empty matrices: zeros(0, 0) produces a 0×0 empty matrix

These are different objects in MATLAB with different behaviors in operations like concatenation.

### Conclusion

The current behavior violates the documented contract of the oned_as parameter. The documentation promises to write 1-D arrays as row or column vectors, but fails to do so for empty arrays. This is not an undocumented edge case but a failure to implement the documented behavior consistently.
