## Bug Reproduction Results

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Property-Based Test
The property-based test from the bug report runs and fails exactly as described. When running with Hypothesis, it immediately finds a failing case with `invalid_key='0'`. The test fails with the assertion error "No warning issued for invalid key 0", confirming that no MatWriteWarning is raised for keys starting with digits.

### Simple Reproduction Test
The simple reproduction example provided in the bug report works exactly as described:
- Input: `{'0test': 123, 'validname': 456}`
- Output:
  - MatWriteWarnings issued: 0
  - Keys in saved file: ['0test', 'validname']

This confirms two issues:
1. No warning is issued for the key '0test' that starts with a digit
2. The data with key '0test' IS saved to the file (it appears in the loaded data)

### Comparison with Underscore-Prefixed Keys
To verify that the warning system works for other invalid keys, I tested with underscore-prefixed keys:
- Input: `{'_test': 123, 'validname': 456}`
- Output:
  - MatWriteWarnings issued: 1
  - Warning message: "Starting field name with a underscore (_test) is ignored"
  - Keys in saved file: ['validname']

This shows that underscore-prefixed keys work correctly:
- A MatWriteWarning is issued
- The data is NOT saved (only 'validname' appears in the loaded file)

### Conclusion
The bug is confirmed. The behavior for keys starting with digits is inconsistent with:
1. The documented behavior in the docstring
2. The actual behavior for keys starting with underscores
3. MATLAB's variable naming rules

The current implementation fails to handle digit-prefixed keys properly, both in terms of issuing warnings and preventing the data from being saved.
