# Bug Reproduction Report

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. 1D NumPy arrays do indeed lose their dimensionality when saved with `savemat` and loaded with `loadmat`.

## Hypothesis Test Results
The property-based test using Hypothesis failed as expected:
- Test case: `array([0.], dtype=float16)` with shape `(1,)`
- After round-trip: shape becomes `(1, 1)`
- The test fails on the first example, confirming that ALL 1D arrays fail the round-trip test

## Manual Reproduction Results

### Basic Round-trip Test
- Original array: `shape=(3,)`, `ndim=1`
- After save/load: `shape=(1, 3)`, `ndim=2`
- Shape preservation: **FAILED**

### Testing with `squeeze_me=True` Workaround

#### Multi-element 1D array:
- Original: `shape=(3,)`
- After save/load with `squeeze_me=True`: `shape=(3,)`
- Result: **Workaround successful** - shape preserved

#### Single-element 1D array:
- Original: `shape=(1,)`
- After save/load with `squeeze_me=True`: becomes a scalar `float` (not an array)
- Result: **Workaround fails** - type changes from array to scalar

## Conclusion
The bug is fully reproducible. The behavior matches exactly what the bug report describes:
1. 1D arrays always become 2D after round-trip through savemat/loadmat
2. The `squeeze_me=True` workaround is inconsistent:
   - Works for multi-element arrays
   - Fails for single-element arrays (converts to scalar)
