# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Considering Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function returns NaN for a valid input case (samples with identical variances)
- P-values should always be in [0, 1] by mathematical definition
- The chi-squared survival function correctly returns 1.0 for statistic=0
- The bug occurs in a realistic scenario (testing samples with equal variances)
- The function documentation states it returns a float p-value, not NaN
- This breaks downstream code that expects valid p-values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None identified

### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug is reproducible and mathematically incorrect

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The mathematical expectation is clear (p-value should be 1.0)
- The behavior violates basic statistical principles

### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Unimportant)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that identical samples are an edge case
- Users could check for NaN themselves

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - testing identical samples is valid
- P-values returning NaN breaks standard statistical workflows
- The fix is straightforward and important for correctness
- This is a statistical function where mathematical correctness matters

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - this is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new features

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function already exists and should work correctly
- Returning valid p-values is not a new feature but expected behavior

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Documentation doesn't explicitly say NaN is invalid

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code behavior is wrong, not the documentation
- P-values by definition must be probabilities in [0, 1]
- Documentation correctly states return type as float (implying valid number)
- No reasonable documentation would suggest NaN is acceptable for p-values

## Analysis Summary

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function returns mathematically incorrect output (NaN instead of 1.0) for a valid input case. The bug violates:

1. **Mathematical correctness**: When test statistic = 0, p-value must be 1.0
2. **Statistical principles**: P-values must be valid probabilities in [0, 1]
3. **API contract**: Documentation promises float returns, not NaN
4. **Practical usage**: Breaks downstream statistical analyses

The bug occurs when testing the exact null hypothesis case (equal variances), which is a fundamental scenario for this test. The fix is straightforward and necessary for correctness.
