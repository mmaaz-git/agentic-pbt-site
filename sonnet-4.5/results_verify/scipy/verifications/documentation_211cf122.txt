DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS: scipy.constants.precision

1. SCIPY DOCUMENTATION:
The official scipy documentation for precision() states:
- Returns "Relative precision in physical_constants indexed by key"
- Return type is float
- Example shows: constants.precision('proton mass') returns 5.1e-37 (a positive value)
- The documentation DOES NOT explicitly state that precision should always be positive
- The documentation DOES NOT mathematically define what "relative precision" means

2. SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION:
The docstring in the source code matches the public documentation and provides no additional clarification on:
- Whether negative values are acceptable
- The mathematical definition of "relative precision"
- Any constraints on the return value

3. GENERAL SCIENTIFIC DEFINITIONS:
From physics and measurement science sources:
- "Relative uncertainty" (synonymous with relative precision) is defined as:
  absolute_uncertainty / measured_value
- It's commonly expressed as a fraction or percentage
- In scientific measurement contexts, relative uncertainty represents the magnitude of uncertainty relative to the measurement
- By mathematical convention and physical meaning, relative uncertainties are treated as positive quantities representing the size/magnitude of the uncertainty

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS:
a) The scipy documentation never explicitly defines what "relative precision" means mathematically
b) The documentation never states whether negative values are allowed or forbidden
c) The example in the documentation shows a positive value, but this is not prescriptive
d) Standard scientific practice treats relative uncertainty/precision as a non-negative quantity

5. DOCUMENTATION GAP:
There is a clear documentation gap here. The scipy documentation:
- Does not define the mathematical formula for relative precision
- Does not specify the expected sign/range of values
- Does not explain how negative physical constants should be handled
- Relies on implicit understanding from physics/measurement science

6. CONCLUSION ON DOCUMENTATION:
While the documentation does not explicitly state that precision must be non-negative, this is a well-established convention in measurement science. The current implementation violates this implicit scientific convention by returning negative values for negative physical constants. The documentation should be clearer, but the absence of explicit specification doesn't make the current behavior correct from a scientific standpoint.
