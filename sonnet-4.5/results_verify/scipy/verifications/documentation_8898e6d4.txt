DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR scipy.signal.deconvolve
====================================================

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION STATES:

The scipy.signal.deconvolve function documentation clearly and explicitly states:

"Returns the quotient and remainder such that
signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder"

This is documented in:
- The function docstring
- The official scipy documentation website
- The function's help text

This mathematical property is presented as the fundamental guarantee of the function - it's not presented as an approximation or a best-effort attempt, but as an exact mathematical relationship.

2. MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP:

The documentation describes deconvolution as the inverse operation of convolution. The relationship
`signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder` is the standard polynomial division property, where:
- signal is the dividend
- divisor is the divisor
- quotient is the result of the division
- remainder is what's left over

This is analogous to integer division where: dividend = divisor Ã— quotient + remainder

3. RELATED FUNCTIONS:

The documentation explicitly references numpy.polydiv as performing "the same operation", suggesting that deconvolve should produce equivalent results to polynomial division.

4. NO WARNINGS ABOUT NUMERICAL LIMITATIONS:

The documentation does NOT include:
- Any warnings about numerical stability issues
- Any caveats about poorly conditioned divisors
- Any mention that the property might not hold exactly for certain inputs
- Any tolerance specifications for when the property should hold
- Any limitations on the types of signals that can be deconvolved accurately

5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:

Looking at the source code, scipy.signal.deconvolve uses lfilter() internally rather than polynomial division (polydiv). This is an implementation detail not mentioned in the documentation. The use of lfilter appears to introduce numerical instability for certain poorly conditioned divisors.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation makes an unqualified mathematical claim that the function satisfies the property
`signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder`. There are no documented exceptions, tolerances, or limitations to this property.
