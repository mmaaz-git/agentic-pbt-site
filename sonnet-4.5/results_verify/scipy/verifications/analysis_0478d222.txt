## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration as BUG:
- The `__str__` method crashes with IndexError on empty values, which is poor defensive programming
- Other Python objects typically handle empty collections gracefully in their string representations
- The fix is simple and makes the code more robust

### Consideration as INVALID:
- **Strong argument**: A NominalAttribute with empty values is semantically meaningless in the ARFF context - it would be an attribute that cannot hold any data
- The parser explicitly prevents empty nominal attributes with the regex `r'{(.+)}'`
- The constructor also prevents empty values by design (crashes on `max()` call)
- The only way to create such an object is through non-standard means (`__new__()` bypassing `__init__`)
- This is not a real-world scenario that would occur through normal library usage
- The ARFF format logically requires at least one value for a nominal attribute to be meaningful

### Consideration as WONTFIX:
- This is an extremely obscure edge case that requires deliberately bypassing the constructor
- No real ARFF file would have empty nominal attributes
- The crash is in an internal string representation method that users wouldn't normally encounter
- Fixing this would add code to handle a case that should never occur in practice

### Consideration as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation could explicitly state that nominal attributes must have at least one value
- However, this is already implicitly clear from the format and examples

### Consideration as FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Not applicable - this isn't requesting new functionality

## Conclusion:
This is **INVALID**. The bug report tests a scenario that:
1. Cannot occur through normal library usage (parser rejects it, constructor rejects it)
2. Has no semantic meaning in the ARFF context (an attribute with no possible values is meaningless)
3. Can only be triggered by deliberately bypassing the constructor using `__new__()`
4. Represents undefined behavior for an invalid object state

The library correctly prevents creation of NominalAttributes with empty values at all normal entry points. Testing the behavior of malformed objects created through `__new__()` is testing undefined behavior.
