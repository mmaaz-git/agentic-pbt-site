DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR scipy.signal.windows.flattop

From the official SciPy documentation and source code analysis:

1. FUNCTION SIGNATURE:
   scipy.signal.windows.flattop(M, sym=True, *, xp=None, device=None)

2. CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION STATEMENT:
   The function documentation explicitly states in the Returns section:
   "w : ndarray - The window, with the maximum value normalized to 1 (though the value 1
   does not appear if M is even and sym is True)."

   This clearly indicates that the maximum value should be normalized to 1.

3. FUNCTION PURPOSE:
   - Flat top windows are used for accurate signal amplitude measurements in the frequency domain
   - Minimizes scalloping error between frequency bin center and edges
   - This is a 5th-order cosine window with terms optimized for a maximally flat main lobe

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FROM SOURCE:
   The function uses fixed coefficients:
   a = [0.21557895, 0.41663158, 0.277263158, 0.083578947, 0.006947368]

   These coefficients are passed to _general_cosine_impl which implements:
   w = sum(a[k] * cos(k * fac)) for k in range(len(a))
   where fac = linspace(-pi, pi, M)

5. NORMALIZATION CLAIM:
   The documentation explicitly promises that "the maximum value normalized to 1". This is not
   a suggestion or approximation - it's stated as a fact about what the function returns.

6. COEFFICIENT SOURCE:
   The coefficients come from the reference: D'Antona and Ferrero, "Digital Signal Processing
   for Measurement Systems", 2006. The documentation does not indicate whether these coefficients
   were already normalized or if normalization should happen separately.

7. SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS:
   The documentation mentions that the value 1 may not appear if M is even and sym is True,
   but it still states the maximum is normalized to 1, meaning the maximum value should be
   exactly 1.0 or less, never exceeding it.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation unambiguously states that the window's maximum value is normalized to 1.
There is no ambiguity, qualification, or exception that would allow the maximum value to
exceed 1.0 under any circumstances.
