## Documentation Analysis for scipy.fft.dct

### Official scipy.fft.dct Documentation
The scipy documentation states that `scipy.fft.dct` computes the Discrete Cosine Transform of arbitrary type sequence x. The function supports 4 types of DCT (type 1, 2, 3, and 4), with type 2 being the default.

Key points from the scipy documentation:
- The function accepts an array_like input `x`
- The `type` parameter can be {1, 2, 3, 4}
- The documentation states that Type I "only supports input sizes > 1"
- There is no explicit statement about what happens when a single-element array is passed to Type 1

### Mathematical Definition from Wikipedia
According to the Wikipedia article on Discrete Cosine Transform:
- DCT-I is "not defined for N less than 2"
- This is a mathematical constraint, not just an implementation detail
- The DCT-I formula requires at least 2 points because it involves boundary conditions at both n=0 and n=N-1
- All other DCT types (2, 3, 4) are defined for any positive N, including N=1

### Key Finding
The documentation from both scipy and the mathematical definition clearly indicate that DCT Type 1 is not defined for single-element arrays (N=1). The scipy documentation explicitly states "Type I only supports input sizes > 1", and the mathematical definition confirms this is a fundamental mathematical constraint, not an implementation choice.

### Comparison with Other Types
DCT Types 2, 3, and 4 are all mathematically defined for single-element arrays, which explains why they work correctly with single-element inputs in scipy.

### Conclusion from Documentation
Based on the documentation alone, the RuntimeError when passing a single-element array to DCT Type 1 appears to be the correct behavior, not a bug. The function is behaving as documented - DCT Type 1 requires input size > 1.
