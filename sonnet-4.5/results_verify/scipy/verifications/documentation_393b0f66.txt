## Documentation Analysis

### Method Documentation

The set_iprint method's docstring (lines 1011-1034 in _odrpack.py) documents that:

1. **Valid parameter values**:
   - init, iter, final: Can be 0 (no report), 1 (short report), or 2 (long report)
   - so_init, so_iter, so_final: Same values (0, 1, or 2) for stdout output
   - iter_step: 0-9 for iteration report frequency

2. **Constraints mentioned**:
   - If rptfile is None, so_* arguments will raise an exception
   - Cannot specify stdout output only (need a rptfile for that)

3. **What's NOT documented**:
   - No mention that certain combinations of init/so_init are invalid
   - No warning that [0,1] or [0,2] combinations will fail
   - No explanation of the internal ip2arg lookup table limitations

### Logic Analysis

The code at lines 1062-1073 allows users to set:
- init to 0 (no file report)
- so_init to 1 or 2 (short or long stdout report)

This creates combinations [0,1] and [0,2] which represent:
- [0,1]: No report to file, short report to stdout
- [0,2]: No report to file, long report to stdout

These seem semantically valid - a user might want console output without file output.

### Documentation vs Implementation Gap

The documentation states you can set init=0 and so_init=1 or 2, but the implementation's ip2arg lookup table (lines 1045-1051) doesn't include these combinations. The table only has 7 combinations when mathematically there should be 9 (3x3 matrix).

The missing combinations are:
- [0,1]: none to file, short to stdout
- [0,2]: none to file, long to stdout

### Conclusion

The documentation does not indicate these combinations are invalid. The docstring explicitly says init can be 0 and so_init can be 1 or 2, with no warning about incompatible combinations. This is a clear gap between documented behavior and implementation.
