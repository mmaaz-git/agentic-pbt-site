REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

## Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test fails as expected. When running the test with various values of n (from 2 to 20), ALL cases raise TypeError instead of the expected ValueError. The error message is consistently:
"TypeError: str.format() argument after * must be an iterable, not float"

## Direct Test Results
When testing with the provided example code:
```python
mat = np.array([[5.0, 1.0], [1.0, 5.0]])
is_valid_dm(mat, tol=0.1, throw=True, name=None)
```

Result: TypeError with message "str.format() argument after * must be an iterable, not float"

## Comparison Test
I also tested with name='test' to verify the behavior difference:
- With name='test': Correctly raises ValueError with message "Distance matrix 'test' diagonal must be close to zero within tolerance 0.10000."
- With name=None: Incorrectly raises TypeError due to malformed string formatting

## Root Cause Verification
Examining the source code at lines 2610-2611 of distance.py confirms the bug:
```python
raise ValueError(('Distance matrix \'{}\' diagonal must be close '
                  'to zero within tolerance {:5.5f}.').format(*tol))
```

The issue is the use of `*tol` (unpacking operator) when `tol` is a float. The asterisk operator attempts to unpack `tol` as if it were an iterable, but since it's a float, this causes a TypeError.

The bug is 100% reproducible and occurs exactly as described in the report.
