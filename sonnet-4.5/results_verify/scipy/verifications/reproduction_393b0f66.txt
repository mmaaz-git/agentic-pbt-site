## Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the bug report. Here are the findings:

### Property-Based Test Results

The hypothesis test was able to find multiple failing cases. The test confirmed that the following combinations cause `ValueError: [X, Y] is not in list`:
- init=0, so_init=1 (the exact case reported)
- init=0, so_init=2

These errors occur regardless of the values of iter, final, and iter_step parameters.

### Minimal Example Results

The minimal example provided in the bug report executes exactly as described:
- Created an ODR object with simple linear data
- Called `odr_obj.set_iprint(init=0, so_init=1)`
- Got the exact error: `ValueError: [0, 1] is not in list`

### Error Analysis

The error occurs when the method tries to look up a combination [0, 1] or [0, 2] in the ip2arg list. The traceback shows it fails at:
```python
File "/home/npc/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/odr/_odrpack.py", line 1079, in set_iprint
    ip[0] = ip2arg.index(iprint_l[0:2])
```

This confirms that:
1. The bug is real and reproducible
2. It affects multiple combinations of valid inputs (not just [0, 1])
3. The error message matches exactly what the bug report states
4. The crash happens in the exact location (line 1079) that the report identifies

The bug report's diagnosis appears accurate: the ip2arg lookup table is missing certain valid combinations that can be created by the method's logic.
