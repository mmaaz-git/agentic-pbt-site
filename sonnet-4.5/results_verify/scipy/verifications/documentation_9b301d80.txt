## Documentation Analysis for RotationSpline

### Official Documentation Review

I reviewed the scipy.spatial.transform.RotationSpline documentation from both the official docs and inline help. Here are the key findings:

#### Documented Requirements
1. **times parameter**:
   - Must be array-like, shape (N,)
   - "At least 2 times must be specified"
   - Values must be in "strictly increasing order" (enforced with error check)
   - No documented minimum spacing requirement between time points

2. **rotations parameter**:
   - Must be a Rotation instance with N rotations
   - Must contain at least 2 rotations

#### Mathematical Description
- "The rotation vectors between each consecutive orientation are cubic functions of time"
- "Angular rate and acceleration are continuous"
- References a specific paper for implementation details

#### Error Handling
The documentation does NOT mention:
- Numerical stability issues with closely-spaced time points
- Potential for overflow errors during construction
- Possibility of zero-norm quaternion errors during evaluation
- Any recommended minimum spacing between time points
- Any warnings about numerical limitations

#### Example Usage
The provided example uses time points `[0, 10, 20, 40]` which are well-spaced, avoiding any numerical issues. There are no examples demonstrating edge cases or numerical limitations.

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation fails to warn users about:
1. **Numerical stability requirements**: No mention that very small time intervals can cause numerical instability
2. **Failure modes**: No documentation of potential ValueError exceptions beyond basic input validation
3. **Best practices**: No guidance on minimum recommended time spacing
4. **Silent failures**: No warning that construction can succeed but evaluation may fail

### Conclusion

The documentation is incomplete regarding numerical stability requirements. Users following the documented requirements exactly (providing strictly increasing time points with at least 2 values) can still encounter unexpected failures. The lack of documentation about numerical limitations means users have no way to predict or prevent these errors based on the documentation alone.
