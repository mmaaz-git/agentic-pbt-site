DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## scipy.io.loadmat Documentation

The loadmat function documentation explicitly states:

1. **struct_as_record parameter**: "The default setting is True, because it allows easier round-trip load and save of MATLAB files."
   - This is a clear promise that the default settings should enable round-trip operations
   - The word "easier" implies that round-trips should work correctly

2. **chars_as_strings parameter**: "Whether to convert char arrays to string arrays."
   - The documentation describes what this does but doesn't warn about dimension changes
   - No mention that chars_as_strings=False could cause non-idempotent behavior

3. **matlab_compatible parameter**: Sets multiple options to match MATLAB's loading behavior
   - Includes chars_as_strings=False as part of MATLAB compatibility
   - Suggests this should properly handle MATLAB character arrays

## scipy.io.savemat Documentation

The savemat documentation:
- Does not mention any special handling for character arrays that were previously loaded
- Does not warn about potential dimension changes during round-trips
- Does not describe how it handles numpy arrays that represent MATLAB character data

## MATLAB Documentation

From the MATLAB documentation:
- Character arrays are a fundamental data type in MATLAB
- MATLAB distinguishes between character arrays (using single quotes) and string arrays (using double quotes)
- Character arrays are expected to maintain consistent dimensions when saved and loaded

## Documentation Gap

The documentation does NOT:
1. Warn users that chars_as_strings=False can cause dimension changes on round-trips
2. Explain that character arrays loaded from MATLAB files may gain dimensions on subsequent saves
3. Provide guidance on how to maintain dimension stability when working with character data
4. Clarify that "easier round-trip" only applies to certain parameter combinations

## Conclusion

The documentation clearly promises "easier round-trip load and save" as a benefit of the default settings. While chars_as_strings=False is not the default, it is a documented parameter that users would reasonably expect to work correctly for round-trips. The documentation does not warn about or explain the dimension-changing behavior, making this unexpected behavior that violates the documented promise of round-trip support.
