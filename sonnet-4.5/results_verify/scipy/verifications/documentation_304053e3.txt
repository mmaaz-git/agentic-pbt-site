## Documentation Analysis

### Official scipy.io Documentation

1. **hb_write Function**
   - Purpose: "Writes a sparse array or matrix to a Harwell-Boeing (HB) format file"
   - Supports: "assembled, non-symmetric, real matrices"
   - Uses: "Integer pointer/indices" and "Exponential format for float values"
   - Example shows writing and reading should preserve data

2. **hb_read Function**
   - Purpose: "Read Harwell-Boeing format matrix files"
   - Returns: "A sparse matrix/array in Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) format"
   - Documentation explicitly states it's designed for round-tripping with hb_write()
   - Example demonstrates: write a sparse array, then read it back

### Round-Trip Guarantee
The documentation examples explicitly demonstrate round-tripping:
```python
>>> data = csr_array(eye(3))  # create a sparse array
>>> hb_write("data.hb", data)  # write a hb file
>>> hb_read("data.hb", spmatrix=False)  # read it back
```

This establishes that **round-trip behavior is an expected feature** of these functions.

### Harwell-Boeing Format Specifications

1. **Format Standard (from NIST and other sources)**
   - Uses 80-column fixed-length format for portability
   - Line 4 specifies Fortran formats for data blocks (e.g., E24.16)
   - Data should be formatted according to Fortran conventions

2. **Fortran E24.16 Format**
   - E24.16 means: 24 total characters width, 16 decimal places
   - Should produce fields exactly 24 characters wide
   - Values should be right-justified with leading spaces if needed
   - Multiple values should be properly spaced within their field widths

3. **Test Suite Evidence**
   - scipy's own test suite (test_hb.py) includes round-trip tests
   - The TestHBReadWrite class has check_save_load() method that verifies round-tripping
   - This confirms round-trip behavior is not just documented but actively tested

### Conclusion
The documentation and test suite establish that:
1. Round-trip behavior (write then read) is an explicitly supported feature
2. The functions should handle any valid sparse matrix data
3. The Harwell-Boeing format requires proper field width formatting (24 chars for E24.16)
4. The current implementation violates the format specification by producing 23-char fields
