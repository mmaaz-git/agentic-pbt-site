Documentation Review for scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.has_canonical_format

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION ON has_canonical_format:
   - The scipy.sparse.coo_matrix documentation defines canonical format as:
     * "Entries and coordinates sorted by row, then column"
     * "No duplicate entries (i.e. duplicate (i,j) locations)"
     * "Data arrays MAY have explicit zeros"
   - The has_canonical_format is a boolean attribute that indicates whether the matrix meets these requirements

2. DOCUMENTATION ON sum_duplicates():
   - The sum_duplicates() method is documented as an "in place" operation
   - It "eliminate[s] duplicate entries by adding them together"
   - No explicit documentation about setting has_canonical_format flag
   - No warnings about the flag becoming stale after direct array modification

3. GENERAL SPARSE MATRIX DOCUMENTATION:
   - The documentation does mention that "Directly modifying data/index arrays can break internal consistency"
   - However, this is a general guideline without specific reference to has_canonical_format
   - No explicit contract or API guarantee about flag invalidation
   - No documentation states that the arrays are read-only or should not be modified

4. WHAT IS NOT DOCUMENTED:
   - There is NO explicit documentation stating that has_canonical_format should be invalidated when arrays are modified
   - There is NO documentation that arrays become read-only after sum_duplicates()
   - There is NO explicit contract about maintaining consistency between the flag and actual data state
   - There is NO warning that direct modification of arrays will not update the flag

5. DESIGN INTENT:
   - The documentation suggests that sparse matrices are designed to allow direct array access
   - The data, row, and col attributes are publicly accessible (not prefixed with _)
   - No documentation suggests these arrays should be immutable or protected

CONCLUSION FROM DOCUMENTATION:
The documentation does not explicitly specify what should happen to has_canonical_format when the underlying arrays are modified directly. There is no documented contract that the flag must be invalidated upon array modification. The behavior is essentially unspecified.
