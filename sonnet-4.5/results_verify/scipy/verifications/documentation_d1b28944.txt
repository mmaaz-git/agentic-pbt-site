Documentation Findings for scipy.datasets._download_all

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION:
- The scipy.datasets.download_all() function documentation states it's a utility method to download all dataset files
- The function accepts an optional path parameter; if None, defaults to system cache_dir detected by pooch
- The documentation mentions that pooch is used for dataset management but does not explicitly state it's a required dependency
- No documentation was found about specific error handling when pooch is not installed

2. SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION:
The _download_all.py file itself contains a docstring at the top stating:
"""
Platform independent script to download all the
`scipy.datasets` module data files.
This doesn't require a full scipy build.

Run: python _download_all.py <download_dir>
"""

This clearly indicates the file is meant to be run as a standalone script with the command: python _download_all.py <download_dir>

3. FUNCTION-LEVEL DOCUMENTATION:
The download_all() function has proper documentation that:
- Describes the function purpose
- Documents the path parameter
- Provides usage examples
- BUT does not mention that pooch is a required dependency or what happens when it's missing

4. ERROR HANDLING DESIGN:
The code shows intentional error handling design:
- Lines 10-13: Try to import pooch, set to None if ImportError
- Lines 47-50: Check if pooch is None and raise a helpful ImportError with installation instructions
- This shows the developers intended to provide helpful error messages when pooch is missing

5. SCRIPT USAGE CONTEXT:
Based on web search results, this script is specifically designed for:
- SciPy packagers (e.g., Linux distributions)
- Situations where external downloads at build time are forbidden
- Pre-downloading all SciPy dataset files without requiring the full scipy build

The script is not just an internal implementation detail but a tool explicitly documented for standalone usage by packagers and maintainers.
