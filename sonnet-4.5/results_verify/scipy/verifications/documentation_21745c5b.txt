DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Based on my review of the pandas documentation and help text:

1. Official Documentation for split():
   - Signature: Series.str.split(pat=None, *, n=-1, expand=False, regex=None)
   - The regex parameter was added in pandas 1.4.0 (as noted in the docstring)
   - regex parameter controls whether pat is interpreted as a regular expression:
     * None (default): Single-char patterns treated as literal, multi-char as regex
     * True: Always treat pattern as regex
     * False: Always treat pattern as literal string
   - Documentation explicitly describes this parameter and its behavior

2. Official Documentation for rsplit():
   - Signature: Series.str.rsplit(pat=None, *, n=-1, expand=False)
   - NO regex parameter is documented
   - The method is described as "Split strings around given separator/delimiter" from the end
   - Documentation references it as a counterpart to split(), stating it "Splits the string in the Series/Index from the end"
   - The See Also section explicitly references split() as the related method

3. Relationship Between Methods:
   - Both methods are documented as string splitting operations
   - rsplit() is presented as the right-side equivalent of split()
   - The documentation describes them as related/mirror operations
   - However, the documentation does NOT promise identical parameter sets

4. Key Finding:
   - The documentation accurately reflects the current implementation
   - There is no documentation claiming rsplit() should have a regex parameter
   - The absence of the regex parameter in rsplit() is not a documentation error
   - The documentation correctly describes what each method currently supports

5. API Design Consideration:
   - While split() and rsplit() are conceptually mirror operations, the documentation does not guarantee they must have identical parameters
   - The regex parameter was added to split() in version 1.4.0 but was not added to rsplit()
   - This appears to be an intentional or overlooked design decision rather than a bug

Conclusion: The documentation accurately describes the current state of both methods. The lack of regex parameter in rsplit() is not contradicted by any documentation.
