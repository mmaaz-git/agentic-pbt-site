## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review
I reviewed the official scipy documentation for `spsolve_triangular` at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve_triangular.html

#### What the documentation says:
1. **Input type for A**: "A sparse square triangular matrix" of type "(M, M) sparse array or matrix" in CSR or CSC format
2. **No mention of index dtype restrictions**: The documentation does NOT specify any restrictions on the dtype of indices or indptr arrays
3. **Example uses float dtype** for the data array but doesn't discuss index types

#### What the documentation DOESN'T say:
- No mention that indices must be int32/cint
- No warning about int64 incompatibility
- No guidance on index dtype requirements
- No mention of differences from other sparse functions

### Documentation vs Reality Gap
1. **Implicit assumptions**: The function assumes int32 indices but this is never documented
2. **API inconsistency**: Other functions like `spsolve` and `splu` accept int64, creating an inconsistent API surface
3. **Default behavior mismatch**: The natural way to create sparse matrices (from coordinate format) produces int64 indices by default, which is incompatible with this function

### Comparison with Similar Functions
- `spsolve` documentation: Also doesn't specify index dtype requirements, but works with int64
- `splu` documentation: Same situation - no specification but works with int64
- This creates an expectation that sparse functions should handle both int32 and int64

### Error Message Analysis
The error message "row indices and column pointers must be of type cint" is problematic:
- "cint" is not a standard NumPy dtype that users would recognize
- It's a C-level implementation detail leaking into user-facing error messages
- Users cannot directly create "cint" arrays - they need to know this means np.int32

### Conclusion
The documentation fails to communicate a critical requirement of the function. Users following standard scipy.sparse patterns will encounter this undocumented restriction and receive an unclear error message. This is either a bug in the implementation (should accept int64) or a documentation bug (should document the restriction).
