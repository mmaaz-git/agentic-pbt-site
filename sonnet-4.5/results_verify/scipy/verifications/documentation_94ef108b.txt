## Documentation Findings for scipy.differentiate.derivative

### Official Documentation Analysis

From the official SciPy documentation and source code docstring, I found the following information about the `initial_step` parameter:

1. **Parameter Description:**
   - `initial_step` is described as "The (absolute) initial step size for the finite difference derivative approximation"
   - Default value: 0.5
   - Type: float or array_like

2. **Constraints Mentioned:**
   - The documentation states that step sizes are "absolute"
   - Notes mention that for large x values (e.g., 1e20), the default 0.5 may not provide sufficient precision
   - Recommends using larger initial step sizes for large magnitudes of x
   - No explicit requirement that initial_step must be positive is stated

3. **Related Parameter Validation:**
   - The documentation shows that `step_factor` must be non-negative (line 27-33 in source)
   - Error message for tolerances states: "Tolerances and step parameters must be non-negative scalars"
   - However, this validation only checks `step_factor`, not `initial_step`

4. **Behavior for Invalid Values:**
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly state what happens when initial_step is zero or negative
   - Return status -3 is documented as "A non-finite value was encountered" but doesn't specify this could be from invalid input

5. **Source Code Finding:**
   - Line 408 in _differentiate.py: `h0 = xpx.at(h0)[h0 <= 0].set(xp.nan)`
   - This line explicitly sets initial_step (h0) to NaN when it is <= 0
   - This is done silently without raising an error

### Key Documentation Gaps:

1. The documentation does not explicitly state that initial_step must be positive
2. The documentation does not describe what happens when initial_step is non-positive
3. The error status -3 documentation doesn't clarify it can result from invalid initial_step values
4. There is an inconsistency: step_factor is validated and raises an error if negative, but initial_step is silently converted to NaN

### Conclusion:

The documentation is incomplete regarding the constraints on initial_step. While it's reasonable to assume from context (absolute step size for numerical differentiation) that it should be positive, this requirement is not explicitly documented. The silent conversion to NaN rather than raising an error appears intentional in the code but is not documented behavior.
