## Documentation Analysis

### SciPy Documentation Review

From the official SciPy documentation for jensenshannon:

1. **Normalization claim**: The docstring explicitly states "This routine will normalize `p` and `q` if they don't sum to 1.0."

2. **Input requirements**: The documentation describes inputs as "probability vectors" or "probability arrays" but does not explicitly state requirements about non-zero values or handling of degenerate cases.

3. **Identity property**: The documentation includes an example showing jensenshannon([1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]) = 0.0, confirming the identity property should hold.

4. **No mention of edge cases**: The documentation does not mention what happens with all-zero inputs or how the function handles division by zero during normalization.

### Mathematical Foundation

From mathematical sources (Wikipedia, academic references):

1. **Probability distribution requirement**: Jensen-Shannon divergence is mathematically defined for probability distributions, which by definition must be non-negative and sum to 1. An all-zero vector does not satisfy this requirement.

2. **Advantages over KL divergence**: One documented advantage of JS divergence is its ability to "handle zero probabilities" better than KL divergence - but this refers to individual zero entries in valid distributions, not all-zero vectors.

3. **Identity property**: The mathematical definition guarantees JS(P,P) = 0 for any valid probability distribution P.

### Related Issues in SciPy

GitHub issues show this is not an isolated problem:
- Issue #19436: Reports edge cases where jensenshannon returns inf
- Issue #20083: Reports cases where jensenshannon returns NaN due to numerical precision

### Key Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation does not specify what constitutes a valid input beyond calling them "probability vectors"
2. No mention of behavior with all-zero inputs or degenerate cases
3. The normalization promise ("will normalize p and q if they don't sum to 1.0") is incomplete - it doesn't specify what happens when the sum is 0
4. No error handling specifications for invalid inputs

### Conclusion

The documentation is ambiguous about handling edge cases. While it promises normalization for non-unit sum vectors, it doesn't specify behavior for zero-sum vectors. The mathematical foundation suggests all-zero vectors are not valid probability distributions, but the function accepts them without validation, leading to undefined behavior (NaN) rather than a clear error.
