DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
=====================

CURRENT DOCUMENTATION STATE:

1. Function Docstring (scipy.optimize.cython_optimize._zeros.full_output_example):
   ```
   Parameters
   ----------
   args : sequence of float
       extra arguments of zero function
   ...

   This example finds the roots of a 3rd order polynomial with coefficients
   given as `args`.
   ```

2. Module Documentation (scipy.optimize.cython_optimize):
   - Shows examples of using custom callbacks with user-defined structs
   - Does not document the built-in polynomial example functions
   - No mention of coefficient ordering for polynomial functions

DOCUMENTATION DEFICIENCIES:

1. CRITICAL OMISSION - Coefficient Order:
   - The docstring mentions "3rd order polynomial with coefficients"
   - It does NOT specify the polynomial form (c0 + c1*x + c2*x^2 + c3*x^3)
   - It does NOT specify coefficients are in ascending order of powers
   - This is contrary to standard mathematical convention (descending order)

2. VAGUE PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
   - "extra arguments of zero function" is extremely vague
   - For a polynomial solver, these aren't just "extra arguments"
   - They are the polynomial coefficients with specific ordering requirements

3. NO USAGE EXAMPLES:
   - The docstring provides no examples showing correct usage
   - No demonstration of how to pass coefficients for common polynomials
   - Users must guess or reverse-engineer the correct format

4. INCONSISTENCY WITH MATHEMATICAL CONVENTIONS:
   - Most mathematical texts write polynomials as: ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + z
   - NumPy's polynomial functions typically use descending order
   - This function uses ascending order without documenting this deviation

5. NO WARNING ABOUT ORDER SENSITIVITY:
   - The function silently accepts coefficients in any order
   - Returns incorrect results if wrong order is used
   - No validation or error checking for reasonable polynomial values

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is insufficient and misleading. It mentions the function works with polynomial coefficients but fails to document the critical detail of coefficient ordering, leading to incorrect usage and wrong results. This is a documentation bug, not a code bug - the code works correctly when used properly, but users cannot determine proper usage from the documentation.
