## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The code works as designed according to the source code mapping. The window name mapping explicitly lists 'kaiser bessel derived' (with spaces) and 'kbd' as the valid identifiers, and nowhere does it promise that function names would work as identifiers. The documentation doesn't explicitly state that underscore versions should work, and the behavior is consistent with the implemented mapping table.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
This is a clear inconsistency in the API. Every other window function with underscores in its name (general_gaussian, general_cosine, general_hamming) accepts both the underscore and space versions. Users reasonably expect that the function name they see in documentation and autocomplete would work as an identifier. The error message "Unknown window type" is misleading when kaiser_bessel_derived clearly exists as a function.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The issue might be considered minor since workarounds exist ('kbd' and 'kaiser bessel derived' both work). The current behavior has likely been in place for years, and changing it might be seen as unnecessary churn. The 'kbd' alias is short and convenient, arguably better than typing the full underscore version.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This inconsistency violates the principle of least surprise and creates unnecessary friction for users. It's the only window function that behaves this way, making the API inconsistent. The fix is trivial (just add one string to a tuple) and backwards-compatible. This is not an obscure edge case - users naturally try the function name they see in documentation.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't clearly specify which string identifiers are valid for each window type. It could be argued that the documentation should explicitly list the valid string forms for get_window rather than leaving users to discover them through trial and error. Adding documentation that states "use 'kaiser bessel derived' or 'kbd' for kaiser_bessel_derived windows" would prevent confusion.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
While the documentation could be clearer, the fundamental issue is an inconsistency in the code itself. Other window functions with underscores work with their function names, creating a reasonable expectation that kaiser_bessel_derived should too. Documenting an inconsistency doesn't fix the underlying API design issue.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that supporting function names as identifiers is a new feature that was never promised. The current system works with specific string mappings, and adding underscore support for kaiser_bessel_derived would be extending functionality rather than fixing broken behavior.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but for consistency with existing behavior. Other window functions already support their function names as identifiers. This is about fixing an inconsistency, not adding a new capability. The expected behavior already exists for similar functions.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
This is a clear API inconsistency where kaiser_bessel_derived behaves differently from all other window functions with underscores. Users have a reasonable expectation based on the behavior of general_gaussian, general_cosine, and general_hamming that function names should work as identifiers. The inconsistency causes confusion and violates the principle of least surprise. The fix is trivial and backwards-compatible.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The code is working exactly as implemented in the source mapping table. There's no promise in the documentation that function names should work as identifiers. The function is accessible through two working identifiers ('kaiser bessel derived' and 'kbd'). This could be seen as a design choice rather than a bug, even if it's inconsistent.

## Overall consideration

Looking at the evidence, this issue sits at the intersection of several categories. The code is technically working as implemented, but there's a clear inconsistency in the API design. The key question is whether this inconsistency rises to the level of a bug or is merely an unfortunate design quirk.

The strongest argument for this being a BUG is the inconsistency with other similarly-named functions. When general_gaussian, general_cosine, and general_hamming all accept both underscore and space versions, it creates a strong expectation that kaiser_bessel_derived should behave the same way. This isn't about undocumented behavior - it's about consistency within the API itself. Users discovering functions through autocomplete or documentation will naturally try the function name they see.

However, the fact that the code is working exactly as the source code mapping specifies, combined with the existence of working alternatives ('kbd' is even shorter than the full name), suggests this might better be classified as a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The documentation could explicitly clarify the valid string identifiers for each window type, preventing user confusion without changing the existing behavior. Given that this has likely been the behavior for years and there are working alternatives, the maintainers might reasonably decide this isn't worth changing, especially if they're concerned about backwards compatibility or code stability.
