## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG:
**Strong evidence for BUG:**
- The code crashes with an unhelpful AttributeError instead of the intended ImportError with clear instructions
- There is already proper error handling in download_all() (lines 47-50) that never gets reached
- The error message pattern is consistent across the codebase, showing clear intent for how this should work
- The crash happens during argparse setup, preventing the intended error handling from executing
- This affects usability when running as a script: `python _download_all.py`

### Considering INVALID:
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The code clearly intends to handle missing pooch gracefully (explicit try/except ImportError)
- The error type matters here - AttributeError is confusing compared to the intended ImportError
- The existing error message is much clearer: "Missing optional dependency 'pooch' required for scipy.datasets module. Please use pip or conda to install 'pooch'."

### Considering WONTFIX:
**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - running the script without pooch installed is a reasonable scenario
- The fix is simple and improves user experience significantly
- The error message difference is substantial (cryptic AttributeError vs clear ImportError with installation instructions)
- This affects the primary use case of the script (downloading datasets)

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is clearly wrong, not just poorly documented
- The implementation already has the correct error handling that just doesn't get reached
- While documentation could be clearer about pooch being optional, the bug is in the code execution

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is not a request for new functionality
- The proper error handling already exists in the code but is bypassed due to premature evaluation
- The code clearly intends to handle this case gracefully (evident from the try/except block and error message)

### Verdict: BUG

This is clearly a bug because:
1. The code has explicit error handling for missing pooch that is bypassed due to premature evaluation
2. Users receive a cryptic AttributeError instead of the intended clear ImportError with installation instructions
3. The fix is straightforward - defer the pooch.os_cache() call until after argument parsing
4. The behavior contradicts the clear intent of the code (graceful handling of optional dependency)
