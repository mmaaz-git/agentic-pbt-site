TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against five possible categorizations:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE INVALID:
   - The documentation explicitly states round-trip only works for odd-length sequences
   - The reported behavior (failing for length-2) is documented and expected
   - The bug reporter incorrectly assumes round-trip should work for all sequences
   - The test is asserting behavior that was never promised by the API

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE INVALID:
   - The behavior is counterintuitive and could be seen as a limitation
   - Similar functions in other libraries might handle this differently

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE WONTFIX:
   - This is an edge case for length-2 arrays which are rarely used in practice
   - The mathematical theory behind these transforms may inherently require this limitation
   - Fixing it might break backward compatibility or mathematical correctness

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE WONTFIX:
   - Information loss is a serious issue in signal processing
   - The bug report shows it affects a basic use case (simple 2-element arrays)

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The user wants round-trip for even-length arrays, which isn't currently supported
   - This would be adding new functionality beyond the documented API contract
   - The request is for enhanced invertibility that wasn't originally designed

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The user frames it as a bug, not a new feature
   - They compare it to a "known issue" with hilbert/ihilbert

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation needs clarification)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - Users might not notice the "odd-length only" constraint in the docs
   - The documentation could be more prominent about this limitation
   - Examples could show the failure case for even-length arrays

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation is already clear: "n = len(x) is odd"
   - The mathematical constraint is explicitly stated

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE A BUG:
   - Complete information loss (returning all zeros) seems severe
   - The user mentions this is similar to a "known issue" with hilbert/ihilbert
   - Round-trip operations are typically expected to preserve information

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE A BUG:
   - The behavior exactly matches the documented specification
   - The documentation never claims even-length arrays should round-trip
   - This appears to be a mathematical/theoretical limitation, not an implementation error

ANALYSIS CONCLUSION:
The strongest case is for INVALID because:
1. The documentation explicitly states the limitation to odd-length sequences
2. The observed behavior exactly matches the documented behavior
3. The bug report's core assumption (that round-trip should work for even-length) contradicts the documentation
4. The test is asserting undocumented behavior

Secondary consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST if we're being generous, as the user wants functionality (even-length round-trip) that isn't currently supported. However, since they frame it as a bug rather than requesting new functionality, INVALID is more appropriate.
