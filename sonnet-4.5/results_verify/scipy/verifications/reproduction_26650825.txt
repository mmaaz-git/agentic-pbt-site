# Reproduction Analysis

## Bug Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: Successfully reproduced the bug. The test failed with a similar example:
   - Input: y=1.0, lmbda=4.7106300468537345e-216
   - Result: Round-trip failed with y_recovered=0.6931471805599453 (which equals log(2))
   - Expected: 1.0
   - Error: ~0.307

2. **Specific Example from Bug Report**: Exactly reproduced as claimed:
   - Input: y=1.0, lmbda=5.808166112732823e-234
   - inv_boxcox1p(1.0, lmbda) = 1.0
   - boxcox1p(1.0, lmbda) = 0.6931471805599453 (confirmed to equal log(2))
   - Error: 0.3068528194400547

3. **Threshold Analysis**: Identified the exact threshold where behavior changes:
   - For lambda >= 1e-156: Functions work correctly (round-trip succeeds)
   - For lambda < 1e-157: Functions become inconsistent (round-trip fails)
   - The failure consistently produces log(2) ≈ 0.693147 when expected value is 1.0

### Bug Mechanism

The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of very small lambda values:

1. When lambda < ~1e-157:
   - `inv_boxcox1p(1.0, lambda)` returns 1.0 (appears to use lambda=0 case: exp(y) - 1 = exp(1) - 1 ≈ 1.718 for general case, but somehow returns 1.0)
   - `boxcox1p(1.0, lambda)` returns log(2) ≈ 0.693 (uses lambda=0 case: log(1+x) = log(2))

2. When lambda >= ~1e-156:
   - Both functions use the general formula consistently
   - Round-trip works correctly with error near machine precision

### Impact

The bug causes a significant error (>30%) in round-trip operations for very small lambda values. While these are extreme values, the documentation explicitly states that inv_boxcox1p is the inverse of boxcox1p, making this a violation of the documented contract.
