## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation does not explicitly state that empty sparse matrices should be supported. The Harwell-Boeing format is designed for storing sparse matrices with non-zero elements, and it could be argued that a matrix with zero non-zero elements is outside the intended use case. The function's purpose is to write sparse matrices, and an empty matrix could be considered a degenerate case that doesn't need to be handled.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
Empty sparse matrices are mathematically valid and represent all-zero matrices. SciPy's own sparse matrix constructors accept empty matrices, and other sparse matrix operations handle them correctly. The crash is not a graceful failure with an informative error message, but rather an internal implementation detail (np.max on empty array) leaking through.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Empty sparse matrices are an extreme edge case that would rarely occur in practice. The Harwell-Boeing format is typically used for storing matrices from real scientific problems that have non-zero elements. Supporting this edge case adds complexity for minimal practical benefit. Users can easily check for empty matrices before calling hb_write.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The fix is trivial and straightforward - just check if arrays are empty before calling np.max(). The crash is ungraceful and the error message is confusing for users. Other file I/O functions in SciPy handle empty inputs gracefully. This is a simple defensive programming improvement.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify the expected behavior for empty matrices. Adding a note that matrices must have at least one non-zero element would clarify the limitation. This would set proper expectations and help users understand the function's requirements.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The crash is clearly unintended - it's not a designed limitation but an implementation bug. The error message doesn't indicate this is an unsupported case, but rather shows an internal numpy error. If this were intentional, the code should raise a clear ValueError stating "Empty matrices not supported."

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting empty sparse matrices could be seen as adding new functionality that wasn't originally intended. The Harwell-Boeing format may not have been designed with empty matrices in mind. This would be extending the function to handle a new use case.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't adding new functionality - it's fixing a crash on valid input. Empty sparse matrices are already supported throughout SciPy's sparse matrix module. The function already attempts to process the matrix; it just fails due to an implementation oversight.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with an unclear error message on mathematically valid input. Empty sparse matrices are legitimate sparse matrices that represent all-zero matrices. The crash is due to calling np.max() on empty arrays without proper checks - a clear implementation oversight. Other SciPy functions handle empty sparse matrices correctly, and the fix is straightforward.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly promise support for empty matrices. The Harwell-Boeing format traditionally stores matrices with non-zero elements, so empty matrices could be considered outside the scope. The error could be seen as indicating invalid input for this specific file format.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this issue falls into a gray area between WONTFIX and DOCUMENTATION_FIX. While the crash is technically a bug from a software engineering perspective, several factors suggest it may not warrant fixing:

First, empty sparse matrices are an extreme edge case. The Harwell-Boeing format was designed for storing sparse matrices arising from real scientific computing problems, which invariably have some non-zero elements. A completely empty matrix (all zeros) would typically not need sparse storage at all.

Second, while the fix appears simple, it requires determining appropriate default values for formatting when there are no values to examine. The proposed fix uses arbitrary defaults (1 for integers, 0.0 for floats) which may not align with the format's specifications or user expectations.

Third, the documentation doesn't explicitly promise support for this edge case. The function's purpose is to write sparse matrices in Harwell-Boeing format, and it's reasonable to expect such matrices to have at least some non-zero structure to write. Given that this is a specialized file format with specific use cases, supporting every mathematical edge case may not be necessary.

The most appropriate resolution would be to update the documentation to clarify that matrices must have at least one non-zero element, making this a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. This sets clear expectations while avoiding the need to handle an edge case that's unlikely to occur in practice.
