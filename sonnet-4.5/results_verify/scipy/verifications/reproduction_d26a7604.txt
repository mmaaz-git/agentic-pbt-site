# Reproduction Analysis

## Bug Reproduction Confirmed

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The bug is real and occurs exactly as described.

### Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test fails when given all-zero arrays. The test expects the Bray-Curtis distance to be between 0.0 and 1.0, but when both input arrays contain only zeros, the function returns `nan`.

Specific failing inputs observed:
- `u=[0.0], v=[0.0]` -> returns `nan`
- `u=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], v=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]` -> returns `nan`

### Direct Reproduction Results
Running the exact reproduction code from the bug report confirms:
1. `braycurtis([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0])` returns `nan` instead of the expected `0.0`
2. A RuntimeWarning is raised: "invalid value encountered in scalar divide"
3. The assertion `assert result == 0.0` fails because the result is `nan`

### Additional Test Cases
To understand the scope of the issue, I tested additional cases:
- `braycurtis([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])` correctly returns `0.0` (identical non-zero vectors)
- `braycurtis([1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0])` correctly returns `1.0` (completely different vectors)

### Root Cause
The bug occurs because when both input arrays are all zeros:
1. The numerator (sum of absolute differences) becomes 0
2. The denominator (sum of absolute sums) also becomes 0
3. This results in 0/0 division, which produces `nan` in numpy

### Impact
This violates a fundamental property of distance metrics: d(x, x) = 0 for any vector x. The Bray-Curtis distance should return 0 when comparing identical vectors, even if those vectors are all zeros.
