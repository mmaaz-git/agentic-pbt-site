BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT

Test Setup:
- scipy.sparse.csgraph.laplacian with form='lo' to return LinearOperator
- Simple 2x2 symmetric graph matrix: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- Test vector: [1.0, 2.0]

Reproduction Results:

1. Simple Test Case (from bug report):
   - Created LinearOperator with csgraph.laplacian(graph, form='lo')
   - Attempted lap_lo @ test_vec where test_vec has shape (2,)
   - RESULT: ValueError: cannot reshape array of size 4 into shape (2,)
   - The error matches the bug report exactly

2. Comparison with form='array':
   - Same graph with form='array' works correctly
   - lap_array @ test_vec returns [-1., 1.] with shape (2,)
   - This demonstrates the expected behavior

3. Direct matvec Method Test:
   - lap_lo.matvec(test_vec) also fails with same error
   - This confirms the issue is in the matvec implementation

4. 2D Input Test (matmat):
   - lap_lo @ test_mat where test_mat has shape (2, 1)
   - Works correctly, returns [[-1.], [1.]] with shape (2, 1)
   - This shows matmat functionality is working

5. Root Cause Analysis:
   - The lambda function uses: v * d[:, np.newaxis] - m @ v
   - When v is 1D (shape (2,)), v * d[:, np.newaxis] produces shape (2, 2)
   - When v is 2D (shape (2, 1)), v * d[:, np.newaxis] produces shape (2, 1)
   - The LinearOperator wrapper expects matvec to return 1D for 1D input

6. Property-Based Test:
   - Hypothesis test fails immediately on first example
   - Confirms the bug occurs for all cases with form='lo' and 1D vectors
   - The test correctly identifies that lap_lo @ test_vec should equal lap_array @ test_vec

Technical Details:
- The issue is in _laplace family functions (lines 381-400 in _laplacian.py)
- These functions use broadcasting that adds dimensions for 1D inputs
- The _linearoperator function assigns the same lambda to both matvec and matmat
- LinearOperator's internal reshape fails when matvec returns wrong dimensions

Conclusion:
The bug is 100% reproducible and matches the report exactly. The LinearOperator's matvec method returns a 2D array when given a 1D input, violating the scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator contract.
