## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The scipy.odr documentation never explicitly promises that Model objects should be pickleable. There is no specification or guarantee in the documentation that models created by scipy.odr functions will support serialization. The user is assuming functionality that was never promised.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug is real and reproducible - polynomial models truly cannot be pickled while all other predefined models can. This is an actual inconsistency in the codebase, not a misunderstanding by the user. The error occurs exactly as described.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Pickling scipy models might be considered an edge case that most users don't need. The workaround is simple - users can recreate the polynomial model when needed rather than pickling it. The fix would require refactoring the polynomial function's internal structure, which might not be worth the effort for a rarely used feature.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it creates an inconsistency where 4 out of 5 predefined models work with pickle but one doesn't. Scientific computing workflows often require saving and loading models, making this a practical concern. The fix is straightforward and would improve consistency.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to warn users that polynomial models cannot be pickled, while other predefined models can. This would set proper expectations without requiring code changes. The documentation currently gives no indication of this limitation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This is a code inconsistency issue, not a documentation issue. Documenting a limitation doesn't fix the underlying problem that polynomial behaves differently from all other predefined models. Users would reasonably expect consistent behavior across all predefined models.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding pickle support to polynomial models could be seen as a new feature since it was never explicitly supported. The current implementation works as designed - it just wasn't designed with pickling in mind. This could be framed as requesting enhanced serialization support.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't asking for new functionality but rather consistency with existing functionality. Four predefined models already support pickling - the polynomial model is the outlier. This is about fixing an inconsistency, not adding a new capability.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
There is a clear inconsistency where polynomial models behave differently from all other predefined models without any documentation of this difference. Users reasonably expect consistent behavior across similar APIs. The implementation uses a local function which prevents pickling, while all other models use module-level functions. This appears to be an implementation oversight rather than intentional design.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation never promises pickle support for any scipy.odr models. The code works correctly for its primary purpose (fitting polynomial models). Pickle support could be considered an undocumented feature that happens to work for some models but not others. Without explicit documentation promising this functionality, it's hard to call it a bug.

## Overall consideration
The core issue here is an undocumented inconsistency in the scipy.odr module. The polynomial function is implemented differently from all other predefined models - it uses a local function for the estimate parameter while others use module-level functions. This implementation difference causes polynomial models to fail when pickled, while all other predefined models succeed.

From a user perspective, this is surprising and problematic. The scipy.odr module provides five predefined models that appear to be peers in the API, yet one behaves fundamentally differently in terms of serialization. There's no documentation warning about this difference, and users working with polynomial models will discover this limitation only when their code fails at runtime. Scientific computing workflows commonly involve saving and loading models, making pickle support a reasonable expectation.

However, the scipy documentation never explicitly promises that ODR models should be pickleable. The ability to pickle the other four models could be seen as an implementation detail rather than a guaranteed feature. The primary purpose of these models is to perform orthogonal distance regression, which works correctly. From this perspective, pickle support is a nice-to-have feature that happens to work for some models but isn't part of the core contract. The fix would require refactoring the polynomial function's structure, which might be considered unnecessary complexity for a feature that was never promised.
