DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I reviewed the official documentation for both tf2ss and ss2tf functions:

1. tf2ss DOCUMENTATION:
   - Parameters: "num, den : array_like" - sequences representing polynomial coefficients
   - No explicit statement about required dimensionality (1-D vs 2-D)
   - The term "array_like" in numpy/scipy typically accepts various array formats
   - Examples only show 1-D inputs (lists: [1, 3, 3])
   - No mention of MIMO support or 2-D array handling

2. ss2tf DOCUMENTATION:
   - Clearly states return type: "num : 2-D ndarray"
   - Explicitly documents: "num has one row for each of the system's outputs"
   - For SISO systems (q=1), this means num will have shape (1, n)
   - For MIMO systems (q>1), num will have shape (q, n)
   - The documentation is clear and unambiguous about always returning 2-D

3. ROUND-TRIP CONVERSION:
   - Neither function's documentation explicitly promises round-trip compatibility
   - The documentation doesn't state that ss2tf output can be directly fed back to tf2ss
   - There's no explicit contract that shapes should be preserved

4. SCIPY CONVENTIONS:
   - Looking at other conversion functions:
     * zpk2tf returns 1-D arrays for numerator in SISO case
     * This shows inconsistency within scipy.signal's conversion functions
   - TransferFunction class and other functions accept both 1-D and 2-D inputs
   - Some functions like np.poly1d strictly require 1-D arrays

5. KEY FINDING:
   The ss2tf documentation accurately describes the current behavior - it ALWAYS returns
   a 2-D array for the numerator, with one row per output. This is documented behavior,
   not a bug in implementation vs. documentation.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation correctly describes the actual behavior. ss2tf is documented to return
a 2-D array, and it does. The issue is more about design consistency and user expectations
for round-trip conversions rather than incorrect documentation or implementation not
matching documentation.
