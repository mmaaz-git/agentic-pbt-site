DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. OFFICIAL SCIPY DOCUMENTATION
   The official SciPy documentation for scipy.optimize.cython_optimize clearly defines
   the expected behavior of the zeros_full_output structure.

2. DOCUMENTED STRUCTURE FIELDS
   According to the documentation, zeros_full_output contains:
   - int funcalls: Number of function calls made during root finding
   - int iterations: Number of iterations performed by the solver
   - int error_num: Error status (0=success, -1=sign error, -2=convergence error)
   - double root: The found root value

3. DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOR
   The documentation explicitly states:
   - When error_num = 0, the solver has converged successfully
   - The iterations field should contain "the number of iterations performed by the solver"
   - Example output shown: {'error_num': 0, 'funcalls': 6, 'iterations': 5, 'root': 0.699...}

4. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
   The full_output_example function's docstring states it returns:
   "the root, number of function calls, number of iterations, and the zero function error number"

5. EXPECTED VALUES
   The documentation implies that for successful convergence (error_num=0):
   - iterations should be a non-negative integer
   - iterations should represent actual iteration count
   - There's no documented exception for boundary cases

6. UNDOCUMENTED EDGE CASES
   The documentation does NOT specify:
   - What happens when a root is found at a boundary
   - Whether iterations can be 0 for immediate boundary solutions
   - Any special handling for early termination cases

7. API CONTRACT VIOLATION
   The bug violates the documented API contract:
   - Documentation: "iterations: Number of iterations performed by the solver"
   - Reality: iterations contains uninitialized memory (garbage values)
   - The field should contain a valid count, not random memory contents

8. COMPARISON WITH OTHER SOLVERS
   The documentation shows consistent behavior across all zero-finding methods
   (brentq, bisect, ridder, brenth) - all should populate the same structure
   with valid values when full_output is requested.

9. NO DOCUMENTATION OF LIMITATIONS
   There is no documentation suggesting:
   - The iterations field might be undefined in certain cases
   - Users should check for validity before using iterations
   - Boundary cases are handled differently

CONCLUSION: The documentation clearly establishes that the iterations field should contain
a valid iteration count when error_num=0. The current behavior (uninitialized memory)
directly contradicts the documented API contract. This is not a documentation issue -
the documentation is correct, but the implementation is faulty.
