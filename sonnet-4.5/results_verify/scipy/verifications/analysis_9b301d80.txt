## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. **Valid inputs cause crashes**: The inputs satisfy all documented requirements (strictly increasing times, matching number of rotations)
2. **Silent failure mode**: Construction succeeds but evaluation fails, making it hard to detect problems early
3. **No documented limitations**: The documentation doesn't mention numerical stability requirements or minimum time spacing
4. **Unpredictable behavior**: Users cannot predict which inputs will fail based on documentation
5. **Core functionality broken**: The primary purpose (interpolation) fails for certain valid inputs

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- Could argue numerical stability is an inherent limitation of floating-point math, but this is weak given the lack of documentation

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
1. **Edge case**: Very closely spaced time points (0.0078125 apart) might be considered an obscure edge case
2. **Numerical precision limits**: Could be seen as inherent limitation of floating-point arithmetic

**Why it's NOT WONTFIX:**
- The failure occurs with reasonable inputs (time points 0.0078125 apart is not unreasonably small)
- No warning or documentation exists about this limitation
- The error is not gracefully handled

### Consideration for INVALID

**Why it might be INVALID:**
1. **User error**: Could argue users shouldn't use such closely spaced points

**Why it's NOT INVALID:**
- The inputs meet all documented requirements
- No documentation states minimum spacing requirements
- The library accepts the inputs without immediate error (in some cases)

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. **Missing warnings**: Documentation could be updated to warn about numerical stability with closely-spaced points
2. **Best practices**: Could add guidance on minimum recommended time spacing

**Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code has an actual defect - it fails on valid inputs
- Better error handling in code would be more appropriate than just documenting the limitation
- Silent failures (construction succeeds, evaluation fails) are particularly problematic

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. **Enhanced robustness**: Could frame as requesting better numerical stability
2. **Input validation**: Could request validation to reject problematic inputs early

**Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new features
- The function should work for all valid inputs per its documentation

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Documented requirements are met**: The inputs satisfy all documented constraints (increasing times, correct array shapes, matching counts)

2. **Silent failure is unacceptable**: The most problematic aspect is that construction can succeed while evaluation fails. This violates the principle of failing fast and clearly.

3. **Reasonable inputs fail**: Time spacing of 0.0078125 (about 7.8 milliseconds if times are in seconds) is not an unreasonable precision for many applications (e.g., robotics, animation at 120+ Hz).

4. **No way to prevent**: Users have no documented way to know what time spacing will cause problems, making the library unreliable.

5. **Fix is feasible**: The bug report even proposes reasonable fixes (input validation, numerical safeguards).

The numerical instability could be addressed through:
- Input validation during construction to reject problematic time spacings
- Numerical safeguards to handle near-zero rotation vectors
- Better coefficient computation algorithms
- Clear error messages indicating the problem

This is not just a documentation issue or an obscure edge case, but a genuine bug in the implementation that makes the function unreliable for valid use cases.
