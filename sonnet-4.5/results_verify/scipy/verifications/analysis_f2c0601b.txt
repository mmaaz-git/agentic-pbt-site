BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating this bug report against each possible classification:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The error message literally contains "BUG: ... not supported yet", acknowledging it's a bug
   - The documented mathematical contract (signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder) is violated
   - Leading zeros in polynomials are mathematically valid and should be handled
   - The documentation provides no warning about this limitation
   - The operation works correctly when leading zeros are manually stripped, proving it's possible
   - Common use case: polynomial representations often have leading zeros for higher-order terms

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - None significant - this appears to be a clear bug

2. INVALID (Incorrect Bug Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - None - the bug clearly exists and is reproducible

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The error occurs exactly as described
   - The error message acknowledges it's a "BUG"
   - The mathematical operation is valid and should work

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Users could manually strip leading zeros as a workaround
   - The error message is clear about what's wrong

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - polynomial operations commonly have leading zeros
   - The error message itself says "not supported yet", implying it should be fixed
   - The workaround requires users to understand internal implementation details
   - Breaking the documented contract is not trivial

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue that handling leading zeros is a new feature

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation already promises this should work (via the mathematical contract)
   - The error message says "not supported YET" and "BUG", not "invalid input"
   - This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new capabilities
   - numpy.polydiv attempts to handle this case (though unsuccessfully)

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could update docs to specify that divisor[0] must be non-zero

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The error message explicitly calls this a "BUG", not expected behavior
   - The mathematical operation is valid and should work as documented
   - Documenting a limitation doesn't fix the underlying issue
   - The "not supported yet" phrasing indicates intent to fix, not document

DETAILED ASSESSMENT:

The most compelling evidence is:
1. The error message itself contains "BUG" - the developers acknowledge this is a bug
2. The phrase "not supported yet" indicates this is intended to be fixed, not permanent
3. The mathematical operation is completely valid - [0, 1] is just the polynomial 1
4. The documented contract is violated without any warning in the documentation
5. The proposed fix is simple and maintains backward compatibility

This is NOT an invalid report because the bug is real and reproducible.
This is NOT a documentation issue because the error acknowledges it's a bug to be fixed.
This is NOT a feature request because the functionality is already promised by the docs.
This is NOT worth closing as WONTFIX because it affects legitimate use cases and the developers already acknowledge it needs fixing.

FINAL DETERMINATION: This should be classified as BUG - a valid bug report that should be fixed.
