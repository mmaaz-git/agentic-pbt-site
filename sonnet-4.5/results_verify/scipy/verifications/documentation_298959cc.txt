## Documentation Analysis

### Function Status
- `split_data_line()` is located in the private module `scipy.io.arff._arffread`
- It is NOT part of the public API (`scipy.io.arff.__all__` does not include it)
- The function has no docstring or explicit documentation
- It is an internal utility function used by `loadarff()` for parsing ARFF data lines

### SciPy Documentation Review
The official SciPy documentation for `loadarff`:
- Describes basic ARFF file format requirements
- Lists supported features (numeric, nominal attributes) and unsupported features (date, string, sparse)
- Does NOT specify behavior for empty lines in data sections
- Does NOT document any requirements for line processing or whitespace handling

### ARFF Specification Review
The ARFF specification (Weka documentation):
- States that each instance should be on a single line
- Mentions that commas/tabs may be followed by zero or more spaces
- Comments start with '%'
- Does NOT explicitly address empty lines in the data section
- Does NOT forbid or explicitly allow empty lines

### Key Findings
1. **No documented contract**: There is no documentation specifying what `split_data_line()` should do with empty strings
2. **Internal function**: As a private/internal function (in `_arffread` module), it's not directly exposed to users
3. **Ambiguous specification**: The ARFF format specification doesn't clearly define empty line handling
4. **Implicit expectations**: The function is clearly expected to handle lines from ARFF files, which typically have content

### Documentation Gaps
- The function lacks any documentation about expected input format
- There's no specification about handling edge cases like empty strings
- The ARFF specification itself is ambiguous about empty lines
- The error behavior is not documented

### Conclusion
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state that `split_data_line()` must handle empty strings, the function is part of a robust file parsing pipeline that should gracefully handle various input conditions. The lack of explicit documentation doesn't excuse a crash on reasonable inputs that could occur during normal file processing.
