## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for each category:

#### BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function crashes with an obscure LinAlgError instead of providing clear input validation
- The documentation doesn't warn that step_factor=1.0 is invalid
- The current validation (lines 31-34) explicitly allows step_factor=1.0 by only checking >= 0
- Users have no way to know this value will cause a crash without reading source code
- The crash happens deep in the algorithm, not at input validation where it should be caught
- Even if not exactly 1.0, values very close to 1.0 cause numerical instability (ill-conditioned matrix)
- The algorithm fundamentally cannot work with step_factor=1.0 (no step size reduction means no refinement)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None substantial. This is clearly a bug.

#### INVALID (Report is incorrect)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None. The bug report is technically accurate.

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The reproduction clearly shows the crash occurs as described
- The technical analysis in the bug report is correct
- The root cause (singular Vandermonde matrix) is accurately identified

#### WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- step_factor=1.0 is an unusual edge case that users are unlikely to encounter
- The default value is 2.0, far from the problematic value
- Users who set step_factor=1.0 are misunderstanding the algorithm's purpose

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function should not crash with valid-looking input
- Even if rare, crashes should be prevented with proper validation
- The fix is simple (add input validation)
- Poor error messages harm user experience

#### FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported)
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could argue that supporting step_factor=1.0 is a new feature request

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The function already accepts step_factor=1.0 syntactically (passes validation)
- This is about fixing a crash, not adding new functionality
- The parameter already exists; it just doesn't work correctly for this value

#### DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation issue)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be updated to state that step_factor must not equal 1.0
- Users could be warned about the algorithmic requirements

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code itself is broken - it crashes instead of validating input
- Documentation alone won't prevent the crash
- Proper fix requires code changes to add validation
- This is primarily a code bug, not a documentation issue

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** that should be fixed. The reasons are:

1. **Input validation failure**: The function accepts step_factor=1.0 without complaint but then crashes internally. Proper input validation should catch this at the function entry point.

2. **Algorithmic requirement**: The algorithm fundamentally requires step_factor != 1.0 to work. This is an inherent constraint that should be enforced.

3. **Poor user experience**: Users get a cryptic "Singular matrix" error instead of a clear message about invalid parameter values.

4. **Easy to fix**: Simple validation check would prevent the crash entirely.

5. **Undocumented constraint**: Nothing in the documentation warns users about this limitation.

The bug report's suggested fix (adding validation to reject step_factor close to 1.0) is appropriate and would resolve the issue properly.
