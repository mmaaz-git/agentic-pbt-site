## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
1. The documentation explicitly states that variables starting with digits will not be saved and will issue a warning
2. The implementation does not match the documented behavior - it allows digit-starting variables to be saved
3. MATLAB specifications clearly state that variable names cannot start with digits
4. The behavior is inconsistent - underscore-starting names are filtered correctly, but digit-starting names are not
5. The proposed fix is straightforward and aligns the implementation with the documentation

**Why it might NOT be a BUG:**
- None. This is clearly a bug in the implementation.

### INVALID
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- It is NOT invalid. The documentation clearly specifies the expected behavior, and MATLAB's own specifications confirm that variables starting with digits are not valid.

### WONTFIX
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- It is NOT a trivial issue. This affects compatibility with MATLAB and could lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior when files are loaded in MATLAB.
- The issue is not obscure - it's a fundamental rule of MATLAB variable naming.

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- It could be argued that the documentation is wrong and should be updated to reflect the current behavior
- However, this would be incorrect because:
  1. The documented behavior aligns with MATLAB's own specifications
  2. The current implementation allows creating .mat files that MATLAB cannot properly load
  3. Fixing the documentation would make scipy less compatible with MATLAB, not more

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- It is NOT a feature request. The documentation already promises this functionality; it's just not implemented.
- This is not asking for new functionality, but for the existing documented functionality to work correctly.

### Final Assessment
This is clearly a **BUG**. The implementation fails to match the documented behavior, and the documented behavior is correct according to MATLAB's own specifications. The bug allows the creation of .mat files with variable names that are invalid in MATLAB, which violates the principle of compatibility that scipy.io.matlab aims to provide. The fix is straightforward and necessary for proper MATLAB compatibility.
