## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration as BUG

**Arguments For:**
- The error message is not user-friendly (IndexError instead of a clearer message)
- The model could do parameter validation before accessing B[1]
- Better error handling would improve user experience

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation clearly states it's a 2-parameter model
- All examples show 2 parameters
- The equation y = β₀x + β₁ clearly has 2 parameters
- The code works as documented

### Consideration as INVALID

**Arguments For:**
- The bug report's core premise is flawed: "unilinear" doesn't mean single parameter
- The documentation is clear about requiring 2 parameters
- The model actually means "univariate linear" (one variable, not one parameter)
- User expectation is based on incorrect assumption about terminology
- Code behaves exactly as documented

**Arguments Against:**
- The IndexError is still poor user experience
- The name "unilinear" could be misleading

### Consideration as WONTFIX

**Arguments For:**
- This is an edge case of user misunderstanding
- Adding validation for wrong number of parameters might be overkill
- The error occurs immediately and is traceable

**Arguments Against:**
- Parameter validation is basic and should be included
- This is not an obscure edge case - it's a fundamental usage error

### Consideration as FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments For:**
- Could add better parameter validation
- Could provide clearer error messages
- Could add a separate true single-parameter model

**Arguments Against:**
- This isn't requesting new functionality
- The report claims existing functionality is broken

### Consideration as DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments For:**
- Could clarify that "unilinear" means "univariate linear" not "single parameter"
- Could add a note warning against single parameter usage

**Arguments Against:**
- Documentation already clearly shows 2 parameters
- The equation is unambiguous: y = β₀x + β₁
- Examples all use 2 parameters

### Final Assessment

The bug report is based on a fundamental misunderstanding. The reporter incorrectly assumes "unilinear" means "single parameter linear model" when it actually means "univariate linear model" (one independent variable). The documentation consistently and clearly shows this is a 2-parameter model with equation y = β₀x + β₁.

While the IndexError could be more informative, the core complaint - that the model should work with a single parameter - is invalid because:
1. The documentation never claims it should work with one parameter
2. All documentation clearly shows two parameters
3. The name refers to "univariate" (one variable) not "uni-parameter"

This should be classified as **INVALID** because the code works exactly as documented, and the user's expectation is based on an incorrect interpretation of the model name.
