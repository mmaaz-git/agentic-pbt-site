Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

1. Bug Report Accuracy:
   The bug report is TECHNICALLY ACCURATE. All test cases behave exactly as described.

2. Test Results:

   a) Basic Test Case:
      - Input: np.array([1.0 + 0.0j])
      - Result: ValueError: Invalid number of data points (0) specified
      - Confirmed: Bug reproduced exactly as reported

   b) With explicit n=1:
      - Input: scipy.fft.irfft([1.0+0j], n=1)
      - Result: [1.0]
      - Confirmed: Works correctly when n is specified

   c) Round-trip Test:
      - rfft([1.0]) → [1.0+0j]
      - irfft([1.0+0j]) → ERROR (Invalid number of data points (0))
      - irfft([1.0+0j], n=1) → [1.0]
      - Confirmed: Round-trip fails without explicit n

   d) Hypothesis Test:
      - The property-based test fails immediately on single-element arrays
      - Specific failing case x=[0j] confirmed

3. Root Cause Verification:
   - The default n calculation: n = 2*(m-1) where m=1
   - Results in n = 2*(1-1) = 0
   - Code checks if n < 1 and raises ValueError
   - This is exactly what the bug report describes

4. Mathematical Validation:
   For FFT/IFFT operations on single-element arrays:
   - A single real value has a meaningful FFT (single complex value representing DC component)
   - The inverse should logically return to the single real value
   - The mathematical operation is well-defined
   - numpy.fft.irfft handles this case (returns array of length 2 by default)

5. Impact Assessment:
   - This affects any code that processes variable-length arrays through rfft/irfft
   - Breaks on single-element inputs without explicit n parameter
   - Forces users to add special case handling for m=1
   - Violates the principle of least surprise for FFT operations

The bug is real, reproducible, and the technical details in the report are accurate.
