Documentation Analysis
======================

Official SciPy Documentation (scipy.fft.dct):
----------------------------------------------
The official documentation at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fft.dct.html states:
- "Type I DCT is only supported for input size > 1"
- This is clearly documented as a limitation

Official SciPy Documentation (scipy.fft.dst):
----------------------------------------------
The documentation at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fft.dst.html states:
- "Note that the DST-I is only supported for input size > 1"
- Same limitation documented for DST type 1

Mathematical Definition (Wikipedia):
-------------------------------------
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform:
- "DCT-I is not defined for N less than 2, while all other DCT types are defined for any positive N"
- This confirms DCT-I has a fundamental mathematical limitation
- The DCT-I formula involves cos[Ï€/(N-1) * n * k], which would have division by zero for N=1

Key Documentation Findings:
----------------------------
1. The limitation IS documented in SciPy's official documentation
2. The limitation has mathematical justification (DCT-I undefined for N<2)
3. DST type 1 has the same documented limitation

However, there are important inconsistencies:
----------------------------------------------
1. Error Message: The actual error "zero-length FFT requested" does not match the documented limitation. The documentation says size must be > 1, but the error implies size = 0.

2. DST Behavior: Despite identical documentation, DST type 1 actually WORKS with single-element arrays (returns identity), while DCT type 1 crashes.

3. Error Type: The documentation doesn't specify what error would be raised. A RuntimeError with "zero-length FFT requested" is misleading for a length-1 input.

Conclusion:
-----------
The documentation does mention the limitation, but the implementation's error handling is poor and inconsistent with DST type 1's actual behavior.
