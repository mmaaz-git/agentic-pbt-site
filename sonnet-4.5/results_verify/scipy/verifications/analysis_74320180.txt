## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The documentation explicitly states the return type is "ndarray"
- The actual behavior differs from the documented behavior
- This is not a case of unspecified behavior - the documentation is specific but wrong
- The test correctly identifies this discrepancy

**Conclusion:** This is NOT INVALID because the documentation makes a specific claim that is demonstrably false.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- Could be considered a trivial documentation issue
- The actual behavior (preserving sparsity) is more useful than always returning ndarray
- Users likely already expect and depend on the current behavior

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- Documentation accuracy is important for API contracts
- This affects type checking and static analysis tools
- Not an obscure edge case - it affects the primary use case of the function in scipy.sparse.linalg

**Conclusion:** While it might be tempting to classify as WONTFIX, documentation correctness for return types is important enough to fix.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The user is not asking for new functionality
- The function already works as intended
- This is about documentation accuracy, not missing features

**Conclusion:** This is NOT a FEATURE_REQUEST because no new functionality is being requested.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code behavior is sensible and likely intentional
- Preserving sparsity is a desirable feature for sparse matrix operations
- The examples in the docstring already show the correct behavior (returning sparse arrays)
- Changing the code to match docs would break backward compatibility
- Other functions in the same module (like `inv`) correctly document returning sparse arrays
- The fix is simply updating the docstring to match reality

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- None - this is clearly a documentation issue

**Conclusion:** This is a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The code works correctly and sensibly, but the documentation needs to be updated.

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- There is a mismatch between documented and actual behavior

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The actual behavior is more sensible than the documented behavior
- The code is working as intended
- The issue is with the documentation, not the implementation
- Fixing the "bug" by making the code match the docs would be a regression

**Conclusion:** This is NOT a BUG in the traditional sense because the code is working correctly and as intended.

### Final Assessment
This should be classified as **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. The function's behavior of preserving the sparse structure of the input is intentional, useful, and consistent with good API design for sparse matrix operations. The documentation simply needs to be updated to accurately reflect this behavior, as suggested in the bug report's proposed fix.
