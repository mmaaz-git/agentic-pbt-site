BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug in code behavior)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - Users get incorrect results when following reasonable assumptions
   - Mathematical conventions suggest descending order for polynomial coefficients
   - Silent failures occur with no error messages

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The code itself works correctly when used properly
   - The function does what it was programmed to do
   - The issue is with documentation, not implementation

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - The function technically works as designed
   - There's no explicit promise about coefficient order in documentation

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The bug report is factually correct about the behavior
   - The reproduction steps work exactly as described
   - Users legitimately cannot determine correct usage from documentation

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - These are example/test functions in a cython_optimize submodule
   - Not primary API functions that most users would encounter

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - Can cause serious errors in scientific computing
   - Users may waste significant time debugging incorrect results
   - The fix is simple and would prevent confusion

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation needs correction)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - The code works correctly; only documentation is insufficient
   - The docstring exists but lacks critical details
   - Adding coefficient order specification would resolve the issue
   - No code changes needed, just clearer documentation

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - Could argue this is a code bug for not following conventions
   - Could add validation or warnings in code instead

5. FEATURE_REQUEST (New functionality needed)
   WHY IT MIGHT BE:
   - Could request support for both ascending and descending orders
   - Could request automatic detection of coefficient order
   - Could request better error handling

   WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE:
   - The current functionality exists and works
   - This is about fixing existing behavior, not adding new features
   - The issue is with undocumented behavior, not missing features

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
The core issue is that the documentation fails to specify a critical implementation detail (coefficient order) that differs from mathematical conventions. The code works correctly but users cannot determine proper usage from the documentation. This leads to silent failures where incorrect results are returned without error.

The most appropriate categorization is DOCUMENTATION_FIX because:
1. The code functions correctly when used properly
2. The issue is entirely about missing documentation
3. The fix requires only updating docstrings, not changing code
4. The bug report even provides the exact documentation fix needed
