Documentation Analysis
=====================

## Function Documentation
The scipy.fftpack.next_fast_len function has clear documentation both in the docstring and online documentation that explicitly states:

1. **Parameter Requirements**:
   - "target : int - Length to start searching from. Must be a positive integer."
   - This is stated clearly in line 66 of the source code docstring

2. **Return Value**:
   - "The first 5-smooth number greater than or equal to `target`"
   - 5-smooth numbers are composite of prime factors 2, 3, and 5

3. **Purpose**:
   - Find optimal sizes for FFT operations
   - Used for zero-padding to improve FFT performance

## Implementation Analysis
The function implementation at line 102 simply calls:
```python
return _helper.good_size(target, True)
```

The underlying `_helper.good_size` function:
- Correctly raises ValueError for negative inputs (-1): "Target length must be positive"
- However, it returns 0 for input 0, not raising an error
- This creates an inconsistency with the documented requirement

## Documentation Contract Violation
1. The documentation explicitly requires "Must be a positive integer"
2. By mathematical definition, positive integers are > 0 (they do not include 0)
3. Zero is neither positive nor negative
4. The function should reject 0 as input based on the documented contract

## Comparison with Similar Functions
Looking at rfftfreq in the same file (lines 46-51), it validates n >= 0 (non-negative), showing that SciPy distinguishes between "positive" and "non-negative" requirements.

## Conclusion
The documentation clearly states the requirement for a positive integer, which excludes 0. The current implementation violates this documented contract by accepting 0 and returning 0.
