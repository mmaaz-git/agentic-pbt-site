## Documentation Analysis

### Official pandas Documentation

I examined the official pandas documentation on missing data handling and found the following:

1. **General NA Propagation Rule**:
   - The documentation clearly states: "In general, missing values propagate in operations involving NA. When one of the operands is unknown, the outcome of the operation is also unknown."
   - Examples show: `pd.NA + 1` returns `<NA>`, `"a" * pd.NA` returns `<NA>`

2. **Documented Special Cases**:
   - The documentation explicitly documents that `pd.NA ** 0` returns `1`
   - Also documented: `1 ** pd.NA` returns `1`
   - These are listed as "a few special cases when the result is known, even when one of the operands is NA"

3. **Mathematical Rationale**:
   - The documentation provides the mathematical justification: "Any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1" and "1 raised to any power equals 1"
   - These are considered cases where "the result is known, even when one of the operands is NA"

4. **Multiplication with Zero**:
   - The documentation does NOT explicitly document the behavior of `NA * 0`
   - However, based on the general propagation rule, `NA * 0` returns `<NA>` as observed
   - There is no special case documented for `NA * 0 = 0`

### Key Finding

The behavior where `NA ** 0 = 1` is **explicitly documented and intentional** according to pandas documentation across multiple versions (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.1, 2.3.2). This has been consistent since pandas 1.0 when the NA scalar was introduced.

### Documentation Gaps

While the power operation behavior is documented, the documentation does not:
1. Explain why `NA * 0` doesn't follow the same mathematical identity logic (0 * anything = 0)
2. Address the apparent inconsistency between these two operations
3. Provide guidance on which mathematical identities take precedence over NA propagation

### Conclusion

The behavior is documented as intentional, not a bug in implementation. However, there is a valid concern about consistency that the documentation doesn't address.
