DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

I reviewed the official scipy documentation for scipy.spatial.Delaunay and find_simplex method:

1. FIND_SIMPLEX METHOD DOCUMENTATION:
   - States that points "outside the triangulation" are assigned -1
   - Default tolerance is 100*eps for inside-triangle check
   - Has parameters for bruteforce search and custom tolerance
   - Uses algorithm adapted from Qhull's qh_findbestfacet

2. KEY DOCUMENTATION NOTE ABOUT VERTICES:
   The scipy.spatial.Delaunay documentation contains an important disclaimer:
   "Qhull does not guarantee that each input point appears as a vertex in the Delaunay triangulation"

   This suggests vertices might be omitted from the triangulation in some cases.
   HOWEVER, in our test case:
   - All points ARE vertices (verified by checking tri.simplices)
   - No points are marked as coplanar (tri.coplanar is empty)
   - The issue only occurs in batch mode, not individual queries

3. WHAT "OUTSIDE THE TRIANGULATION" MEANS:
   According to documentation, -1 is returned for points that do not fall within any simplex.
   However, the documentation does NOT clearly state:
   - That vertices themselves could be considered "outside"
   - That batch vs individual queries might behave differently
   - That the default tolerance might be insufficient for vertices

4. TOLERANCE PARAMETER:
   - Documentation mentions tol parameter allows flexibility in determining if point is "inside"
   - Default is 100*eps (where eps is machine epsilon)
   - No warning that default tolerance might fail for vertices

5. NUMERICAL PRECISION WARNINGS:
   - Documentation mentions "depending on how rounding errors go, simplices may be in different order"
   - Mentions potential precision challenges with point inclusion
   - Suggests option "QJ" for precision problems (but this is for triangulation creation, not find_simplex)

DOCUMENTATION GAP: The documentation does not warn users that:
1. Vertices of the triangulation might be reported as "outside" due to numerical precision
2. Batch queries may behave differently from individual queries
3. The default tolerance may be insufficient for reliably finding vertices

The behavior violates the reasonable expectation that vertices of a triangulation should always be "inside" the triangulation when queried.
