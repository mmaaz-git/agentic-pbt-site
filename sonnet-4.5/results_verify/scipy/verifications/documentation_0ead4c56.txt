DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR scipy.ndimage.correlate1d and scipy.ndimage.convolve1d
==================================================================================

1. OFFICIAL SCIPY DOCUMENTATION:

Both correlate1d and convolve1d have nearly identical documentation:
- Same function signature with parameters: input, weights, axis, output, mode, cval, origin
- Both apply 1-D filtering operations along a specified axis
- Both support the same boundary modes: 'reflect' (default), 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap'
- Both have an 'origin' parameter that controls kernel placement

2. MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP IN DOCUMENTATION:

The scipy documentation does NOT explicitly state that correlate(x, w) should equal convolve(x, w[::-1]) for all modes and configurations.

From general scipy documentation searches:
- It is documented that convolution "flips/mirrors the kernel" before applying it
- The documentation mentions that "the origin parameter behaves differently than in the case of a correlation: the results is shifted in the opposite direction"
- No explicit promise is made about the mathematical duality holding for all boundary modes

3. ORIGIN PARAMETER DOCUMENTATION:

The origin parameter documentation is minimal:
- Described only as "origin : int, optional"
- Valid range: -(len(weights) // 2) <= origin <= (len(weights)-1) // 2
- No explicit documentation about how origin affects the relationship between correlation and convolution
- No mention of different behavior for even vs odd-length kernels

4. BOUNDARY MODE DOCUMENTATION:

The 'constant' mode is documented as:
- "Fills beyond edges with a constant value (cval)"
- Default cval is 0.0
- No specific details about how padding is applied for correlation vs convolution

5. COMPARISON WITH NUMPY:

NumPy's correlate/convolve functions are separate from scipy.ndimage versions:
- NumPy versions maintain the mathematical relationship correlate(x, w) = convolve(x, w[::-1])
- NumPy uses different modes ('full', 'same', 'valid') vs scipy.ndimage's boundary modes
- The implementations are fundamentally different

6. KEY FINDING:

The documentation does NOT guarantee that the mathematical relationship correlate(x, w) = convolve(x, w[::-1]) holds for scipy.ndimage functions with all parameter combinations. The documentation only describes them as separate filtering operations with similar interfaces but potentially different internal implementations, especially regarding boundary handling and origin parameter behavior.
