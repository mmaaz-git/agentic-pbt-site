## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

The official scipy documentation for `csgraph_from_dense` states:

**Function signature**:
`scipy.sparse.csgraph.csgraph_from_dense(graph, null_value=0, nan_null=True, infinity_null=True)`

**Parameters documented**:
- `null_value`: Value representing non-edges (default: 0)
- `infinity_null`: If True, treat infinite entries as null edges
- `nan_null`: If True, treat NaN entries as non-edges

### Critical Finding

The documentation explicitly states that:
1. The `null_value` parameter represents values that should be treated as non-edges
2. Only values **equal to** `null_value` should be treated as non-edges
3. Additionally, infinity and NaN can be treated as non-edges based on the boolean flags

**Nowhere in the documentation is there any mention of**:
- An epsilon threshold for comparison
- Automatic dropping of "small" values
- Any threshold below which values are considered equivalent to null_value
- Any special handling for values close to zero

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected (per documentation)**:
- Only values exactly equal to `null_value` should be dropped
- Values like 1e-300, while small, are mathematically distinct from 0 and should be preserved

**Actual behavior**:
- Values smaller than approximately 1e-08 are being dropped
- This is an undocumented threshold that violates the principle of exact equality

### Comparison with Related Functions

The documentation and behavior of `scipy.sparse.csr_array` shows that scipy is capable of and does preserve extremely small values in sparse matrices. The inconsistency between these two functions within the same library further highlights that this is unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly indicates that only exact equality with `null_value` should result in edge removal. The current behavior of dropping small but non-zero values is undocumented and contradicts the stated behavior of the function.
