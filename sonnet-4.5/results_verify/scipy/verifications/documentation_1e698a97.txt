## Documentation Analysis

### Current scipy.spatial.distance.dice Documentation

The function documentation states:
- Computes Dice dissimilarity between two boolean 1-D arrays
- Formula: (c_TF + c_FT) / (2*c_TT + c_FT + c_TF)
- Returns a double representing the Dice dissimilarity
- Notes that to get similarity, use: similarity = 1 - dissimilarity

**Key Finding**: The documentation does NOT specify what happens when both arrays are all-False (empty sets case).

### Mathematical Background (Wikipedia)

The Dice coefficient (Sørensen–Dice coefficient) is:
- A similarity measure (not dissimilarity)
- Formula: DSC = 2|X ∩ Y| / (|X| + |Y|)
- Ranges from 0 to 1
- For identical sets, the value should be 1.0 (perfect similarity)
- The empty sets case (0/0) is not explicitly addressed in standard references

### Comparison with scipy.spatial.distance.jaccard

The jaccard function documentation explicitly states:

"If u and v are both zero, their Jaccard dissimilarity is defined to be zero."

And includes version history:
".. versionchanged:: 1.2.0
   Previously, if all (positively weighted) elements in `u` and `v` are
   zero, the function would return ``nan``.  This was changed to return
   ``0`` instead."

This shows that:
1. Jaccard had the EXACT same bug
2. It was explicitly fixed in version 1.2.0
3. The expected behavior for all-zero vectors is to return 0.0 (distance/dissimilarity of 0)

### Expected Behavior Based on Documentation

While the dice documentation doesn't explicitly state what should happen for all-False arrays:

1. **Mathematical consistency**: Identical arrays should have dissimilarity = 0
2. **Consistency with similar functions**: All other boolean distance functions (jaccard, hamming, rogerstanimoto) return 0.0 for identical all-False arrays
3. **Precedent**: The jaccard function had this exact bug and was fixed to return 0.0
4. **Practical usage**: Users expect distance(x, x) = 0 for any valid x

### Conclusion

The documentation doesn't explicitly define behavior for the all-False case, but:
- Mathematical principles suggest dissimilarity should be 0 for identical arrays
- All similar functions in scipy return 0.0 for this case
- The jaccard function specifically documents fixing this exact issue
- The current NaN return value is inconsistent and problematic for users
