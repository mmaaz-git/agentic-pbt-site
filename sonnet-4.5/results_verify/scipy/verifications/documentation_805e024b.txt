DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Scipy Documentation Review:
   - The scipy.stats.poisson documentation shows an example claiming round-trip property:
     "prob = poisson.cdf(x, mu); np.allclose(x, poisson.ppf(prob, mu))  # Returns True"
   - However, the documentation does NOT specify what ppf should return when q=1.0
   - No explicit mention of how ppf handles edge cases or infinite support distributions

2. Mathematical Definition of PPF for Discrete Distributions:
   From mathematical literature and Wikipedia, the PPF/quantile function is defined as:
   Q(p) = inf{x: F(x) >= p}

   This means ppf(p) should return the minimum value x such that CDF(x) >= p.

3. Behavior of Other Scipy Discrete Distributions:
   Testing revealed two distinct behaviors:

   a) Finite Support Distributions (binomial, hypergeometric):
      - ppf(1.0) returns the maximum possible value (e.g., n for binomial)
      - Round-trip property is preserved

   b) Infinite Support Distributions (Poisson, geometric, negative binomial):
      - ppf(1.0) returns infinity
      - This appears to be a design choice in scipy

4. Key Documentation Gap:
   The scipy documentation does NOT specify:
   - That ppf(1.0) returns infinity for infinite support distributions
   - That the round-trip property ppf(cdf(k)) == k breaks when cdf(k) == 1.0
   - The distinction between finite and infinite support distribution behavior

5. Mathematical Considerations:
   For discrete distributions with infinite support:
   - When CDF(k) numerically equals 1.0 (due to floating-point limits), there IS a finite k
     that achieved this value
   - Mathematically, Q(1.0) = inf{x: F(x) >= 1.0} should return the smallest such k
   - However, scipy appears to special-case q=1.0 to return infinity

6. Consistency Analysis:
   The behavior IS consistent across all scipy infinite-support discrete distributions
   (Poisson, geometric, negative binomial all return inf for ppf(1.0)).
   This suggests it's an intentional design decision rather than a bug specific to Poisson.

Conclusion:
The documentation does not explicitly state that ppf(1.0) should return infinity for
infinite-support distributions, nor does it warn that the round-trip property breaks
in this case. The example in the documentation implies the round-trip works but doesn't
account for this edge case.
