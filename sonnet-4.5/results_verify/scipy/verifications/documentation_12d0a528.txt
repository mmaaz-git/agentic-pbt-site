## Documentation Analysis for scipy.datasets.clear_cache

### Official Documentation Findings:

1. **scipy.datasets.clear_cache documentation**:
   - The function is documented to accept `datasets` parameter that can be:
     - A callable dataset method
     - A list/tuple of callable dataset methods
     - None (to clear all cached files)
   - The documentation explicitly states the parameter should be "callable or list/tuple of callable"
   - No specific documentation about what happens when non-callable values are provided
   - No mention of specific exception types that should be raised for invalid inputs

2. **Python assert statement documentation**:
   - Python documentation clearly indicates assert statements are "debugging assertions"
   - Assert statements are completely disabled when Python runs with -O optimization flag
   - The documentation implies assertions are for debugging, not input validation
   - When -O is used, no code is generated for assert statements at all

3. **PEP 8 guidance**:
   - PEP 8 does not explicitly state "Don't use assertions for data validation" as claimed in the bug report
   - However, the Python documentation's characterization of assertions as "debugging assertions" strongly suggests they shouldn't be used for runtime input validation

### Key Observations:

1. The scipy documentation expects callables as input, making the validation check reasonable
2. Using assert for this validation is problematic because:
   - It can be bypassed with -O flag
   - It's meant for debugging, not runtime validation
   - It leads to inconsistent behavior based on optimization settings

3. The internal function `_clear_cache` is not directly documented, but is used by the public `clear_cache` function

### Conclusion from Documentation:
The documentation establishes that the function expects callable inputs, so validation is appropriate. However, using assert for this validation appears to be a misuse of the assert statement based on Python's documentation characterizing assertions as debugging tools that can be disabled.
