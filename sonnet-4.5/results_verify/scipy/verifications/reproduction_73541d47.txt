Bug Reproduction Results

1. **Property-Based Test Results:**
   - The Hypothesis test DOES find failures as reported
   - Approximately 3% of random rotations with magnitude π fail the round-trip test
   - Failures occur non-deterministically based on numerical precision

2. **Specific Example from Bug Report:**
   - The exact matrix example provided sometimes reproduces, sometimes doesn't
   - This inconsistency is due to floating-point rounding at the π boundary
   - When |rotation| is π + ε (where ε ~ 1e-16), behavior varies

3. **Failure Pattern Analysis:**
   - Out of 200 tests with magnitude π: 6 failures, 194 successes
   - ALL failures show the pattern: rv2 = -rv1 (sign flip)
   - Failures occur when quaternion w component ≈ 0 (within machine epsilon)
   - The rotation matrices remain equivalent (r1.as_matrix() ≈ r2.as_matrix())

4. **Mathematical Verification:**
   - At θ = π: quaternion w = cos(θ/2) = cos(π/2) = 0
   - This creates a sign ambiguity: q = [x,y,z,0] and -q represent same rotation
   - The conversion path: rotvec → quaternion → rotvec can flip signs
   - This is mathematically correct but violates user expectations

5. **Technical Details:**
   - Failures occur when |rv| = π + ε where ε ≈ 4.4e-16
   - The issue is fundamentally about numerical representation at a singularity
   - The rotations are mathematically equivalent (same matrix representation)
   - Only the rotation vector representation differs (by sign)

6. **Reproduction Confirmation:**
   - The bug IS reproducible but not consistently
   - It depends on floating-point precision and rounding
   - The behavior described in the report (sign flip) is confirmed
   - The underlying rotations remain equivalent

Conclusion: The technical details in the bug report are correct. The round-trip property
from_rotvec(as_rotvec(r)).as_rotvec() == r.as_rotvec() does fail for some rotations
with magnitude exactly π, producing negated vectors instead.
