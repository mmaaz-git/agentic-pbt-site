## Documentation Analysis

### scipy.optimize.newton Documentation
The official documentation for newton states:
- rtol is described as "Tolerance (relative) for termination"
- It defaults to 0.0
- No explicit validation requirements or constraints are documented
- The documentation does not specify what values are valid or invalid for rtol
- The documentation does not mention that negative values should be rejected

### scipy.optimize.bisect Documentation
The official documentation for bisect states:
- rtol is used in the condition: np.isclose(x, x0, atol=xtol, rtol=rtol)
- Explicitly states: "cannot be smaller than its default value of 4*np.finfo(float).eps"
- This constraint is clearly documented and enforced in the implementation

### scipy.optimize.brentq Documentation
Similarly to bisect, brentq documentation states:
- rtol "cannot be smaller than its default value of 4*np.finfo(float).eps"
- The constraint is explicitly documented

### Key Findings
1. **Documentation Inconsistency**: While bisect and brentq explicitly document the minimum rtol constraint, newton's documentation does not mention any such constraint.

2. **Mathematical Context**: The mathematical formula for relative tolerance (|a - b| <= atol + rtol * max(|a|, |b|)) inherently requires non-negative rtol values to make mathematical sense. A negative rtol would result in a negative threshold, making convergence criteria nonsensical.

3. **API Consistency**: Even though newton's documentation doesn't explicitly state rtol constraints, the other root-finding methods in the same module establish a clear pattern of validating rtol >= 4*np.finfo(float).eps.

4. **Implicit Expectations**: While not explicitly documented for newton, the mathematical definition of "relative tolerance" implicitly requires non-negative values. Users would reasonably expect consistent validation across similar functions in the same module.

### Conclusion
The documentation for newton does not explicitly state that negative rtol values should be rejected. However, the mathematical context and the documented behavior of similar functions in the same module create a reasonable expectation for consistent parameter validation.
