BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The function crashes with a ValueError on valid sparse matrix input
   - Zero matrices are mathematically valid sparse matrices
   - The documentation does not exclude zero matrices from valid inputs
   - The function returns (0, 0) for identity matrices, so (0, 0) is a valid return value
   - The mathematical definition of bandwidth is well-defined for zero matrices
   - Other libraries (e.g., MATLAB) handle zero/empty matrices gracefully, returning (0, 0)
   - The crash occurs on a basic operation (np.min on empty array) that should be handled
   - The fix is simple and logical: return (0, 0) when there are no non-zero elements

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - None identified

2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
   Arguments FOR:
   - None - the bug is reproducible and the behavior is incorrect

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The report correctly identifies a crash
   - The expected behavior (returning (0, 0)) is mathematically correct
   - The documentation supports the expected behavior

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Zero matrices might be considered an edge case

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - zero matrices are common in sparse matrix operations
   - The crash is not graceful - it's an unhandled exception
   - This affects basic functionality of a public API function
   - The fix is straightforward and doesn't complicate the code

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Functionality)
   Arguments FOR:
   - None - handling all valid sparse matrices is not a new feature

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Zero matrices are valid sparse matrices by definition
   - The function claims to handle sparse matrices without restrictions
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Issue)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The documentation could explicitly state zero matrices are not supported

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation's current wording implies zero matrices should work
   - The mathematical definition supports zero matrices having (0, 0) bandwidth
   - Changing docs to exclude zero matrices would be inconsistent with mathematical definitions
   - Other libraries handle this case correctly

CONCLUSION
----------
This is a clear BUG. The function crashes on valid input (zero sparse matrices) that should
return a well-defined result (0, 0) according to both mathematical definitions and the
function's own documentation. The crash is due to an implementation oversight where empty
arrays are passed to np.min/np.max without checking if they're empty first. The proposed
fix is correct and minimal.
