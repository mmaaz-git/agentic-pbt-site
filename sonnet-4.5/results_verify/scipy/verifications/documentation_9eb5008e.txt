## Documentation Analysis for scipy.spatial.distance.cosine

### Official SciPy Documentation
The official documentation for scipy.spatial.distance.cosine states:
- It computes the Cosine distance between 1-D arrays
- Mathematically defined as: 1 - (dot product of vectors) / (magnitude of u * magnitude of v)
- Takes parameters u, v as input arrays and optional weights w
- Returns a single double value representing the cosine distance

**Key Finding**: The documentation does NOT explicitly specify what should happen when both input vectors are zero vectors.

### Mathematical Definition
Based on mathematical sources and research:
1. Cosine similarity = A·B / (||A|| × ||B||)
2. Cosine distance = 1 - cosine similarity
3. When both vectors are zero: ||A|| = ||B|| = 0, leading to division by zero (0/0)
4. This is mathematically undefined/indeterminate

### Industry Standards and Practices
From various sources (Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues):
- The mathematical consensus is that cosine distance for zero vectors is undefined
- Different libraries handle this differently:
  - Some return NaN (mathematically correct as it represents undefined)
  - Some return 0 (treating identical vectors as having distance 0)
  - Some return 1 (treating as orthogonal)
- Multiple GitHub issues across libraries (scikit-learn, accord-net) discuss this ambiguity
- The general mathematical community considers NaN as the most accurate representation

### Critical Observation
The SciPy documentation does not specify the expected behavior for zero vectors. This is a documentation gap, as this edge case is mathematically significant and commonly encountered. The current behavior (returning NaN) aligns with the mathematical definition of the operation being undefined.
