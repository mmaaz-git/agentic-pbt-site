## Documentation Analysis for scipy.io.hb_write

After reviewing the official SciPy documentation and the Harwell-Boeing format specification, I found the following:

### Official SciPy Documentation
The scipy.io.hb_write documentation states:
- Purpose: "Write a sparse matrix to a Harwell-Boeing format file"
- Parameters: Takes a sparse array or matrix to write
- Supported features: "assembled, non-symmetric, real matrices"
- No explicit mention of handling empty sparse matrices or matrices with zero non-zero elements

### Harwell-Boeing Format Specification
Based on web searches for the official Harwell-Boeing format specification:
1. The format is designed to store sparse matrices efficiently using compressed column storage
2. It stores only the non-zero elements and their positions
3. The format can handle "pattern matrices" which store structural information without values
4. The format uses pointers, indices, and values arrays to represent sparse matrices
5. No explicit prohibition against empty matrices (matrices with zero non-zero elements) was found

### Key Observations
1. The documentation does not explicitly state whether empty sparse matrices (nnz=0) should be supported or not
2. The documentation does not mention any restrictions on minimum number of non-zero elements
3. Empty sparse matrices are mathematically valid - they represent all-zero matrices
4. The Harwell-Boeing format specification itself does not prohibit empty matrices
5. The implementation uses np.max() on arrays that could be empty when nnz=0, which causes the crash

### Conclusion
The documentation does not specify the expected behavior for empty sparse matrices. It neither explicitly supports nor prohibits them. This is a gap in the documentation that leaves the expected behavior undefined.
