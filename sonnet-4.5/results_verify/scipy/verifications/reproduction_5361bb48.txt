## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report. Here are my findings:

#### 1. Core Issue Confirmed
The function `newton_cotes` crashes with a TypeError when given a list with non-uniform spacing and `equal=0`:
- Input: `[0, 0.5, 2]` (list)
- Error: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'list' and 'float'`
- Error location: Line 1056 in `_quadrature.py`: `yi = rn / float(N)`

#### 2. Working vs Non-Working Cases

**Cases that WORK with lists:**
- Uniform spacing: `[0, 1, 2]` with `equal=0` - Success
- Any list with `equal=1` - Success (because line 1040 forces `rn = np.arange(N+1)`)
- Integer input: `newton_cotes(2)` - Success

**Cases that FAIL with lists:**
- Non-uniform spacing: `[0, 0.5, 2]` with `equal=0` - TypeError
- The same input as numpy array works: `np.array([0, 0.5, 2])` - Success

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs because:
1. When `rn` is a list, lines 1038-1042 handle it partially:
   - `len(rn)` works with lists
   - `np.diff(rn)` automatically converts the list to array for the diff operation
   - If spacing is uniform, `equal` is set to 1, and the code path changes

2. When non-uniform spacing is detected (equal=0), the code continues to line 1056
3. Line 1056 attempts `yi = rn / float(N)` where `rn` is still a list
4. Lists don't support division by float, causing the TypeError

#### 4. Comparison with Similar Functions
I tested other scipy.integrate functions:
- `trapezoid([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])` - Works with lists
- `simpson([1, 2, 3], x=[0, 1, 2])` - Works with lists

These functions handle list inputs gracefully, likely by converting them to arrays internally.

#### 5. Hypothesis Test Results
The hypothesis test provided in the bug report fails as expected:
- The test generates lists with various spacings
- Any non-uniform spacing causes the TypeError
- The test correctly identifies the failure case

### Technical Correctness
The bug report is technically accurate:
- The error occurs exactly where reported
- The proposed fix (adding `rn = np.asarray(rn)`) would resolve the issue
- The inconsistency with other scipy.integrate functions is real
