## Triage Analysis for scipy.signal.deconvolve Bug Report

### Considering Each Classification

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The error message explicitly says "BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet"
- The error message includes "not supported yet" implying it SHOULD be supported
- Deconvolution with divisor[0] == 0 is mathematically well-defined
- numpy.polydiv (mentioned in docs as similar) handles leading zeros correctly
- No documentation mentions this limitation
- The function promises a mathematical relationship that should work with divisor[0] == 0
- This is not an obscure edge case - leading zeros in polynomials/signals are common

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None substantial - the error message itself admits it's a bug

#### 2. INVALID (Incorrect Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - the bug clearly exists and is reproducible

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The bug is real and reproducible
- The error message confirms it's a known issue
- The documentation makes no mention of this constraint

#### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Users could potentially work around by removing leading zeros manually
- It's been a known issue (per the error message) but not fixed

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - signals/polynomials with leading zeros are common
- The error message says "not supported yet" implying intention to fix
- The workaround requires users to understand the internal implementation
- Mathematical operations should handle all valid inputs

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (New Feature)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that handling divisor[0] == 0 is a "new feature"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The error message explicitly calls it a "BUG"
- This is basic functionality that the mathematical operation supports
- The function's promise ("signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder") should work for all valid inputs
- numpy.polydiv already handles this case

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation Error)
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could document the limitation instead of fixing the code
- Would be easier than fixing the underlying implementation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The error message explicitly identifies this as a "BUG" not a documentation issue
- The error says "not supported yet" implying it should be fixed in code
- Documenting a limitation that the developers themselves call a bug is not appropriate
- The mathematical operation is well-defined for this case

### Key Evidence

1. **Most Damning Evidence**: The error message literally says "BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet"
   - The developers themselves identified this as a BUG
   - "not supported yet" implies intention to support it

2. **Mathematical Validity**: Deconvolution with divisor[0] == 0 is mathematically valid and well-defined

3. **No Documentation**: The limitation is completely undocumented

4. **Comparable Function Works**: numpy.polydiv handles this case correctly

### Conclusion

This is clearly a **BUG**. The error message itself identifies it as such, using the word "BUG" explicitly and stating the feature is "not supported yet" rather than "not supported" or "invalid input". The developers have already acknowledged this as a bug in their error message. The fact that the mathematically equivalent operation works in numpy.polydiv further confirms this should be supported.
