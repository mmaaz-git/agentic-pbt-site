REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in scipy.sparse.kron.

1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction:
--------------------------------
The property-based test fails consistently. When running the test with m=2, n=2:
- A sparse matrix A with 2 nonzero elements
- An identity matrix I of size 2x2
- Expected nnz in kron(A, I): 2 * 2 = 4
- Actual nnz returned: 8

This shows that kron is storing 4 extra zeros explicitly.

2. Manual Test Reproduction:
-----------------------------
Running the provided manual test code with A = [[0, 1]] and I = eye(2):

Result matrix:
[[0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1.]]

Key observations:
- nnz reports 4 (should be 2)
- Actual nonzeros via np.count_nonzero: 2
- Data array contains: [1. 0. 0. 1.] - explicitly storing two zeros
- After eliminate_zeros(): nnz correctly becomes 2

3. Bug Confirmation:
--------------------
The bug is confirmed. The scipy.sparse.kron function creates a sparse matrix that:
- Stores explicit zero values in its data array
- Reports incorrect nnz count (includes the explicit zeros)
- Can be fixed by calling eliminate_zeros() to remove the explicit zeros

The effect is that sparse matrices created by kron violate the sparse matrix invariant of only storing nonzero elements, leading to:
- Wasted memory
- Misleading nnz attribute
- Potential performance degradation in subsequent operations
