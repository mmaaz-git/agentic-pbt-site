BUG REPRODUCTION REPORT
=======================

1. Hypothesis Test Execution:
The provided Hypothesis test was successfully executed and immediately found the bug. The test failed with:
- Input: u=[0], v=[0] (both arrays are all-False)
- Result: dice returned nan
- Expected: Value between 0.0 and 1.0
- Error: "AssertionError: Distance nan outside valid range for u=[0], v=[0]"

The test correctly identifies that dice returns nan for all-False arrays, which violates the expected range [0.0, 1.0] for a dissimilarity metric.

2. Manual Test Case Execution:
The manual test case confirmed the bug:
- Input: u=[False, False, False], v=[False, False, False]
- Result: dice returned nan with a RuntimeWarning about "invalid value encountered in divide"
- Expected: 0.0 (as these are identical vectors)

Additional testing showed:
- dice([True, False, True], [True, False, True]) = 0.0 (correct for identical vectors with some True values)
- dice([True, True, True], [False, False, False]) = 1.0 (correct for completely different vectors)

3. Root Cause Analysis:
The bug occurs in line 1503 of distance.py:
return float((ntf + nft) / np.array(2.0 * ntt + ntf + nft))

When both arrays are all-False:
- ntt = 0 (no True-True matches)
- ntf = 0 (no True-False matches)
- nft = 0 (no False-True matches)
- Denominator = 2.0 * 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
- Result = 0/0 = nan

4. Impact:
The bug violates the fundamental property of dissimilarity metrics that identical vectors should have dissimilarity 0. This makes the dice metric unreliable for datasets that may contain all-False vectors.

5. Comparison with Other Metrics:
Testing other scipy dissimilarity metrics with all-False identical vectors:
- jaccard: 0.0 (correctly handles this case)
- hamming: 0.0 (correctly handles this case)
- rogerstanimoto: 0.0 (correctly handles this case)
- sokalsneath: Raises explicit error "not defined for vectors that are entirely false"
- dice: nan (the bug)

The dice function is inconsistent with most other metrics which correctly return 0.0 for identical all-False vectors.
