REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report:

1. Created a PPoly with constant zero polynomial:
   - x = [0.0, 1.0] (breakpoints)
   - c = [[0.0]] (constant zero coefficient)

2. Called PPoly.roots() and confirmed the output:
   - Returns: [0.0, nan]
   - Contains NaN: True
   - Assertion fails as expected

3. The bug report's claim is accurate: PPoly.roots() returns an array containing NaN when called on a constant zero polynomial.

4. Additional testing revealed this behavior is consistent:
   - Different intervals (e.g., [5.0, 10.0]) produce [5.0, nan]
   - The pattern is: [start_of_interval, nan]

5. The hypothesis test also confirms the issue - when checking if returned roots are actual zeros by evaluating pp(roots), we get [0.0, nan] values, and the NaN propagates through the evaluation.

The reproduction confirms that the code behaves exactly as the bug report describes.
