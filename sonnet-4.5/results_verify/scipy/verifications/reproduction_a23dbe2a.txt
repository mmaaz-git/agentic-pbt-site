BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug and conducted extensive testing to understand its characteristics.

REPRODUCTION RESULTS:

1. The Bug is Real:
   - The provided test case reproduces exactly as described
   - vq() returns 6.743495761743046e-07 for an exact match
   - py_vq() correctly returns 0.0 for the same exact match
   - Both functions correctly identify the same centroid (index 4)

2. Bug Characteristics:
   - The bug is NOT related to duplicate centroids (contrary to the report's claim)
   - It occurs even with a single centroid in the codebook
   - The bug is highly specific to certain combinations of values

3. Triggering Conditions:
   The bug only occurs with the specific combination:
   - First value: 3.56101766e-04
   - Second value: 3.34689186e+01
   - In a 5-dimensional array with these values in positions 0 and 1
   - The same values individually do not trigger the bug
   - The same values in different positions do not trigger the bug
   - The same values in fewer dimensions do not trigger the bug
   - Scaling the values eliminates the bug

4. Hypothesis Testing:
   - Running 200 hypothesis test examples found multiple failures
   - All failures show vq() returning small non-zero values (typically 6.7e-07 or 1.9e-06)
   - py_vq() consistently returns 0.0 for exact matches
   - The discrepancies are small but systematic

5. Mathematical Verification:
   - Manual Euclidean distance calculation confirms the distance should be exactly 0.0
   - numpy's array_equal() confirms the arrays are identical
   - scipy's cdist() also returns 0.0 for these cases
   - The values are bit-for-bit identical in memory

6. Data Type Analysis:
   - The bug occurs with float64 (default numpy dtype)
   - Converting to float32 eliminates the bug
   - This suggests a precision-related issue in the C implementation

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a genuine numerical precision bug in the C implementation of vq(). When observations exactly match centroids, the function should return precisely 0.0 distance, as the Python reference implementation does. The C version is introducing small numerical errors (around 1e-6 to 1e-7) in specific edge cases.
