## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for scipy.spatial.distance.dice.

### Test Execution Results

1. **Manual Test Case**:
   - Input: Two all-False boolean arrays [False, False, False, False, False]
   - Output: NaN (with RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide)
   - Expected: 0.0
   - Confirmed the bug exists as described

2. **Comparison with jaccard**:
   - jaccard() correctly returns 0.0 for the same all-False inputs
   - jaccard was fixed in scipy 1.2.0 to handle this case (as documented)
   - dice() still has the bug

3. **Root Cause**:
   - The formula (c_TF + c_FT) / (2*c_TT + c_FT + c_TF) produces 0/0 when both vectors are all-False
   - This results in NaN being returned
   - The code does: `return float((ntf + nft) / np.array(2.0 * ntt + ntf + nft))`
   - When all values are False: ntt=0, ntf=0, nft=0, resulting in 0/0 = NaN

4. **Impact**:
   - The bug violates the fundamental metric property that d(x,x) = 0
   - Comparing identical all-False vectors returns NaN instead of 0
   - This is a real issue that can occur when comparing empty feature sets or sparse boolean vectors

The bug is confirmed to exist exactly as reported in the bug submission.
