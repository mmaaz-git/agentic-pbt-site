## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Summary
The bug report is accurate. There is an inconsistency in how scipy.io.wavfile handles mono audio when round-tripping through write and read operations.

### Reproduction Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: CONFIRMED
   - Test fails when n_channels=1
   - Writing shape (N, 1) and reading it back returns shape (N,)
   - Error: AssertionError: Shape mismatch: (1,) != (1, 1)

2. **Simple Example Test**: CONFIRMED
   - Writing [[100]] with shape (1, 1)
   - Reading returns [100] with shape (1,)
   - The shape is not preserved

3. **Multi-Channel Comparison**: CONFIRMED INCONSISTENCY
   - 1 channel: (100, 1) → (100,) ✗ Shape mismatch
   - 2 channels: (100, 2) → (100, 2) ✓ Shapes match
   - 3 channels: (100, 3) → (100, 3) ✓ Shapes match
   - 4 channels: (100, 4) → (100, 4) ✓ Shapes match
   - 1D input: (3,) → (3,) ✓ Shapes match

### Key Findings

1. **Inconsistent behavior**: Only mono audio with 2D shape (N, 1) fails to preserve shape on round-trip. All other cases work correctly.

2. **The issue is in the read function**: Looking at the source code, wavfile.read() only reshapes multi-channel data when channels > 1:
   ```python
   if channels > 1:
       data = data.reshape(-1, channels)
   ```
   For mono (channels == 1), data remains as a 1D array regardless of how it was written.

3. **1D mono input works fine**: Writing a 1D array and reading it back preserves the 1D shape, showing that the issue is specifically with 2D mono arrays.

4. **Documentation ambiguity**: The write() documentation says "To write multiple-channels, use a 2-D array of shape (Nsamples, Nchannels)", which suggests (N, 1) should be valid for mono. However, read() documentation explicitly states it returns "1-D for 1-channel WAV".

### Conclusion
The bug is real and reproducible. There is a shape inconsistency when round-tripping mono audio data that is provided as a 2D array with shape (N, 1).
