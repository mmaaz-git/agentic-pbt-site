## Bug Reproduction Report

### Code Examination
I examined both files mentioned in the bug report:
- `/scipy/datasets/_fetchers.py` line 34: Uses `f"SciPy {sys.modules['scipy'].__version__}"`
- `/scipy/datasets/_download_all.py` line 54: Uses `"SciPy"`

Both functions reference the same GitHub issue #21879 with identical comments, suggesting they should handle this the same way.

### Test Execution
I ran the provided property-based test which confirms the inconsistency:
- `fetch_data` sends User-Agent: "SciPy 1.16.2"
- `download_all` sends User-Agent: "SciPy"

The test fails with: `AssertionError: User-Agent headers differ: fetch_data='SciPy 1.16.2' vs download_all='SciPy'`

### Effect Analysis
The bug is real and has the following effects:

1. **Inconsistent server-side behavior**: The two functions that download SciPy datasets send different User-Agent headers, which could result in different treatment by servers (rate limiting, access permissions, logging).

2. **Both functions do the same thing**: Both `fetch_data()` (internal, used by ascent(), face(), electrocardiogram()) and `download_all()` (public API) download datasets from the same registry using pooch, so they should behave consistently.

3. **Same issue reference**: Both functions cite GitHub issue #21879 about adding User-Agent headers to avoid 403 errors from GitHub, suggesting they were both modified for the same reason and should use the same approach.

The bug report accurately describes an inconsistency in the codebase where two functions performing similar operations use different User-Agent headers despite referencing the same issue that motivated adding them.
