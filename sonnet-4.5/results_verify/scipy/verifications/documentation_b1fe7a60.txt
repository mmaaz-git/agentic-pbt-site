DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
The `split_data_line` function has no docstring and is not part of the public API. It's an internal utility function within the _arffread module. The public API only exposes:
- loadarff()
- MetaData
- ArffError
- ParseArffError

2. ARFF SPECIFICATION RESEARCH
According to the official ARFF format specification from Weka:
- Data lines contain comma-delimited attribute values
- Each instance is on a single line
- Missing values are represented by '?'
- Comments start with '%'
- The specification does NOT explicitly address empty lines in the data section

3. INTERNAL FUNCTION USAGE
The function is used in three contexts within the module:
a) Line 130: Parsing nominal attribute values from regex match groups
b) Line 374: Parsing relational attribute data after splitting by newlines
c) Line 865: General data line parsing

4. CRITICAL OBSERVATION - RELATIONAL ATTRIBUTES
In the RelationalAttribute.parse_data() method (line 373-374), the code explicitly splits data by newlines:
```python
for raw in escaped_string.split("\n"):
    row, self.dialect = split_data_line(raw, self.dialect)
```

This split operation CAN produce empty strings when:
- There are trailing newlines in the data
- There are multiple consecutive newlines
- The data string ends with a newline

5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
Given that:
- The function is internal (not public API)
- It's called after splitting by newlines (which can produce empty strings)
- The ARFF spec doesn't explicitly forbid empty lines
- Empty ARFF data sections are allowed per documentation

The function should handle empty strings gracefully rather than crashing.

6. DOCUMENTATION VERDICT
There is NO documentation stating that split_data_line should reject empty strings or that empty lines are invalid. The crash is an implementation oversight, not a violation of documented behavior. The function is expected to parse CSV-like data lines, and should handle edge cases like empty strings without crashing, especially since it's called in contexts where empty strings are possible.
