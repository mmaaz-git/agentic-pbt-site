Bug Reproduction Analysis

I successfully reproduced the reported bug with the following findings:

1. Normal Python Execution (without -O flag):
   - When passing non-callable values (e.g., "not_a_callable", 42, etc.) to _clear_cache()
   - Result: AssertionError is raised as expected (when cache directory exists)
   - This matches the bug report's claim

2. Python Execution with -O flag:
   - When running `python3 -O` with the same non-callable inputs
   - Result: AttributeError is raised with message like "'str' object has no attribute '__name__'"
   - This exactly matches the bug report's claim
   - The assert statement on line 36 is disabled, causing execution to continue to line 37
   - Line 37 tries to access dataset.__name__ which fails for non-callable objects

3. Hypothesis Test:
   - The provided hypothesis test passes successfully
   - It correctly identifies that either AssertionError or AttributeError is raised depending on optimization flags

4. Behavior Consistency:
   - The behavior is indeed inconsistent between normal and optimized execution
   - Without -O: AssertionError (clear validation error)
   - With -O: AttributeError (confusing error about missing __name__ attribute)

5. Edge Case Discovery:
   - When the cache directory doesn't exist, the function returns early (line 25-26)
   - This means the assert is never reached if the directory is missing
   - This creates additional inconsistency in error handling

The technical details in the bug report are accurate. The assertion on line 36 is indeed used for input validation, and when Python optimization is enabled, this validation is bypassed, leading to a less helpful error message.
