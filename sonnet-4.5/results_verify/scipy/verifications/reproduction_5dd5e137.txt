REPRODUCTION RESULTS

I successfully reproduced the behavior described in the bug report. Here are the findings:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION TEST:
   - Input: 2-D array with shape (3, 1) containing [[100], [200], [300]]
   - Output after round-trip: 1-D array with shape (3,) containing [100, 200, 300]
   - Shape preserved: FALSE
   - Data values preserved: TRUE

2. SINGLE-CHANNEL VS MULTI-CHANNEL COMPARISON:
   - 1-channel input (10, 1) → output (10,) - shape NOT preserved
   - 2-channel input (10, 2) → output (10, 2) - shape preserved
   - This confirms the asymmetry only affects single-channel audio

3. 1-D INPUT TEST:
   - 1-D input (3,) → output (3,) - shape preserved
   - This shows that 1-D arrays DO round-trip correctly

4. HYPOTHESIS PROPERTY TEST:
   - The test fails consistently for n_channels=1
   - All tests with n_channels > 1 pass successfully
   - Failure rate: 100% for single-channel 2-D arrays
   - Pass rate: 100% for multi-channel arrays

5. TECHNICAL DETAILS CONFIRMED:
   - The bug report's code examples are accurate
   - The described behavior is reproducible
   - The assertion failures occur exactly as described
   - Data values are preserved correctly (only shape is affected)

IMPORTANT OBSERVATION:
The behavior is 100% consistent and predictable:
- Single-channel audio ALWAYS returns as 1-D
- Multi-channel audio ALWAYS returns as 2-D with original shape
- This is not random or intermittent behavior

The technical accuracy of the bug report is confirmed. However, whether this constitutes a BUG depends on whether this behavior is intended (as suggested by the documentation) or whether round-trip shape preservation should be considered a fundamental property of these functions.
