## Documentation Analysis for scipy.signal.windows.kaiser

### Official Documentation Review

The function documentation (both in docstring and online) states:

1. **Return Value**: "The window, with the maximum value normalized to 1"
   - No mention that NaN values might be returned instead of a window

2. **Parameters**:
   - M: Number of points (integer)
   - beta: Shape parameter (float)
   - No documented limits or constraints on beta values

3. **Critical Note (line 1242-1245)**:
   "A beta value of 14 is probably a good starting point. Note that as beta gets large, the window narrows, and so the number of samples needs to be large enough to sample the increasingly narrow spike, otherwise NaNs will be returned."

### Documentation Issues

1. **Vague Warning**: The documentation mentions NaN values can occur but:
   - Does not specify what constitutes "large" beta values
   - Does not specify what "large enough" M values are needed
   - Does not provide any formula or guideline for safe parameter ranges
   - The warning is buried in the Notes section, not prominently displayed

2. **No Parameter Validation**: The documentation doesn't indicate:
   - Maximum safe beta values
   - Minimum M values for given beta
   - Any relationship between M and beta to avoid NaNs

3. **Inconsistency with Return Value Documentation**:
   - The Returns section states the window has "maximum value normalized to 1"
   - It doesn't mention the possibility of NaN values being returned
   - This creates an expectation that the function always returns a valid window

### Mathematical Background

The Kaiser window uses the modified Bessel function I₀ which grows exponentially. For beta ≈ 710 and above, I₀(beta) exceeds float64 limits, causing overflow to infinity and subsequent NaN in division.

### Comparison with Best Practices

Well-documented numerical functions typically:
1. Specify numerical limits clearly
2. Raise exceptions for out-of-range inputs
3. Document edge cases in parameter descriptions, not just notes
4. Provide validation or safe parameter guidelines

### Conclusion

While the documentation does mention potential NaN values, it fails to:
- Provide actionable guidance on avoiding them
- Specify concrete parameter limits
- Make the warning prominent enough
- Reconcile the NaN possibility with the stated return value description

The documentation is technically present but inadequately specific and buried in a way that makes the function error-prone for users.
