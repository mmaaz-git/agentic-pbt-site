Bug Report Triage Analysis
==========================

Considering each potential categorization:

1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed):
   PROS:
   - Documentation explicitly states variables starting with digits should be ignored
   - Documentation explicitly states MatWriteWarning should be issued
   - The implementation violates both of these documented behaviors
   - MATLAB itself doesn't allow variable names starting with digits
   - The code already correctly validates struct fields but not top-level variables
   - The property-based test confirms the violation
   - The fix is straightforward and localized

   CONS:
   - None identified

2. INVALID (Report is incorrect):
   PROS:
   - None - the bug report is accurate

   CONS:
   - The documentation clearly states the behavior
   - The implementation demonstrably violates it
   - Tests confirm the bug exists

3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
   PROS:
   - Could argue that files with digit-starting variables might still work in some contexts

   CONS:
   - This violates MATLAB's fundamental variable naming rules
   - The documentation promises specific behavior that isn't delivered
   - Users relying on the documented behavior will have incorrect files created
   - This is a clear contract violation, not a trivial edge case

4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported):
   PROS:
   - None - the documentation already says this should work

   CONS:
   - The documentation explicitly describes this as current behavior
   - This is not asking for new functionality

5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
   PROS:
   - Could change documentation to match implementation

   CONS:
   - The documented behavior is the CORRECT behavior
   - MATLAB doesn't allow such variable names
   - The struct field validation already implements the correct check
   - It would be wrong to document incorrect behavior rather than fix it

CONCLUSION:
This is clearly a BUG. The implementation violates its documented contract in two ways:
1. It saves variables that start with digits (should ignore them)
2. It doesn't issue MatWriteWarning (should issue warning)

The documentation correctly describes what the behavior should be, consistent with MATLAB's rules.
The implementation is incorrect and should be fixed as proposed in the bug report.
