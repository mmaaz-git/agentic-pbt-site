## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG classification:

**Arguments FOR:**
1. **Documentation violation**: The docstring explicitly states "By default, return all keys" but find(None) only returns 355 of 445 keys
2. **Inconsistent API**: The function is named after and documented to search "physical_constant keys" but only searches a subset
3. **User expectation mismatch**: Users can access ALL constants via physical_constants dictionary but cannot discover them via find()
4. **Practical impact**: Users searching for constants like 'muon' miss 6 valid results (22 found vs 28 actual)
5. **Clear fix available**: Simple change from _current_constants to physical_constants in the implementation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The current behavior might be intentional to guide users toward current CODATA values
2. Returning obsolete constants in searches might confuse users who don't expect deprecated values

### Considering INVALID classification:

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The implementation might be working as designed, only showing current constants
2. Users who need obsolete constants can still access them directly

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation clearly says "return all keys" without qualification
2. The docstring refers to "physical_constant keys" which is the name of the full dictionary
3. The inconsistency between access methods is confusing

### Considering WONTFIX classification:

**Arguments FOR:**
1. This might be considered a minor edge case affecting only users of obsolete constants
2. The current behavior encourages use of up-to-date CODATA values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This affects 90 out of 445 constants (20% of the dataset)
2. Scientific reproducibility requires access to historical constant values
3. The fix is trivial and doesn't break existing functionality

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX classification:

**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could argue the documentation should clarify it only searches current constants
2. The documentation could be updated to match the current behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function name and documentation strongly imply searching all physical_constants
2. Changing documentation would make the API less intuitive and useful
3. The code fix is simpler and more correct than changing documentation

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST classification:

**Arguments FOR:**
1. Could be viewed as a request to add searching of obsolete constants

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is not a new feature - the documentation already promises this behavior
2. The physical_constants dictionary already contains all constants
3. This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new capability

### Conclusion:

This is clearly a **BUG**. The documentation unambiguously states the function should "return all keys" by default and search "physical_constant keys" (referring to the physical_constants dictionary). The implementation contradicts this by only searching _current_constants. The impact is significant (20% of constants are unsearchable) and the fix is straightforward.
