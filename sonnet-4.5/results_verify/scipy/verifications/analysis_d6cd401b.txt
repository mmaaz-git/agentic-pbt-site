## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation for `clear_cache()` never explicitly states that invalid dataset methods must raise a ValueError. The docstring only describes what happens with valid inputs (clearing cache for specified datasets) but doesn't document the error handling behavior. Since the documentation doesn't promise validation will always occur, the current behavior of silently returning when cache doesn't exist could be considered acceptable undefined behavior. The function successfully achieves its primary goal - there's nothing to clear when the directory doesn't exist, regardless of input validity.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The source code clearly shows intentional validation logic that raises a descriptive ValueError when invalid dataset methods are provided. This validation exists in the code and works when the cache directory exists, suggesting it's an intended feature. The inconsistent behavior based on filesystem state is problematic and violates the principle of least surprise.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an edge case that only occurs when the cache directory doesn't exist, which is typically only on first use or after manual deletion. The practical impact is minimal - if someone passes an invalid dataset method when there's no cache, nothing bad happens (no files are deleted incorrectly). The fix would add complexity for a scenario that rarely matters in practice. Most users will use valid dataset methods from the scipy.datasets module.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Input validation is a basic programming principle that shouldn't depend on filesystem state. The inconsistent behavior makes debugging harder - the same code might work in development (no cache) but fail in production (with cache). The fix is straightforward and improves API consistency without significant performance impact.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify what should happen with invalid inputs or when the cache directory doesn't exist. The current behavior could be considered correct if documented properly. We could update the documentation to state: "When the cache directory doesn't exist, the function returns immediately without validation. Invalid dataset methods are only detected when the cache directory exists." This would make the current behavior officially correct.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The validation code exists and appears intentional - it's not just missing documentation, but rather a bug where validation is bypassed. Documenting inconsistent behavior doesn't make it good design. Users would reasonably expect input validation to occur regardless of filesystem state.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current code doesn't validate inputs when cache doesn't exist, and adding this validation could be seen as a new feature rather than fixing a bug. The request is essentially asking for enhanced input validation that works consistently. This could be framed as "Add consistent input validation to clear_cache regardless of cache directory state."

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The validation code already exists and works in most cases - this isn't adding new functionality but fixing existing validation to work consistently. The error message and validation logic are already implemented, just bypassed in one scenario.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function exhibits inconsistent behavior where the same invalid input sometimes raises ValueError and sometimes doesn't, based solely on filesystem state. This violates the fail-fast principle and makes the API unpredictable. The validation code clearly exists and is intended to catch invalid inputs, but the early return bypasses it. This is a logic error where two independent concerns (cache directory existence and input validation) are incorrectly coupled.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation never promises that invalid inputs will raise errors. The function's primary purpose is to clear cache, and when there's no cache to clear, returning early is reasonable. The behavior could be considered a pragmatic optimization - why validate inputs when there's nothing to do anyway? The function successfully completes its documented purpose in all cases.

**Overall consideration**
After careful analysis, this appears to be an INVALID bug report. The key issue is that the documentation never specifies that invalid dataset methods must raise a ValueError. While the code does include validation logic that raises ValueError for invalid datasets, this is an implementation detail not promised by the API contract. The documentation only describes the happy path - what happens with valid inputs - and is silent on error handling.

The early return when cache doesn't exist is a reasonable optimization. When there's no cache directory, there's literally nothing to clear, so extensively validating inputs that won't be used anyway could be considered unnecessary. The function achieves its documented purpose (clearing cache) correctly in all cases - when the directory doesn't exist, there's nothing to clear, and the function correctly does nothing.

While the inconsistent behavior might be surprising to developers, surprising behavior is only a bug if it contradicts documented behavior. Since the documentation makes no promises about input validation or error handling, the current implementation is technically correct. This could at best be considered a DOCUMENTATION_FIX to clarify the behavior, but given the minimal practical impact and the fact that most users will use valid dataset methods from the scipy.datasets module, even that seems unnecessary.
