## Documentation Analysis for scipy.integrate.newton_cotes

Based on my review of the official documentation and source code, here are the key findings:

### Parameter Documentation

The documentation for the `rn` parameter states:
- "rn : int - The integer order for equally-spaced data or the relative positions of the samples with the first sample at 0 and the last at N, where N+1 is the length of `rn`. N is the order of the Newton-Cotes integration."

This indicates that `rn` can be either:
1. An integer (for equally-spaced data)
2. A sequence of relative positions (for non-equally-spaced data)

### Key Observations

1. **No explicit type requirement**: The documentation does not explicitly state that when `rn` is a sequence, it must be a numpy array. It simply says "relative positions of the samples".

2. **Examples use numpy arrays**: The documentation examples show `np.linspace()` being used, which returns a numpy array. However, this is shown only for the integer case with equally-spaced data (when `rn` is an integer N, not a sequence).

3. **Implicit array operations**: The documentation shows mathematical formulas but doesn't clarify implementation details about whether lists are automatically converted to arrays.

4. **Comparison with other functions**: Other functions in scipy.integrate (like `trapezoid` and `simpson`) do accept both lists and numpy arrays for their inputs. The documentation for these functions also doesn't explicitly require numpy arrays.

5. **Source code behavior**: Looking at the source code (lines 1037-1046), the function attempts to:
   - Get the length of `rn` (line 1038) - this works with lists
   - Check if differences are uniform (line 1041) using `np.diff(rn)` - this converts lists to arrays
   - However, at line 1056, it performs `yi = rn / float(N)` which fails with lists

### Documentation Gaps

The documentation does not:
- Explicitly state that `rn` must be a numpy array when providing sample positions
- Mention any difference in behavior between lists and arrays
- Warn about potential TypeErrors when using lists with non-uniform spacing

### Consistency Issue

The documentation and behavior are inconsistent because:
- The function partially works with lists (uniform spacing case)
- The function fails with lists for non-uniform spacing
- Other similar functions in the same module accept lists without issues
