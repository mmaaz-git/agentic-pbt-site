REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed.

Test Results:
-------------
1. Hypothesis Test: The specific test case with base_name='test' and appendmat=True FAILED as expected.
   - Expected behavior: File should be saved as 'test.mat'
   - Actual behavior: File was saved as 'test' (without .mat extension)

2. Manual Reproduction: Confirmed the bug with the following findings:
   - When savemat(fname='test', data, appendmat=True) is called:
     * File is saved as 'test' NOT 'test.mat'
     * os.path.exists('test.mat') returns False
     * os.path.exists('test') returns True

   - When savemat(fname='test2', data, appendmat=False) is called:
     * File is saved as 'test2' (as expected)
     * No .mat extension is added (as expected)

3. Additional Finding - loadmat behavior:
   - loadmat(fname='test', appendmat=True) successfully loads the file
   - This shows that loadmat DOES handle appendmat correctly by trying both with and without .mat extension
   - This creates an asymmetry between savemat and loadmat behavior

Effect of the Bug:
-----------------
1. Files saved with savemat(appendmat=True) do not have the .mat extension appended
2. This violates the documented behavior that states the extension should be appended
3. This breaks symmetry with loadmat which properly handles the appendmat parameter
4. Users expecting files to be saved with .mat extension will not find them at the expected path
5. This could break workflows that rely on consistent .mat file naming conventions

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
