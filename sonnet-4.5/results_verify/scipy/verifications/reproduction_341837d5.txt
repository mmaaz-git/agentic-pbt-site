REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

## Property-Based Test Results

The property-based test provided in the bug report was executed with the two specific failing inputs:

1. n_keyframes=5, seed=493:
   - Failed at the last keyframe (time=9.53565684, index=4)
   - Expected quaternion: [-0.29974423 -0.77272482 -0.38528129 -0.40571921]
   - Actual quaternion: [0.36323199  0.14588579  0.83703975 -0.38228826]
   - The spline did NOT return the exact keyframe rotation at the last time point

2. n_keyframes=4, seed=4:
   - Failed at the last keyframe (time=9.72684360, index=3)
   - Expected quaternion: [-0.56293728  0.17080447 -0.29532735  0.75280091]
   - Actual quaternion: [-0.78795075  0.13824147 -0.45366089 -0.39270181]
   - The spline did NOT return the exact keyframe rotation at the last time point

## Specific Example Results

The specific example provided in the bug report was also tested:
- 5 keyframes with times: [0.0, 6.64446271, 9.24290286, 9.3721529, 9.53565684]
- The spline correctly returns exact keyframe rotations for indices 0, 1, 2, and 3
- At the last keyframe (index 4, time=9.53565684):
  - Expected: quaternion of 5th keyframe [-0.29974423 -0.77272482 -0.38528129 -0.40571921]
  - Actual: quaternion of 4th keyframe [0.04451323 -0.38889422 -0.59025565 -0.70595901]

## Pattern Observed

The bug consistently occurs at the LAST keyframe when:
1. Multiple keyframes are provided (n >= 4)
2. The last few keyframes are closely spaced in time (as noted in the report)
3. The spline appears to return the second-to-last keyframe's value instead of the last

The bug is reproducible and the outputs match exactly what the bug report claims.
