Bug Reproduction Analysis for scipy.constants.find
===================================================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in scipy.constants.find. Here are my findings:

1. BUG CONFIRMED: The find() function cannot locate 90 constants that exist in physical_constants

2. Test Results:
   - The constant 'Planck constant over 2 pi' exists in physical_constants dictionary
   - Value: (1.0545718e-34, 'J s', 1.3e-42)
   - But find('Planck constant over 2 pi') returns an empty list []

3. Scope of the Issue:
   - physical_constants contains 445 keys total
   - _current_constants (CODATA 2022) contains only 355 keys
   - 90 constants (20% of total) are inaccessible via find()

4. Root Cause:
   - physical_constants is built from multiple CODATA versions (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022)
   - All versions are merged into physical_constants via .update() calls
   - But find() only searches _current_constants, which points to _physical_constants_2022

5. Examples of Affected Constants:
   - 'Planck constant over 2 pi' (from older CODATA versions)
   - 'Planck constant in eV s'
   - 'Boltzmann constant in inverse meters per kelvin'
   - 'Compton wavelength over 2 pi'
   - 'Cu x unit'
   - 'Mo x unit'
   - And 84 other constants from older CODATA versions

6. Impact:
   - Users can access these 90 constants via physical_constants['key']
   - But they cannot discover them using find()
   - find(None) returns 355 keys instead of all 445 keys
   - This makes 20% of available constants undiscoverable through the search function

The bug is real and affects the discoverability of legitimate constants that are part of the public API.
