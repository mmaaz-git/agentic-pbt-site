Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug using both the Hypothesis test and the manual reproduction code.

## Hypothesis Test Results
The Hypothesis test failed as expected with target=0, confirming that scipy.fftpack.next_fast_len(0) returns 0 instead of raising a ValueError. The test correctly detects this as a failing case.

## Manual Test Results
1. `scipy.fftpack.next_fast_len(0)` returns 0 (does not raise an exception)
2. `scipy.fftpack.next_fast_len(-1)` correctly raises `ValueError: Target length must be positive`
3. Using the result (0) in `scipy.fftpack.fft` causes a `ValueError: invalid number of data points (0) specified`

## Key Observations
- There is an inconsistency: negative values (-1) correctly raise ValueError, but 0 is silently accepted and returns 0
- The returned value of 0 is not usable in FFT operations, causing downstream errors
- The function behavior is inconsistent between 0 and negative values

The bug report accurately describes the issue: the function accepts 0 when it should reject it according to its contract.
