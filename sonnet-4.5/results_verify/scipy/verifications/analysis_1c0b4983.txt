## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states that with 'wrap' mode "the last point and initial point exactly overlap" and "it is not well defined which sample will be chosen at the point of overlap." This ambiguity is documented behavior, not a bug. The documentation never promises invertibility for 'wrap' mode, and the observed behavior matches the documented ambiguity. The user's expectation of invertibility is based on their assumption about what periodic boundaries should mean, not on any documented promise.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The user's expectation that periodic boundary conditions should be invertible is reasonable and matches the mathematical definition of periodic boundaries. Even with order=0 (nearest neighbor), where no interpolation occurs, basic array rotation should be reversible. The fact that 'grid-wrap' works correctly suggests that invertibility is a reasonable expectation for periodic boundaries.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The 'wrap' mode behavior has been known since at least 2017 (issue #2640) and SciPy chose to introduce 'grid-wrap' as a new mode rather than fix 'wrap'. This suggests the maintainers consider 'wrap' mode's behavior as legacy that they don't want to change for backward compatibility. The issue affects only users who expect mathematical correctness from 'wrap' mode, while 'grid-wrap' provides the correct alternative.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The broken behavior of 'wrap' mode is clearly incorrect from a mathematical perspective and could silently corrupt data in scientific applications. Users reasonably expect periodic boundaries to work correctly, especially with order=0. The existence of 'grid-wrap' doesn't excuse having a broken 'wrap' mode that gives incorrect results.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation mentions ambiguity at overlapping points but doesn't explicitly warn users that 'wrap' mode is not invertible and will produce incorrect results for round-trip operations. The documentation should more strongly recommend 'grid-wrap' over 'wrap' and explicitly state that 'wrap' has known issues with invertibility. Adding a clear warning would prevent user confusion.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation already states there's ambiguity in 'wrap' mode and the introduction of 'grid-wrap' implicitly acknowledges the issues with 'wrap'. The documentation doesn't promise invertibility, so technically it's not wrong. The code behaves exactly as documented - with ambiguity at boundaries.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for 'wrap' mode to behave like 'grid-wrap' mode, which would be changing the behavior to add a new capability (invertibility). Since 'wrap' mode never promised invertibility, making it invertible would be adding a new feature. This could be seen as a request to deprecate 'wrap' in favor of 'grid-wrap' or to make 'wrap' an alias for 'grid-wrap'.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user isn't asking for new functionality but expecting basic mathematical correctness from existing functionality. Periodic boundary conditions inherently should be invertible - this is not a new feature but a fundamental property. The fact that it doesn't work is a bug, not a missing feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The behavior is mathematically incorrect and violates the fundamental property of periodic boundaries. With order=0 (nearest neighbor interpolation), there's no interpolation happening, so a simple circular shift should be perfectly reversible. The fact that it loses data (replacing 4 with 0) is clearly wrong. Even if the documentation mentions ambiguity, producing incorrect numerical results in scientific computing software is a bug.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation explicitly states the ambiguity in 'wrap' mode and never promises invertibility. The behavior matches what the documentation says - there's ambiguity at the boundary. SciPy already addressed this by introducing 'grid-wrap' mode, implying they consider 'wrap' mode's behavior as designed (even if poorly). The existence of a working alternative ('grid-wrap') suggests this is documented, expected behavior, not a bug.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX** issue rather than a BUG. While the behavior is mathematically incorrect and frustrating for users, several factors point to this classification:

First, the documentation explicitly mentions the ambiguity in 'wrap' mode at boundary points, though it could be much clearer about the practical implications. The statement "it is not well defined which sample will be chosen at the point of overlap" technically covers the observed behavior, even though users might not realize this means the function won't be invertible. The documentation never promises that shift operations will be reversible.

Second, SciPy's response to this known issue (dating back to at least 2017) was to introduce 'grid-wrap' mode in version 1.6 rather than fix 'wrap' mode. This deliberate choice suggests the maintainers view 'wrap' mode's behavior as legacy functionality they won't change for backward compatibility reasons. They provided a solution ('grid-wrap') rather than fixing the original problem, indicating they consider the current 'wrap' behavior as intended, even if flawed.

Third, while the user's expectation of invertibility for periodic boundaries is entirely reasonable from a mathematical standpoint, the specific implementation of 'wrap' mode with its documented ambiguity means the observed behavior technically matches the documentation. The real issue is that the documentation doesn't adequately warn users that 'wrap' mode is unsuitable for applications requiring true periodic boundaries and that 'grid-wrap' should be used instead. The documentation should explicitly state that 'wrap' mode is not invertible and will produce incorrect results in round-trip operations, directing users to 'grid-wrap' for mathematically correct periodic boundary conditions.
