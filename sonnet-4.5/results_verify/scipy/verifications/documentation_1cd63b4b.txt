DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. SciPy Official Documentation:
The scipy.spatial.distance.dice documentation states:
- Purpose: "Compute the Dice dissimilarity between two boolean 1-D arrays"
- Formula: (c_TF + c_FT) / (2*c_TT + c_FT + c_TF)
- Returns: "The Dice dissimilarity between 1-D arrays u and v"
- Range: Implicitly 0 to 1 for dissimilarity (as similarity = 1 - dissimilarity)

The documentation DOES NOT:
- Specify what happens when both vectors are all-False
- Mention any edge cases or special handling for zero denominators
- State that nan is a valid return value
- Provide any examples with all-False vectors

2. Mathematical Background:
The Dice coefficient (Sørensen-Dice) is a well-established similarity metric:
- Formula: 2|A∩B| / (|A| + |B|)
- Range: [0, 1] where 0 means no similarity and 1 means perfect similarity
- Dissimilarity = 1 - similarity

Mathematical convention for identical empty sets:
- The literature is not unanimous on this edge case
- Some sources suggest returning 1 (perfect similarity) when both sets are empty
- The identity property of metrics states d(x, x) = 0 for any x

3. Metric Properties:
As a dissimilarity metric, dice should satisfy:
- Non-negativity: d(x, y) >= 0
- Identity: d(x, x) = 0
- Symmetry: d(x, y) = d(y, x)

The current behavior (returning nan) violates:
- The identity property (nan ≠ 0)
- The non-negativity property (nan is not >= 0)
- The expected range [0, 1]

4. Comparison with Related Functions:
- Jaccard coefficient handles all-False vectors by returning 0.0
- Most other boolean dissimilarity metrics in scipy return 0.0 for identical all-False vectors
- Only sokalsneath explicitly raises an error for this case

5. User Expectations:
Based on common sense and metric theory:
- Two identical vectors should have dissimilarity 0, regardless of their content
- The function should return a valid number in [0, 1], not nan
- If the operation is undefined, it should raise an explicit error (like sokalsneath)

Conclusion:
The documentation does not explicitly define behavior for all-False vectors, but mathematical principles and consistency with other metrics strongly suggest that returning 0.0 (not nan) is the correct behavior for identical vectors, even when all-False.
