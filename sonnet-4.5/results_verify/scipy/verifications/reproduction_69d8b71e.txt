## Reproduction of the Bug

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported for scipy.io.hb_write when handling empty sparse matrices.

### Property-Based Test
The hypothesis test case fails exactly as described:
- Input: rows=1, cols=1, sparsity=0.5 (generates a 1x1 matrix of all zeros)
- Result: ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity
- Error location: scipy/io/_harwell_boeing/hb.py line 79

### Simple Reproduction
The simple test case with a 10x10 zero matrix also fails with the same error:
```python
A = csc_array(np.zeros((10, 10)))
scipy.io.hb_write(fname, A)
```
Result: Same ValueError at the same location in the code.

### Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurs because:
1. When a sparse matrix has no non-zero elements, the `indices` array is empty
2. The code tries to compute `np.max(indices+1)` on line 79
3. NumPy's max() function cannot operate on an empty array without an identity element
4. This causes a ValueError crash

### Verification of Claims
1. **Empty sparse matrices are valid**: Confirmed - a sparse matrix with nnz=0 is a valid mathematical and computational construct
2. **mmwrite handles empty matrices correctly**: Verified - scipy.io.mmwrite successfully writes and reads back empty sparse matrices
3. **The crash is unexpected**: Confirmed - the function crashes with a low-level NumPy error rather than handling the edge case gracefully

The bug is real, reproducible, and occurs exactly as described in the report.
