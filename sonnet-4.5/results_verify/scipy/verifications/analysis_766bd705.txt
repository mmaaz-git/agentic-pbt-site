## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Considering each possible categorization:

#### 1. BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation makes an unconditional mathematical claim: "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x"
- This claim is demonstrably false for all even-length arrays
- The functions are documented as being inverses of each other, yet they fail to invert for even-length arrays
- The error is significant (not just numerical precision) - entire signal components are lost
- Users would reasonably expect the round-trip property to work based on the documentation

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation does mention "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero"
- This might be a known mathematical limitation of discrete Hilbert transforms

#### 2. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments For:**
- The core issue is that the documentation makes a false claim without qualification
- The functions might be working as mathematically intended for discrete signals
- The Nyquist frequency handling for even-length arrays is a fundamental property of discrete Fourier transforms
- The fix would be to update the documentation to state the round-trip property only holds for odd-length arrays
- This is the most conservative fix that maintains backward compatibility

**Arguments Against:**
- Users expect hilbert and ihilbert to be true inverses based on their names and descriptions
- The loss of information is complete, not just approximate

#### 3. INVALID
**Arguments For:**
- The documentation does mention the Nyquist mode is zeroed for even-length arrays
- This might be expected behavior in signal processing contexts

**Arguments Against:**
- The documentation explicitly states a round-trip property without qualifications
- The Nyquist note is presented as an implementation detail, not a limitation
- The bug report correctly identifies a discrepancy between documented and actual behavior

#### 4. WONTFIX
**Arguments For:**
- Changing the behavior might break existing code that depends on current implementation
- The mathematical limitation might be inherent to discrete Hilbert transforms

**Arguments Against:**
- This is not a trivial issue - complete loss of signal components is significant
- The documentation makes explicit claims that are violated

#### 5. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments For:**
- Could be viewed as a request for better handling of even-length arrays
- Might require new algorithms to preserve Nyquist information

**Arguments Against:**
- The bug report is about existing functionality not working as documented
- Not asking for new features, just for documented behavior to work

### Mathematical Context:

After investigation, the issue stems from a fundamental property of the discrete Hilbert transform:
- For even-length signals, the Nyquist frequency (highest frequency) has no "negative frequency" counterpart
- The Hilbert transform applies a sign function to frequency components
- At the Nyquist frequency, the sign is ambiguous (it's both positive and negative)
- The implementation chooses to zero it out to maintain real-valued outputs

This is a known limitation in discrete signal processing, not a simple coding error.

### Conclusion:

This is a **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. The implementation appears to be following standard discrete signal processing conventions, but the documentation fails to accurately describe the limitations. The claim that "hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x" for zero-sum signals is only true for odd-length arrays, and this crucial limitation must be documented.
