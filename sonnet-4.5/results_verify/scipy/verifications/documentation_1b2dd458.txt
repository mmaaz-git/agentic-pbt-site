DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR scipy.sparse.csgraph.csgraph_from_dense
=====================================================================

Official Documentation Found:
----------------------------
From the SciPy documentation and built-in help:

Function signature: csgraph_from_dense(graph, null_value=0, nan_null=True, infinity_null=True)

Purpose: "Construct a CSR-format sparse graph from a dense matrix."

Parameters:
- graph: Input graph. Shape should be (n_nodes, n_nodes)
- null_value: "Value that denotes non-edges in the graph. Default is zero."
- nan_null: If True (default), then NaN entries are treated as non-edges
- infinity_null: If True (default), then infinite entries (both positive and negative) are treated as null edges

Returns: Compressed sparse representation of graph

Key Documentation Points:
1. The documentation states that null_value is "Value that denotes non-edges in the graph"
2. There is NO mention of tolerance or approximate comparison
3. The documentation suggests exact value matching ("denotes")
4. The module documentation shows examples where null_value is used with np.inf, suggesting exact comparison

Source Code Investigation:
-------------------------
The implementation uses numpy.ma.masked_values() internally, which I discovered has the following behavior:

1. numpy.ma.masked_values() uses floating-point approximate equality, NOT exact equality
2. Default parameters are rtol=1e-05 and atol=1e-08
3. Values are masked if: |value - null_value| <= atol + rtol * |null_value|

Documentation Gap:
-----------------
The documentation does NOT mention that:
1. Floating-point approximate comparison is used
2. Values close to null_value (within tolerance) will also be treated as non-edges
3. The specific tolerance values (rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-8) used internally

This is a significant documentation omission because users would reasonably expect exact comparison based on the wording "value that denotes non-edges". The word "denotes" suggests a specific, exact value, not a range of values.
