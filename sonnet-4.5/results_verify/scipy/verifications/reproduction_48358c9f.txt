## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Test Execution

When running the test code with `step_factor=0.0`:

```python
from scipy.differentiate import derivative
import numpy as np

result = derivative(np.sin, 1.0, step_factor=0.0)
```

**Expected behavior (per bug report)**: A `ValueError` should be raised during input validation with a message about `step_factor` needing to be positive.

**Actual behavior observed**:
- The function does NOT raise a `ValueError` during input validation
- Instead, it proceeds with execution and encounters multiple runtime warnings about division by zero
- Returns a result object with `success: False`, `status: -3` (non-finite value encountered), and `df: nan`

### Runtime Warnings Observed

The following warnings were generated during execution:
1. `RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in divide` at line 468: `hc = h / c**xp.arange(n, dtype=work.dtype)`
2. `RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in divide` at line 474: `hr = h / d**xp.arange(2*n, dtype=work.dtype)`
3. Multiple additional division by zero warnings at various other lines (678, 700, 542)
4. `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in sin` when trying to evaluate the function with invalid values

### Code Analysis

I examined the source code at `/home/npc/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/differentiate/_differentiate.py`:

1. **Lines 27-33 (Input Validation)**: The validation code indeed checks `np.any(tols < 0)` which allows `step_factor=0` to pass since `0 >= 0`:
```python
message = 'Tolerances and step parameters must be non-negative scalars.'
tols = np.asarray([atol if atol is not None else 1,
                   rtol if rtol is not None else 1,
                   step_factor])
if (not np.issubdtype(tols.dtype, np.number) or np.any(tols < 0)
        or np.any(np.isnan(tols)) or tols.shape != (3,)):
    raise ValueError(message)
```

2. **Line 468 (Division by Zero)**: When `step_factor=0`, the code `c**xp.arange(n, dtype=work.dtype)` produces `[1, 0, 0, ...]` leading to division by zero:
```python
hc = h / c**xp.arange(n, dtype=work.dtype)
```

### Conclusion

The bug report is accurate. The function accepts `step_factor=0` during input validation but this causes division by zero errors during computation, resulting in NaN outputs instead of a proper error message. The validation should reject `step_factor=0` upfront.
