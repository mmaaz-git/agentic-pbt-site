DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS FOR scipy.sparse COO Matrix has_canonical_format Flag

1. WHAT IS has_canonical_format:
According to the scipy documentation, has_canonical_format is a boolean attribute that indicates whether a sparse matrix has:
- Sorted indices (by row, then column for COO)
- No duplicate entries (no duplicate (i,j) coordinates)

The documentation states that "has_canonical_format implies has_sorted_indices", meaning if has_canonical_format is True, has_sorted_indices is automatically True as well.

2. CANONICAL FORMAT FOR COO MATRICES:
The documentation explicitly defines canonical format for COO matrices as:
- "Entries and coordinates sorted by row, then column"
- "No duplicate entries (i.e. duplicate (i,j) locations)"
- "Data arrays MAY have explicit zeros"

3. COO TO CSR CONVERSION BEHAVIOR:
The documentation states that "by default... duplicate (i,j) entries will be summed together" when converting COO to CSR format. This is a key feature for efficiently constructing matrices, particularly finite element matrices.

4. CSR FORMAT PROPERTIES:
CSR documentation indicates that:
- Duplicate entries are automatically summed when creating a CSR matrix
- The canonical CSR format has "Within each row, indices are sorted by column" and "There are no duplicate entries"
- CSR format inherently cannot have duplicate coordinates due to its compressed storage structure

5. MISSING DOCUMENTATION:
The documentation does NOT explicitly state:
- What the has_canonical_format flag should be after converting from CSR back to COO
- Any guarantees about the has_canonical_format state after format conversions
- Whether tocoo() from CSR should set has_canonical_format to True

6. KEY OBSERVATION:
The documentation shows that to get a COO matrix with has_canonical_format=True, one must call sum_duplicates() on the COO matrix. Fresh COO matrices created with coo_matrix() constructor have has_canonical_format=False by default, even when they contain no duplicates.

7. IMPLICIT EXPECTATIONS:
While not explicitly documented, there is a reasonable expectation that:
- Since CSR format cannot have duplicate coordinates (they are summed during construction)
- A COO matrix created from CSR should logically have no duplicates
- Therefore, has_canonical_format should be True for COO matrices created from CSR

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly specify the expected behavior of has_canonical_format when converting CSR to COO, leaving this as an undocumented edge case. However, the logical interpretation of the format definitions suggests that COO matrices from CSR should have has_canonical_format=True.
