TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Considering each possible categorization:

## INVALID
Arguments FOR:
- The behavior is explicitly documented in PPoly.solve() documentation
- The documentation states that for identically zero sections, the return is [start_point, nan]
- The code is behaving exactly as documented and designed
- The NaN is intentional - it's a sentinel value indicating infinite roots in the interval
- The bug reporter's assertion that "NaN is not a valid root value" is incorrect per the documentation

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation for roots() itself doesn't mention this behavior
- NaN values can cause issues in downstream calculations

## BUG
Arguments FOR:
- PPoly.roots() documentation doesn't explicitly mention NaN returns
- NaN values propagating through calculations could be problematic
- The API could be clearer about this behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- The behavior is explicitly documented in solve() which roots() uses
- The implementation matches the documented specification exactly
- This is a deliberate design choice, not an oversight

## WONTFIX
Arguments FOR:
- This is an edge case (constant zero polynomials)
- The behavior is documented in solve()
- Changing it would break backward compatibility

Arguments AGAINST:
- This isn't really a bug to begin with, so WONTFIX doesn't apply

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX
Arguments FOR:
- The PPoly.roots() documentation could be clearer about this behavior
- It would be helpful to explicitly mention the NaN sentinel value in roots() docs
- Cross-referencing solve() documentation would improve clarity

Arguments AGAINST:
- The solve() documentation already covers this clearly
- The current documentation is technically complete

## FEATURE_REQUEST
Arguments FOR:
- The reporter wants different behavior (empty array or exception)
- Could be seen as requesting an alternative API

Arguments AGAINST:
- The current behavior is intentional and documented
- This would be a breaking change to existing API

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

The most appropriate categorization is INVALID because:

1. The behavior is EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED in the PPoly.solve() documentation
2. The exact quote: "If the piecewise polynomial contains sections that are identically zero, the root list will contain the start point of the interval, followed by a `nan` value"
3. PPoly.roots() is documented to use solve() internally
4. The implementation precisely matches the documented specification
5. The NaN is not a "bug" but a deliberate sentinel value indicating infinite roots
6. The bug report's core claim that "NaN is not a valid root value" contradicts the documentation

While a DOCUMENTATION_FIX could improve clarity by adding this note to roots() documentation as well, the primary issue raised in the bug report (that returning NaN is wrong) is invalid per the existing documentation.
