DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

After reviewing the official SciPy documentation:

1. PPoly.roots() documentation (scipy.interpolate.PPoly.roots):
   - States it "Find real roots of the piecewise polynomial"
   - Returns "ndarray" of roots
   - No explicit mention of NaN values in return

2. PPoly.solve() documentation (scipy.interpolate.PPoly.solve):
   - CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: The documentation explicitly states:
     "If the piecewise polynomial contains sections that are identically zero,
      the root list will contain the start point of the interval, followed by a `nan` value"
   - Since roots() internally calls solve(0), this behavior applies to roots() as well

3. Key finding:
   The behavior described in the bug report (returning [start_point, nan] for constant zero polynomials)
   is EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED in the PPoly.solve() documentation.

4. Documentation consistency:
   - The PPoly.roots() documentation doesn't mention this special case
   - However, since roots() is implemented as solve(0), the solve() documentation applies
   - The behavior is intentional and documented, not a bug

5. Semantic interpretation:
   - For a constant zero polynomial, every point in the interval is technically a root
   - SciPy chose to represent this as [start_point, nan] by design
   - The NaN serves as a sentinel value indicating "infinite roots in this interval"

CONCLUSION: The behavior is documented and intentional, not a bug in the implementation.
