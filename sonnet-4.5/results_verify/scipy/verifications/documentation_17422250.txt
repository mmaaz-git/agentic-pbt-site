DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

Documentation Review for scipy.io.matlab.savemat appendmat Parameter
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION (from docstring and online docs):

   The savemat function documentation clearly states:

   - Parameter: "appendmat : bool, optional"
   - Description: "True (the default) to append the .mat extension to the end of the
     given filename, if not already present."

   This is unambiguous: when appendmat=True, the function SHOULD append ".mat" to
   the filename if it's not already present.

2. PARAMETER NAME SEMANTICS:

   The parameter name "appendmat" itself strongly implies "append mat extension".
   This creates a clear expectation about the behavior.

3. DOCUMENTATION IN loadmat FOR COMPARISON:

   The loadmat function has identical documentation for its appendmat parameter:
   "True to append the .mat extension to the end of the given filename, if not
   already present. Default is True."

   This creates an expectation of symmetry between load and save operations.

4. CODE COMMENTS IN _open_file:

   The internal _open_file function (line 29-30) states:
   "If that fails, and `file_like` is a string, and `appendmat` is true,
   append '.mat' and try again."

   This comment describes what ACTUALLY happens (only append on failure), but this
   is an implementation detail that contradicts the public API documentation.

5. EXAMPLES IN DOCUMENTATION:

   The savemat example shows:
   >>> savemat("matlab_matrix.mat", mdic)

   It uses the full filename with extension, which doesn't demonstrate the appendmat
   behavior, but also doesn't contradict the documented behavior.

CONCLUSION ON DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------------
The documentation is CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS that appendmat=True should append the
.mat extension if not present. The current implementation violates this documented
behavior. This is NOT a case of ambiguous or missing documentation - the documentation
explicitly promises a behavior that the code does not deliver.

The bug report correctly identifies that the implementation does not match the
documented API contract. Users have a reasonable expectation based on:
1. The explicit documentation promise
2. The parameter name itself
3. The symmetry with loadmat behavior
4. Common conventions for file extension handling
