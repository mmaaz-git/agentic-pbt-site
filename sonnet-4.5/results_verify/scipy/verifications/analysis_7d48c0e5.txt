## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Why it might be a BUG:**
- The error message "zero-length FFT requested" is factually incorrect and misleading when the input has length 1
- Poor user experience: users get a confusing error that doesn't explain the actual issue
- Inconsistent error handling: while the constraint is documented, the runtime error doesn't reflect the documentation
- The proposed fix in the bug report (adding proper validation with clear error message) would improve usability

### INVALID (Not a Valid Bug)
**Why it might be INVALID:**
- The documentation clearly states "Type 1 DCT requires input size > 1"
- The behavior is mathematically correct: DCT-I is undefined for N < 2
- The function is behaving as documented, just with a poor error message
- The crash is expected based on the documented constraint

### WONTFIX (Trivial Issue)
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
- Users who read the documentation will know about the constraint
- The error still prevents incorrect usage, even if the message is confusing
- DCT Type 1 is rarely used compared to Type 2 (the default)
- Single-element DCT is an edge case that rarely occurs in practice

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The constraint IS already documented
- The issue is primarily about communication/clarity rather than functionality
- Making the documentation more prominent might be sufficient

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Asking for better error messages could be considered a feature enhancement
- The request to "handle single elements gracefully" goes beyond the mathematical definition
- Adding special case handling for N=1 would be new functionality

## Final Assessment

This is primarily a **usability issue** rather than a functional bug. The key factors are:

1. **The behavior is documented** - The documentation states Type 1 DCT requires input size > 1
2. **The behavior is mathematically correct** - DCT-I is undefined for N < 2
3. **The error message is misleading** - "zero-length FFT requested" for a length-1 input is confusing
4. **The proposed fix is reasonable** - Adding proper validation with a clear error message would improve user experience

The most appropriate categorization is **FEATURE_REQUEST** because:
- The function works as documented and mathematically intended
- The request is for better error handling and clearer messaging
- This is an enhancement to improve usability, not a fix for incorrect behavior
- The suggestion to add validation with a descriptive error message is a valid improvement

While one could argue for WONTFIX (since it's documented and rare), the misleading error message causes unnecessary confusion. A simple validation check with a clear error message would be a valuable improvement to the library's usability.
