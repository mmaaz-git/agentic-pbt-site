## Documentation Analysis for scipy.signal.deconvolve

### 1. Documented Mathematical Property

The function's docstring explicitly and unambiguously states:

"Returns the quotient and remainder such that
`signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder`"

This is presented as a mathematical identity that should hold for all valid inputs. The documentation makes no mention of:
- This being an approximation
- Numerical limitations or instability concerns
- Conditions under which this property might not hold
- Any tolerance or acceptable error bounds

### 2. Implementation Details

Looking at the source code (lines 2414-2473 in _signaltools.py), the implementation uses:
```python
quot = lfilter(num, den, input)
rem = num - convolve(den, quot, mode='full')
```

The function uses `lfilter` for the deconvolution operation when D â‰¤ N, which is known to have numerical stability issues with certain coefficient ratios.

### 3. Related Documentation

The function references `numpy.polydiv` in "See Also", noting it "performs polynomial division (same operation, but also accepts poly1d objects)". This suggests deconvolve is intended to be equivalent to polynomial division when working with arrays.

### 4. Example in Documentation

The provided example uses simple, well-conditioned inputs:
- original = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
- impulse_response = [2, 1]

This example works perfectly, but it doesn't represent the full range of inputs the function might receive. The coefficients have a small ratio (2:1), unlike the failing case (1.25:79299).

### 5. Missing Warnings

Critically absent from the documentation:
- No warnings about numerical stability
- No mention of potential precision loss with large coefficient ratios
- No guidance on when the function might produce inaccurate results
- No tolerance specifications for the mathematical property

### 6. Contractual Obligation

The documentation presents the mathematical property as a guarantee without qualifications. Users have every right to expect this property to hold within reasonable numerical precision (e.g., machine epsilon or a small multiple thereof). The actual errors (451.0 in our test) are many orders of magnitude beyond what could be considered acceptable numerical error.

### Conclusion

The documentation unequivocally promises that `signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder`. There are no caveats, warnings, or mentions of numerical limitations. The implementation fails to deliver on this documented guarantee for certain inputs, making this a clear violation of the documented behavior rather than undefined behavior or a documentation issue.
