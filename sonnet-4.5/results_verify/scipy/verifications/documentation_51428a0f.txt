DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

I have thoroughly reviewed the scipy.integrate.cumulative_simpson documentation and source code. Here are the key findings:

1. FUNCTION PURPOSE (from documentation):
"Cumulatively integrate y(x) using the composite Simpson's 1/3 rule. The integral of the samples at every point is calculated by assuming a quadratic relationship between each point and the two adjacent points."

2. KEY DOCUMENTATION STATEMENTS:

a) Algorithm Description:
The documentation explicitly states that the function "assumes a quadratic relationship between each point and the two adjacent points." This means for computing the cumulative value at index i, the function uses points at indices i-1, i, and i+1.

b) Comparison with Iterative Simpson:
The documentation notes: "The output of cumulative_simpson is similar to that of iteratively calling simpson with successively higher upper limits of integration, but not identical."

It then provides an example showing that the results differ, with the comment: "This is expected: because cumulative_simpson has access to more information than simpson, it can typically produce more accurate estimates of the underlying integral over subintervals."

c) Mathematical Formula:
The documentation provides the exact formula used (equation 8 from Cartwright's paper), which shows how the integral from x1 to x2 is calculated using points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), and (x3,y3). This confirms the use of a future point (x3,y3) to calculate past integrals.

3. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT SPECIFY:

a) Causality Requirement:
The documentation does NOT explicitly state that cumulative integrals should only use past data. It does not claim to compute cumulative[i] using only y[0:i+1].

b) Monotonicity Guarantee:
The documentation does NOT guarantee that cumulative integrals of non-negative functions will be monotonically increasing.

c) Non-negativity Guarantee:
The documentation does NOT guarantee that cumulative integrals of non-negative functions will remain non-negative.

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FROM SOURCE CODE:

The source code confirms the algorithm:
- Uses _cumulative_simpson_equal_intervals or _cumulative_simpson_unequal_intervals
- These functions compute integrals using triplets of points (f1, f2, f3)
- The formula explicitly uses f3 (future point) with a negative coefficient, which can lead to negative intermediate values

5. REFERENCE PAPER:
The implementation follows Cartwright's paper "Simpson's Rule Cumulative Integration with MS Excel and Irregularly-spaced Data", which describes this specific algorithm that uses future points.

CONCLUSION:
The documentation accurately describes what the function does - it uses a quadratic fit through three points (including future points) to compute cumulative integrals. The documentation does NOT claim that this produces mathematically correct cumulative integrals in the traditional sense. The behavior observed (negative values, non-monotonicity) appears to be the intended behavior based on the documented algorithm, not a bug in implementation.
