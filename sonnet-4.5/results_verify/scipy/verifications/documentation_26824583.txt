## Documentation Analysis

### scipy.io.arff.loadarff Documentation

The official scipy documentation states that loadarff raises:
1. **ParseArffError**: "if the given file is not ARFF-formatted"
2. **NotImplementedError**: if "The ARFF file has an attribute which is not supported yet"

The documentation does NOT mention:
- Any restrictions on duplicate attribute names
- ValueError as a possible exception
- How duplicate attribute names should be handled

### ARFF Format Specification

From the Weka ARFF format documentation:
1. The specification states that each "@attribute" statement should "uniquely define the name of that attribute"
2. While not explicitly prohibiting duplicates, the wording suggests unique names are expected
3. Attribute names have naming restrictions (cannot begin with certain characters) but duplicate names are not explicitly addressed

### Code Comments

The source code at line 870 in _arffread.py contains a revealing comment:
```python
# No error should happen here: it is a bug otherwise
data = np.array(a, [(a.name, a.dtype) for a in attr])
```

This comment explicitly acknowledges that any error at this point indicates a bug in the code's logic.

### Conclusion

The documentation does not specify how duplicate attribute names should be handled, but:
1. The ARFF specification suggests attributes should be uniquely named
2. The code comment admits that errors at line 871 are bugs
3. The current behavior (ValueError from NumPy) contradicts the documented exception types (ParseArffError or NotImplementedError)

The documentation gap combined with the code comment strongly suggests this is a legitimate bug that should be fixed by adding proper validation during header parsing.
