Bug Report Categorization Analysis
==================================

## Considering Each Category

### BUG (Valid Bug Report)
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation explicitly states "Must be a positive integer" which mathematically excludes 0
- There's inconsistent behavior: negative values raise ValueError, but 0 doesn't
- The returned value (0) is not a valid 5-smooth number as documented
- The returned value causes downstream errors in FFT operations
- The underlying _helper.good_size correctly rejects -1 but not 0, showing partial validation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None significant - the documentation is clear and the behavior violates it

### INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could argue that 0 might be considered a valid edge case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation explicitly says "positive integer" which excludes 0
- Negative values correctly raise errors, showing input validation exists
- The inconsistency between -1 and 0 handling suggests this is a bug, not design

### WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be considered an obscure edge case (passing 0 to FFT length finder)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure case - 0 is a common boundary value to test
- The function already validates negative inputs, so fixing 0 is consistent
- The fix is trivial (one line change)
- Causes actual errors in downstream FFT operations

### DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could change documentation to say "non-negative integer" instead of "positive"

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The current behavior (returning 0) doesn't make sense functionally
- 0 is not a valid FFT length and causes errors when used
- The documentation correctly describes what the function should do
- Changing docs to allow 0 would legitimize broken behavior

### FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- None - this is clearly about existing functionality not working as documented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not requesting new functionality
- The documentation already specifies the expected behavior

## Conclusion
This is clearly a BUG. The function violates its documented contract by accepting 0 when it should only accept positive integers. The inconsistency with negative value handling, the unusable return value, and the clear documentation all point to this being a legitimate bug that should be fixed.
