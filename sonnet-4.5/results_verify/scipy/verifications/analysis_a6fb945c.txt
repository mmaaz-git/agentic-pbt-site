# Triage Analysis for scipy.special logit/expit Bug Report

## Consideration for Each Category

### 1. BUG (Valid bug that should be filed)

**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation explicitly states these functions are inverses without qualification
- The provided examples reinforce the inverse relationship claim
- Users would reasonably expect logit(expit(40)) = 40 based on the documentation
- The failure is not due to extreme edge cases but occurs at moderate values (x >= 27 shows errors)
- The issue affects a common use case (inverse transformations in machine learning/statistics)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is inherently a floating point precision limitation, not a logic error
- The functions individually work correctly; the issue only appears in composition

### 2. INVALID (Incorrect report, functions work as designed)

**Arguments FOR:**
- Floating point limitations are well-known in numerical computing
- The individual functions (logit and expit) work correctly according to their mathematical definitions
- expit(40) correctly returns 1.0 within floating point precision
- logit(1.0) correctly returns inf as documented

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation claims they are inverses without any caveats
- Users shouldn't need deep numerical analysis knowledge to use these functions
- The documentation examples suggest the inverse relationship always works

### 3. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting issue)

**Arguments FOR:**
- This might be considered an inherent limitation of floating point arithmetic
- The issue only affects relatively large values (x >= 27)
- Most practical applications might not use such large values

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- x=27 is not an obscure edge case - it's a reasonable value in many applications
- The complete failure at x=40 (returning inf) is a serious issue
- This affects the reliability of code using these functions for round-trip operations

### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)

**Arguments FOR:**
- Requesting better numerical stability could be seen as an enhancement
- The current implementation follows the mathematical definition correctly

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation already claims this functionality exists ("It is the inverse")
- This isn't asking for new functionality but for documented behavior to work

### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation needs updating)

**Arguments FOR:**
- The code behavior is mathematically correct given floating point limitations
- Simply adding a warning about numerical limitations would resolve the issue
- The individual functions work correctly; only the composition has issues
- This is a fundamental limitation of floating point arithmetic, not a code bug
- Changing documentation is easier and safer than modifying numerical algorithms

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Users expect documented behavior to work as stated
- The library could potentially implement better numerical methods to handle this

## Most Appropriate Category Analysis

This issue falls into a gray area between BUG and DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The key considerations are:

1. **User Expectations**: The documentation creates a clear expectation that these functions are true inverses, reinforced by examples.

2. **Numerical Reality**: The issue is caused by fundamental floating point limitations when expit(x) approaches 1.0.

3. **Severity**: The error becomes significant at x=27 (4e-5 error), large at x=35 (5% error), and complete failure at x>=40 (inf).

4. **Practical Impact**: Values like x=27 to x=40 are not extreme edge cases in many statistical and machine learning applications.

5. **Solution Feasibility**: While better numerical methods might help, the fundamental limitation of representing numbers very close to 1.0 remains.

## Final Assessment

Given that:
- The documentation makes an unqualified claim about the inverse relationship
- The examples reinforce this claim without showing limitations
- The failure occurs at reasonable values (not extreme edge cases)
- The issue could mislead users and cause bugs in production code

This should be categorized as **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. The functions work correctly according to their mathematical definitions, but the documentation fails to acknowledge the inherent numerical limitations of the inverse relationship. The documentation should be updated to:
1. Clarify that the inverse relationship is approximate due to floating point limitations
2. Warn about precision loss for large |x| values
3. Provide examples that demonstrate these limitations
