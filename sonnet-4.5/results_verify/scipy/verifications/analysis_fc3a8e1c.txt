TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID - Why it might be INVALID:
--------------------------------------
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state initial_step must be positive
- The function technically "works" (returns a result) with non-positive values
- One could argue the user should know that a step size of 0 doesn't make mathematical sense

Why it's NOT INVALID:
- The error message at line 27 explicitly states "step parameters must be non-negative"
- The code at line 408 treats h0 <= 0 as invalid (converts to NaN)
- step_factor (another step parameter) IS validated for being non-negative
- The mathematical operation requires a non-zero step size
- The current behavior is confusing and unhelpful to users

2. WONTFIX - Why it might be WONTFIX:
--------------------------------------
- Users who pass 0 or negative step sizes are making an obvious mistake
- The function eventually fails with a status code indicating the problem
- It's a minor issue that only affects users who pass invalid inputs

Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
- This is not an obscure edge case - initial_step is a primary parameter
- The fix is trivial and improves user experience significantly
- Other similar parameters (step_factor) already have this validation
- The current behavior violates the principle of fail-fast with clear errors
- SciPy generally values good error messages and input validation

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX - Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
----------------------------------------------------------
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state initial_step must be positive
- One could update docs to say "must be positive" and leave the code as-is
- The code's behavior (converting to NaN) could be documented as intended

Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The error message already claims to validate "step parameters"
- The code already treats non-positive values as invalid (line 408)
- The inconsistency between step_factor validation and initial_step non-validation suggests a bug
- Documenting bad behavior doesn't make it correct

4. FEATURE_REQUEST - Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
------------------------------------------------------
- Adding validation could be seen as a new feature
- The current code doesn't crash, it just gives unhelpful results

Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
- Input validation for similar parameters already exists
- The error message already claims this validation should exist
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

5. BUG - Why it IS a BUG:
-------------------------
STRONG EVIDENCE:
- The error message at line 27 explicitly states "step parameters must be non-negative scalars"
- step_factor (another step parameter) IS validated using this exact error message
- initial_step is clearly a "step parameter" but is NOT validated
- The code at line 408 shows the developer knew h0 <= 0 was invalid (converts to NaN)
- The validation function _derivative_iv is supposed to validate inputs but misses this one
- The current behavior (silent NaN conversion) violates fail-fast principles
- Users get a cryptic status=-3 instead of a clear ValueError about initial_step

CONSISTENCY ARGUMENT:
- If step_factor must be non-negative and gets validated
- And initial_step is also a step parameter
- Then initial_step should also be validated
- The fact that it's not is an oversight/bug in the validation logic

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Current: Pass initial_step=0, get success=False with status=-3 and df=nan
- Expected: Pass initial_step=0, get clear ValueError about invalid initial_step
- This is clearly a bug in user experience and API consistency

DEVELOPER INTENT:
- Line 408 shows the developer knew non-positive values were invalid
- The error message mentions "step parameters" plural
- The validation function name suggests it should validate all inputs
- This appears to be an oversight where validation was forgotten
