REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs exactly as described:

1. **Basic Reproduction**: When calling scipy.sparse.linalg.inv() with a 1x1 sparse matrix:
   - Input: sp.csc_array([[2.0]]) - a 1x1 sparse CSC array
   - Output: numpy.ndarray([0.5]) - a 1D numpy array, NOT a sparse array

2. **Composability Failure**: The bug breaks function composability:
   - inv(inv(A)) fails for 1x1 matrices with TypeError: "Input must be a sparse arrays"
   - This is because the first inv() returns an ndarray, which cannot be passed to inv() again

3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: For larger matrices (e.g., 2x2), inv() correctly returns a sparse array:
   - 2x2 sparse matrix input returns scipy.sparse._csc.csc_array as expected
   - Only 1x1 matrices exhibit this problematic behavior

4. **Hypothesis Test Failure**: The property-based test fails immediately when n=1:
   - The test expects inv(inv(A)) to work for all matrix sizes
   - It crashes with TypeError when attempting the second inversion on the 1x1 case

The bug is real and occurs exactly as described in the report. The function returns an inconsistent type (ndarray vs sparse array) based on the input size, violating the principle of type consistency and breaking the documented API contract.
