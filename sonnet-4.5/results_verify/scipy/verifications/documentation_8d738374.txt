Documentation Analysis for scipy.io.matlab.savemat oned_as Parameter
=====================================================================

Based on reviewing the official scipy documentation and the function's docstring, here are the key findings:

1. **Parameter Definition**:
   - The `oned_as` parameter is an optional parameter with default value 'row'
   - Accepted values: 'row' or 'column'
   - Purpose: Controls how 1-D NumPy arrays are written to MATLAB .mat files

2. **Documented Behavior**:
   From the docstring:
   - If 'column': "write 1-D NumPy arrays as column vectors"
   - If 'row': "write 1-D NumPy arrays as row vectors"

3. **What the Documentation DOES Say**:
   - The parameter specifically applies to "1-D NumPy arrays"
   - Row vectors and column vectors are the two output options
   - This is consistent with MATLAB's convention where vectors are 2D matrices

4. **What the Documentation DOES NOT Say**:
   - There is NO specific mention of how empty 1D arrays should be handled
   - There is NO exception or special case documented for arrays with size 0
   - There is NO statement that empty arrays would be treated differently
   - The documentation does not distinguish between empty and non-empty 1D arrays

5. **Reasonable Interpretation**:
   Given that:
   - A 1D array with shape (3,) becomes (1, 3) with oned_as='row'
   - A 1D array with shape (3,) becomes (3, 1) with oned_as='column'

   The natural expectation would be:
   - A 1D array with shape (0,) should become (1, 0) with oned_as='row'
   - A 1D array with shape (0,) should become (0, 1) with oned_as='column'

   This maintains the dimensional transformation pattern: for row vectors, prepend a dimension of size 1; for column vectors, append a dimension of size 1.

6. **Documentation Completeness**:
   The documentation is clear about the general behavior but does not explicitly address edge cases. Since empty arrays are valid 1D NumPy arrays, and the documentation states the parameter applies to "1-D NumPy arrays" without qualification, it's reasonable to expect consistent behavior for all 1D arrays regardless of their size.
