BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS

I successfully reproduced the reported bug exactly as described. Here are the findings:

1. EXACT REPRODUCTION CASE (from bug report):
   - DataFrame with 5 rows, requesting 7 chunks
   - Result: Got 7 chunks total, with 2 empty chunks (chunks 5 and 6)
   - Output matches exactly what the bug report claimed

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST:
   - The hypothesis test from the bug report runs and fails as expected
   - Testing n_rows=5, n_chunks=7 produces 2 empty chunks
   - Running the full hypothesis test suite shows the bug occurs consistently whenever n_chunks > n_rows
   - Examples of failures:
     * n_rows=1, n_chunks=2: 1 empty chunk
     * n_rows=3, n_chunks=10: 7 empty chunks
     * n_rows=54, n_chunks=189: 135 empty chunks

3. ADDITIONAL EDGE CASES TESTED:
   - When n_chunks > n_rows: Empty chunks are always created
   - When n_chunks == n_rows: No empty chunks (works correctly)
   - When n_chunks < n_rows: No empty chunks (works correctly)

4. COLUMN IMPLEMENTATION:
   - PandasColumn.get_chunks() has the exact same issue
   - Series with 5 elements, requesting 7 chunks produces 2 empty chunks
   - The bug affects both DataFrame and Column implementations identically

5. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BUG:
   The code in both implementations uses this logic:
   ```python
   if n_chunks and n_chunks > 1:
       size = len(self._df)  # or len(self._col)
       step = size // n_chunks
       if size % n_chunks != 0:
           step += 1
       for start in range(0, step * n_chunks, step):
           yield chunk[start : start + step]
   ```

   When n_chunks=7 and size=5:
   - step = 5 // 7 = 0
   - Since 5 % 7 != 0, step becomes 1
   - The loop iterates from 0 to 7 with step 1
   - This creates chunks at indices [0:1], [1:2], [2:3], [3:4], [4:5], [5:6], [6:7]
   - The last two slices [5:6] and [6:7] are beyond the data bounds, creating empty chunks

6. VERIFICATION:
   - The bug is 100% reproducible
   - The behavior matches exactly what the bug report describes
   - Both the simple reproduction case and the property-based test confirm the issue
   - The suggested fix in the bug report (capping n_chunks at data size) would resolve the issue

The bug report's technical details are completely accurate.
