REPRODUCTION REPORT
===================

I have successfully reproduced the reported bug in scipy.sparse.linalg.spbandwidth.

Test Environment:
- Python 3.13
- SciPy version: tested with the installed version
- NumPy: available

Reproduction Methods:
1. Hypothesis Test: The property-based test fails immediately with n=1, density=0.0
2. Simple Test Case: Creating any zero sparse matrix triggers the error

Confirmed Behavior:
When calling spbandwidth on a sparse matrix with no non-zero elements (zero matrix), the function crashes with:
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity

This occurs at line 882 in linsolve.py:
    return max(-np.min(gap).item(), 0), max(np.max(gap).item(), 0)

The issue is that when a sparse matrix has no non-zero elements, the 'gap' array is empty,
and calling np.min() or np.max() on an empty array raises a ValueError.

Tested Cases:
- 1x1 zero matrix: Crashes
- 3x3 zero matrix: Crashes
- 5x5 zero matrix: Crashes
- Any sparse matrix with density=0.0: Crashes

The bug is 100% reproducible and occurs consistently for any sparse matrix with zero non-zero elements,
regardless of the matrix dimensions or sparse format used.
