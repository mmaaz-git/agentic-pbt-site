# Bug Report Triage Analysis

## Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
- The behavior violates the principle of least surprise - users would reasonably expect `get_window('hann', M)` to behave like `hann(M)`
- The inconsistency creates a trap for users migrating between the two APIs
- The name "get_window" suggests it's a simple dispatcher/wrapper, not that it changes default behavior
- This could lead to silent errors in signal processing code where the wrong window type is used

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior is technically correct according to the documentation
- Both functions clearly document their default parameters
- The different defaults may be intentional design choices for different use cases
- The code works as documented, just not as users might expect

## Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The functions behave exactly as documented
- The documentation clearly states `fftbins=True` is the default for get_window
- The documentation clearly states `sym=True` is the default for individual functions
- No documentation claims these functions should produce identical results with defaults
- The bug report's test is actually incorrect (compares sym=True with fftbins=True when it should compare sym=False with fftbins=True)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Just because behavior is documented doesn't mean it's not confusing or problematic
- The lack of warning about this difference is a documentation issue at minimum
- The principle of least surprise is violated

## Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- Changing the default would be a breaking change for existing code
- The different defaults may serve different primary use cases (FFT vs filter design)
- Users can easily work around this by specifying parameters explicitly
- The behavior has likely been this way for a long time

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects basic usage
- The inconsistency affects common window functions (hann, hamming, etc.)
- It's a source of potential bugs in scientific computing

## Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The code behavior is reasonable for the intended use cases
- The main issue is lack of clear warning about the difference in defaults
- Adding a warning to the documentation would help users avoid confusion
- Both behaviors (periodic and symmetric windows) are valid and useful
- The documentation should explicitly note this difference to prevent user confusion

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is more than just a documentation issue - it's an API design inconsistency
- Documentation alone won't prevent the surprise when code behaves unexpectedly

## Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- One could argue for a new parameter or function that provides consistent defaults
- Could request a new unified API with consistent behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is about existing functionality behaving inconsistently, not requesting new features
- The functions already exist and work, the issue is their default parameters

## Final Assessment
The strongest case is for **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. While the behavior is technically correct and documented, the lack of explicit warning about the different defaults between get_window and individual window functions is a documentation deficiency. The functions work as designed, but the design creates a trap for users. The best solution is to prominently document this difference, as suggested in the bug report's alternative fix.

The behavior appears intentional - get_window defaults to periodic windows (common for FFT), while individual functions default to symmetric windows (common for filter design). Changing this would be a breaking change. However, the documentation should explicitly warn users about this difference to prevent confusion and errors.
