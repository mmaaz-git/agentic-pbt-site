DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. FIND_SIMPLEX DOCUMENTATION:
   - Method signature: Delaunay.find_simplex(self, xi, bruteforce=False, tol=None)
   - Default tolerance is documented as "100*eps" where eps is machine epsilon (2.22e-16)
   - Returns -1 for points outside the triangulation
   - Uses algorithm adapted from Qhull's qh_findbestfacet

2. GENERAL DELAUNAY DOCUMENTATION:
   - Important note: "Unless you pass in the Qhull option 'QJ', Qhull does not guarantee that each input point appears as a vertex in the Delaunay triangulation"
   - However, this refers to points potentially being excluded from the triangulation, not about finding vertices that ARE included
   - Coplanar points that are not included are tracked separately

3. MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS:
   - Delaunay triangulation is a well-defined mathematical concept
   - By definition, every vertex of a triangulation must be part of at least one simplex
   - Vertices lie on boundaries between simplices, which can create ambiguity about which simplex to return
   - However, the function should return SOME valid simplex, not -1

4. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION DOESN'T SAY:
   - No explicit guarantee that vertices of the triangulation can always be found by find_simplex()
   - No warning about potential numerical issues when querying vertices
   - No recommendation to use a different tolerance when querying vertices
   - No mention that the default tolerance might be insufficient for vertices

5. RELATED INFORMATION:
   - The vertex_to_simplex attribute exists specifically to map vertices to simplices
   - This suggests that finding which simplex a vertex belongs to is a valid operation
   - The documentation doesn't suggest using vertex_to_simplex instead of find_simplex for vertices

CONCLUSION:
The documentation does not explicitly state that vertices should always be findable, but this is a reasonable expectation based on:
1. Mathematical properties of triangulations
2. The existence of vertex_to_simplex suggesting this is a valid query
3. The fact that -1 means "outside the triangulation" but vertices are definitionally part of it
