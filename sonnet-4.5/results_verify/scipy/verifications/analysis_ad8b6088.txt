## Bug Triage Analysis

### Evaluation Against Each Category

#### 1. BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- Shape preservation is violated for mono audio, creating an inconsistency
- All other channel counts preserve shape correctly (2, 3, 4+ channels)
- User expectation of round-trip fidelity is violated
- Creates special-case handling requirements in user code

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The behavior is exactly as documented
- read() explicitly states it returns 1-D for mono
- This is an intentional design choice, not an oversight
- The WAV format itself doesn't distinguish between (N,) and (N, 1)

#### 2. INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The documentation is explicit: read() returns "1-D for 1-channel WAV"
- The test assumes round-trip behavior that was never promised
- The functions work exactly as specified
- Round-trip shape preservation is not documented as a requirement

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- There is a genuine inconsistency in the API
- Users have reasonable expectations about round-trip operations
- The inconsistency only affects mono, not other channel counts

#### 3. WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- This is a minor edge case that's easy to work around
- Users can simply reshape after reading if needed
- Changing this would break backward compatibility
- The current behavior simplifies the common mono case

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This causes real confusion and requires special handling
- The fix would be straightforward
- It's not an obscure edge case - mono audio is very common

#### 4. FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- Round-trip shape preservation was never a promised feature
- This would be adding new functionality (shape preservation)
- Could add an optional parameter to preserve shape

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- This seems more like fixing an inconsistency than adding a feature
- Other channel counts already have this "feature"

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation could be clearer about this asymmetry
- Could add explicit warning about shape changes for mono
- Could provide examples showing the shape transformation

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The documentation is already accurate and explicit
- read() clearly states it returns 1-D for mono

### Analysis Summary

This is a borderline case between INVALID and DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The key factors:

1. **The behavior is documented**: read() explicitly says it returns 1-D for mono
2. **The test assumes undocumented behavior**: Round-trip shape preservation is never promised
3. **WAV format limitation**: WAV files don't preserve NumPy array shapes
4. **Design intent**: This appears to be an intentional simplification for mono audio

The bug report makes incorrect assumptions about expected behavior. While the inconsistency is real and could be confusing, it's not a deviation from documented behavior. The functions work exactly as specified in their documentation.

### Recommendation

This should be categorized as **INVALID** because:
1. The behavior matches the documentation exactly
2. The test assumes round-trip properties that were never specified
3. The "bug" is based on user expectation rather than documented behavior
4. The WAV format itself doesn't support preserving NumPy array shapes

While a case could be made for DOCUMENTATION_FIX to add warnings about this behavior, the current documentation is technically correct and complete. The read() function explicitly states it returns 1-D for mono, which is exactly what it does.
