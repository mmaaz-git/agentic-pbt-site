TRIAGE ANALYSIS FOR scipy.signal.resample EMPTY ARRAY BUG
==========================================================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function's core purpose is to resample a signal using Fourier methods, and an empty signal has no frequency components to analyze. The mathematical operation of computing an FFT on empty data is inherently undefined. The documentation never claims to support empty arrays, and the function requires actual data points to perform frequency domain analysis. The error is technically correct - you cannot compute an FFT with 0 data points.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The error occurs deep in the implementation rather than being caught with proper input validation. Other scipy.signal functions handle empty arrays more gracefully (resample_poly returns empty, fftconvolve returns empty). The error message is cryptic and doesn't help users understand what went wrong at the API level.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Empty array inputs represent an extreme edge case that would never occur in real signal processing workflows. Scientists and engineers using resample are working with actual signal data, not empty arrays. The mathematical operation is undefined, so any behavior would be arbitrary. The cost of adding special case handling may not be worth it for such an obscure scenario that indicates a programming error upstream.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The inconsistent handling across scipy.signal functions suggests this is a broader issue worth addressing. The error message is unhelpful and occurs deep in the stack. A simple check at the function entry would provide better user experience. Other functions in the same module handle this case, setting a precedent.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't specify what happens with empty arrays, leaving the behavior undefined. Adding a note that the function requires non-empty input would clarify expectations. The current behavior (raising an error) is reasonable but undocumented. This would align documentation with actual behavior without changing code.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting the current cryptic error doesn't improve user experience. The error comes from deep within FFT, not from resample's documented interface. Other scipy.signal functions don't document empty array behavior either, yet some handle it gracefully. The issue is more about code quality than documentation gaps.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting empty arrays would be a new capability not currently implemented. The user is essentially asking for the function to handle an edge case it wasn't designed for. Returning zeros or an empty array would be adding new functionality. This would require new code to detect and handle the special case.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't about adding new functionality but about handling invalid input gracefully. The function already has a defined purpose that doesn't include empty arrays. Basic input validation isn't a feature, it's a robustness concern. Other functions already handle this, suggesting it's expected behavior rather than a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function crashes with an unhelpful error message from deep within the implementation stack. Other scipy.signal functions handle empty arrays gracefully (resample_poly, fftconvolve, medfilt all return empty arrays). The lack of input validation causes a cryptic error that makes debugging difficult. The error message doesn't indicate the actual problem (empty input) but talks about FFT internals.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function behaves correctly by rejecting mathematically undefined operations. FFT cannot operate on empty data, so the error is appropriate. The documentation never claims to support empty arrays. The operation of resampling empty data is nonsensical in signal processing context. The error correctly prevents undefined behavior.

## Overall Consideration

This case highlights a classic tension in library design between mathematical correctness and user experience. The resample function uses FFT internally, and FFT mathematically requires non-empty data. From a pure mathematical standpoint, the operation is undefined and the error is appropriate.

However, the error handling is poor from a software engineering perspective. The error occurs deep in the FFT implementation with a message that doesn't clearly indicate the root cause (empty input array). Other functions in the same module (resample_poly, fftconvolve) handle empty arrays gracefully by returning empty arrays, establishing a precedent for consistent behavior.

The key issue is not whether the function should "work" with empty arrays (the operation is mathematically undefined), but whether it should fail gracefully with clear error messages at the API boundary rather than deep in the implementation. Given that scipy is a scientific library where mathematical correctness is paramount, and that empty array inputs represent programmer error rather than valid use cases, this is likely an edge case that doesn't merit the complexity of special handling. The error is technically correct, even if the message could be clearer. This falls into the category of "would be nice to have better error messages" rather than "the function is broken."
