## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG

**Arguments FOR categorizing as BUG:**
1. The function crashes with a cryptic error (LinAlgError: Singular matrix) when given a seemingly valid input (step_factor=1.0)
2. The input validation accepts step_factor=1.0 as valid (only checks >= 0 and not NaN)
3. The documentation does not indicate that step_factor=1.0 is invalid
4. Users have no way to know from documentation or error messages that this value causes problems
5. The error occurs deep in the linear algebra code rather than at input validation
6. The function should either handle this case or provide clear error messaging

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- None. This is clearly a bug where valid-seeming input causes an unexpected crash.

### Consideration for INVALID

**Arguments FOR categorizing as INVALID:**
- One could argue that step_factor=1.0 mathematically doesn't make sense for the algorithm
- The algorithm inherently requires varying step sizes to work

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't specify this constraint
- The input validation accepts the value
- Users cannot reasonably be expected to understand the internal algorithm requirements
- The function should validate its inputs properly

### Consideration for WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR categorizing as WONTFIX:**
- step_factor=1.0 is an edge case that might rarely be used in practice
- Most users would use the default value of 2.0

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The fix is straightforward (add validation)
- The crash is severe and unhelpful
- It's a valid edge case that should be handled gracefully
- The suggested fix in the bug report is minimal and improves user experience

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR categorizing as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The code technically works as designed (the algorithm requires step_factor != 1.0)
- One could update documentation to specify that step_factor must not equal 1.0

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The code crashes rather than providing a useful error
- Input validation should catch invalid inputs, not rely on documentation alone
- The current behavior violates the principle of fail-fast with clear errors
- Users get a cryptic LinAlgError from deep in NumPy rather than a clear ValueError

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR categorizing as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could view "handling step_factor=1.0" as a new feature
- The algorithm wasn't designed to handle constant step sizes

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not requesting new functionality
- The issue is that existing functionality crashes unexpectedly
- Proper error handling is not a feature, it's a bug fix

### Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG** because:

1. **Valid-seeming input causes a crash**: step_factor=1.0 passes all input validation but causes a LinAlgError
2. **Documentation gap**: Nothing in the documentation indicates this value is invalid
3. **Poor error messaging**: Users get a cryptic "Singular matrix" error instead of a clear message about the parameter constraint
4. **Easy to trigger**: Any user exploring the parameter space could easily hit this
5. **Clear fix available**: The bug report provides a simple fix that adds proper validation

The principle here is that functions should validate their inputs and provide clear error messages when constraints are violated. A cryptic LinAlgError from deep in the linear algebra code is not acceptable user experience for an invalid parameter value.
