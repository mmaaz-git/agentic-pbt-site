DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Official Documentation Review

### scipy.stats.binom Documentation
The official SciPy documentation for scipy.stats.binom states:
- Parameter p must be in the range [0, 1], inclusive
- No explicit warnings about numerical overflow or precision issues with extreme values
- No documented limitations for very small probability values
- The PMF is defined mathematically as: f(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

### Key Documentation Gaps
1. **No overflow warnings**: The documentation does not mention that extreme values of p near machine epsilon may cause OverflowError
2. **No numerical limits specified**: While p ∈ [0,1] is stated, there's no warning about practical numerical limits
3. **No alternative recommendations**: Documentation doesn't suggest using logpmf or other methods for extreme parameters

## Community Knowledge

Based on Stack Overflow and GitHub issues:
- This is a known issue in the SciPy community
- Similar overflow problems have been reported with extreme parameters
- The underlying cause is the Boost Math library's ibeta_derivative function
- Workarounds exist (Poisson approximation, logpmf, higher precision arithmetic)

## Mathematical Validity

The binomial PMF is mathematically well-defined for all:
- n ≥ 0 (integer)
- 0 ≤ p ≤ 1
- k ∈ {0, 1, ..., n}

For the failing case (n=3, p=1.1125369292536007e-308, k=0):
- The input is mathematically valid
- The expected result P(X=0) = (1-p)^3 ≈ 1.0 is well-defined
- No mathematical reason for the calculation to fail

## API Contract Analysis

The function's implicit contract based on documentation:
1. **Accepts**: Any p in [0, 1] as a float
2. **Returns**: The probability mass at k
3. **No documented exceptions**: The documentation doesn't mention OverflowError as a possibility

The actual behavior violates this contract by:
- Raising an undocumented OverflowError for valid inputs
- Failing to compute a mathematically well-defined result

## Conclusion

The documentation establishes that:
1. The input values are within the specified valid range
2. The calculation should be possible according to the mathematical definition
3. No overflow exceptions are documented as expected behavior
4. The function fails to meet its documented specification for these inputs
