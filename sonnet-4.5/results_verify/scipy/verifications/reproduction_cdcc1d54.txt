Bug Reproduction Analysis
==========================

1. REPRODUCTION RESULTS:

I successfully reproduced the exact bug as described in the report:
- When calling set_iprint(init=0, so_init=1) with a rptfile specified, the code crashes with: "ValueError: [0, 1] is not in list"
- When calling set_iprint(init=0, so_init=2) with a rptfile specified, the code crashes with: "ValueError: [0, 2] is not in list"

2. TESTING MATRIX:

Tested combinations with rptfile='test.txt':
- init=0, so_init=0: ✓ Works (no output anywhere)
- init=1, so_init=0: ✓ Works (short to file only)
- init=2, so_init=0: ✓ Works (long to file only)
- init=0, so_init=1: ✗ ValueError: [0, 1] is not in list
- init=0, so_init=2: ✗ ValueError: [0, 2] is not in list
- init=1, so_init=1: ✓ Works (short to both)
- init=2, so_init=2: ✓ Works (long to both)

3. ERROR BEHAVIOR:

The error occurs exactly as described:
- Line 1079 in _odrpack.py attempts: ip[0] = ip2arg.index(iprint_l[0:2])
- The combination [0, 1] is not in the ip2arg list
- This causes a generic Python ValueError rather than a meaningful error message

4. EXISTING ERROR HANDLING:

There IS error handling for the reverse case (lines 1053-1058):
- When rptfile is None and so_* arguments are provided, it raises a clear OdrError: "no rptfile specified, cannot output to stdout twice"
- This error correctly fired when I tested with no rptfile and so_init=1

5. DESIGN INTENT vs IMPLEMENTATION:

The code clearly intends to prohibit printing to stdout without file when rptfile is specified. The ip2arg lookup table deliberately excludes [0,1] and [0,2] combinations. However:
- The error handling for this constraint is incomplete
- The code crashes with an unhelpful ValueError instead of raising a meaningful OdrError
- The existing check (lines 1053-1058) only catches the case when rptfile is None, not when rptfile exists but init=0

TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
The bug report is technically accurate - the code does crash with a ValueError when these parameter combinations are used. The hypothesis test correctly identifies the failing inputs.
