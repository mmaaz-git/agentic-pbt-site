## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation for scipy.integrate.simpson does not specify that the function must satisfy the mathematical reversal property. Unlike trapezoid (which explicitly documents this behavior), simpson's documentation is silent on what should happen with reversed arrays. Since this behavior is unspecified, expecting it to work a certain way could be considered invalid. The implementation uses the Cartwright correction for even numbers of points, which is a legitimate numerical method that happens to be asymmetric. The function is working as implemented, and there's no documentation promising reversal symmetry.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The reversal property (∫_a^b f(x)dx = -∫_b^a f(x)dx) is a fundamental mathematical property of integration that users would reasonably expect any numerical integration method to satisfy. This is not an obscure edge case but a basic mathematical principle taught in calculus. The fact that trapezoid explicitly implements this correctly suggests it's an expected behavior for integration functions. The inconsistency between trapezoid and simpson in the same module is problematic.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The Cartwright correction formula used for even numbers of points is mathematically sound and published in peer-reviewed literature. Changing it to satisfy the reversal property might reduce the accuracy of the integration for the intended use case (forward integration). The asymmetry only affects even numbers of points, and users can work around it by ensuring odd numbers of points or by being aware of the limitation. The issue might be considered too niche to warrant changing established numerical methods.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial edge case - it affects a fundamental mathematical property that many scientific applications rely on. The bug can lead to incorrect results in real applications that depend on the reversal property. Other integration methods (like trapezoid) handle this correctly, so it's clearly possible to implement. The issue affects a common scenario (even number of data points) and produces significantly wrong results (25% error in the example).

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't mention the reversal property at all, while trapezoid's documentation explicitly shows an example of it. Adding a note about this limitation for even numbers of points would help users understand the behavior. The Cartwright correction is a legitimate numerical method, but its asymmetric nature should be documented. Users need to know that simpson with even points doesn't satisfy the reversal property so they can make informed choices.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
This goes beyond a documentation issue - it's a fundamental mathematical property that's violated. Simply documenting that "simpson doesn't work correctly for reversed arrays" would be acknowledging a significant defect rather than clarifying expected behavior. The mathematical incorrectness suggests this is a bug in the implementation, not just a documentation gap. Users would reasonably expect mathematical properties to hold without needing explicit documentation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Adding support for the reversal property while maintaining the Cartwright correction could be seen as a new feature. One could argue for a new parameter like `symmetric=True` that ensures reversal property at the potential cost of accuracy. The current implementation works for forward integration, and adding reversal support is an enhancement. This would be adding new functionality rather than fixing broken functionality.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The reversal property is not a "feature" - it's a fundamental mathematical requirement for integration. This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new capabilities. Other integration functions already handle this correctly, so it's not a new concept for the library. The current behavior produces mathematically incorrect results, which is a bug, not a missing feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function violates a fundamental mathematical property of integration. The reversal property is not an obscure requirement but a basic principle that all integration methods should satisfy. The inconsistency with trapezoid (which handles reversal correctly) suggests this is unintended behavior. The error is significant (25% in the example) and systematic, affecting all even-point integrations. Real scientific applications that depend on this property would get incorrect results. The scipy tests don't verify this property, suggesting it may have been overlooked rather than intentionally violated.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The documentation never promises that the reversal property will be satisfied. The Cartwright correction is a published, peer-reviewed method that happens to be asymmetric. The implementation correctly follows the mathematical formula from the referenced paper. The function is working exactly as coded, following established numerical methods. The behavior could be considered a known limitation of the Cartwright correction rather than a bug. Since the documentation doesn't specify this behavior, the implementation isn't technically wrong.

## Overall consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a challenging case that sits between DOCUMENTATION_FIX and BUG. The key factors to consider are:

First, the reversal property of integration is indeed a fundamental mathematical principle. When we reverse the limits of integration, we expect the sign to flip but the magnitude to remain the same. This is not an obscure property but something taught in basic calculus and relied upon in many applications. The fact that scipy.integrate.trapezoid explicitly implements and documents this property correctly shows that it's an expected behavior within the scipy ecosystem.

Second, the technical implementation using the Cartwright correction is mathematically sound for forward integration, but its asymmetric nature causes the reversal property violation. The issue only affects even numbers of points - odd numbers work correctly. This suggests the problem is specifically with how the Cartwright correction handles the last interval for even-point datasets. While the Cartwright formula is legitimate, its application here leads to mathematically inconsistent results when considering the fundamental properties of integration.

Third, the lack of documentation about this behavior is significant. While simpson's documentation doesn't explicitly promise the reversal property, it also doesn't warn users that this fundamental property is violated for even-point datasets. In contrast, trapezoid's documentation explicitly demonstrates the reversal property with an example. This inconsistency within the same module suggests that the reversal property should be expected to work. However, since the documentation never explicitly states that simpson satisfies this property, and given that the implementation follows a published numerical method (albeit one that breaks mathematical consistency), this leans toward being a documentation issue rather than a clear bug. The documentation should warn users about this limitation, especially given how it differs from other integration methods in the same module.
