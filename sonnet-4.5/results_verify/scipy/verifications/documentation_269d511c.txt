## Documentation Analysis for scipy.io.matlab.savemat

### Key Findings:

1. **Internal Documentation (_mio.py lines 271-273):**
   The docstring for the `savemat` function in the scipy source code explicitly states:

   "Note that if this dict has a key starting with `_` or a sub-dict has a key starting with `_` or a digit, these key's items will not be saved in the mat file and `MatWriteWarning` will be issued."

2. **Online SciPy Documentation:**
   The official scipy documentation webpage confirms the same behavior - keys starting with underscore (`_`) or digits should not be saved and should generate warnings.

3. **Implementation Review:**
   - In `_mio5.py` (lines 884-888): Only checks for underscore prefix (`if name[0] == '_'`), issues warning and skips saving
   - In `_mio4.py` (lines 631-632): No validation at all - directly saves all variables without checking names

### Documentation vs Implementation Discrepancy:

The documentation clearly states that variable names starting with BOTH underscores AND digits should be:
1. Not saved to the mat file
2. Trigger a MatWriteWarning

However, the current implementation:
- For format='5' (default): Only validates and rejects underscore-prefixed names
- For format='4': Does no validation at all

This represents a clear mismatch between what the documentation promises and what the code actually does. The documentation sets an expectation that digit-prefixed variable names will be filtered out with a warning, but this is not implemented.
