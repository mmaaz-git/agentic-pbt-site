## Documentation Analysis for scipy.constants.convert_temperature

### Official Documentation
The official SciPy documentation for `convert_temperature` function states:
- The function converts temperature values between Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Rankine scales
- Parameters are val (temperature value(s)), old_scale, and new_scale
- Returns converted temperature value(s) as float or array of floats
- Example shows converting -40 and 40 degrees Celsius to Kelvin

### What the Documentation DOES NOT State
Critically, the documentation:
1. Does NOT mention any validation for physically impossible temperatures
2. Does NOT state that negative Kelvin or negative Rankine values are invalid
3. Does NOT specify that the function enforces physical constraints
4. Does NOT mention that absolute zero is a lower bound for temperature
5. Does NOT indicate whether this is a pure mathematical conversion or a physics-aware conversion

### Source Code Analysis
Examining the actual implementation shows:
- The function performs purely mathematical conversions between scales
- No validation is performed on input values
- The conversion is a two-step process: first convert to Kelvin, then to the target scale
- For Kelvin input, the value is passed through unchanged (tempo = _val)
- For Rankine input, it's converted with tempo = _val * 5 / 9
- There are no checks for negative values or physical impossibilities

### Key Observation
The function appears to be designed as a mathematical temperature scale converter, not a physics-aware temperature validator. The documentation example even includes -40Â°C, which while physically valid, suggests the function handles negative values without concern for physical validity in absolute scales.

The function name "convert_temperature" and its placement in scipy.constants (not scipy.physics or similar) suggests it's meant to be a utility for mathematical conversion between temperature scales, not a physics simulation tool that enforces thermodynamic constraints.
