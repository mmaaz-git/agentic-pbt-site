## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments against:**
- The inputs meet all documented requirements (strictly increasing times, valid rotations)
- The documentation provides no warning about time spacing limitations
- The error occurs due to internal numerical instability, not user error
- Real-world use cases legitimately produce such time arrays
**Conclusion:** This is NOT an invalid bug report.

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments for:**
- Could be considered an edge case with extreme time ratios (512:1)
- Numerical stability issues in matrix solvers are inherently difficult
**Arguments against:**
- The failing time ratios (500:1) are not unreasonable for real applications
- Adaptive sampling and variable-rate sensors naturally produce such data
- The error message is cryptic and misleading
- The crash happens with legitimate scientific data
**Conclusion:** The impact is significant enough that this should not be WONTFIX.

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for:**
- Supporting extreme time ratios could be seen as a new capability
- Numerical robustness improvements could be considered enhancements
**Arguments against:**
- The function already claims to support arbitrary time arrays
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality
- The API contract implies this should already work
**Conclusion:** This is a bug in existing functionality, not a request for new features.

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for:**
- The documentation could be updated to warn about time spacing limitations
- Could add notes about numerical stability requirements
**Arguments against:**
- The code is genuinely broken for valid inputs
- Documenting limitations would be a workaround, not a fix
- Users expect the function to handle these inputs correctly
- The proper solution is to fix the numerical instability
**Conclusion:** While documentation could be improved, the core issue is a code bug.

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments for:**
- Valid inputs according to documentation cause crashes
- The error message is misleading (blames user input for internal NaNs)
- Real-world use cases are affected
- The numerical instability is a implementation defect
- Other spline implementations handle similar cases correctly
- The bug report provides clear reproduction and suggests reasonable fixes
**Arguments against:**
- None substantial

### Final Assessment

This is a clear BUG for the following reasons:

1. **Contract violation**: The implementation fails to handle inputs that satisfy all documented requirements

2. **Real impact**: Variable time sampling is common in scientific applications (sensors, adaptive algorithms)

3. **Poor error handling**: The error message incorrectly suggests the user provided NaN/Inf values

4. **Fixable issue**: The bug report suggests practical solutions (input validation, normalization, better conditioning)

5. **Expected behavior**: Users reasonably expect any strictly increasing time array to work

The implementation has a numerical stability defect that causes it to fail on legitimate inputs. This should be fixed either by improving the numerical methods or by adding clear input validation with helpful error messages.
