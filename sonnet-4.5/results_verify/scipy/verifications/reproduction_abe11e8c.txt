REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. PROPERTY-BASED TEST RESULTS:
   - The hypothesis test fails as described when given size-1 arrays
   - Specific failing example: array([0.], dtype=float16)
   - Error received: RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested
   - The error message is indeed confusing because the input has length 1, not 0

2. SIMPLE TEST CASE REPRODUCTION:
   - Tested scipy.fft.dct(np.array([42.0]), type=1)
   - Confirmed RuntimeError with message: "zero-length FFT requested"
   - The error message matches exactly what the bug report claims

3. COMPARISON WITH OTHER DCT TYPES:
   - DCT Type 2 with size-1 array: Works correctly, returns [2.]
   - DCT Type 3 with size-1 array: Works correctly, returns [1.]
   - DCT Type 4 with size-1 array: Works correctly, returns [1.41421356]
   - This confirms the inconsistency mentioned in the bug report

4. NATURE OF THE ERROR:
   The error message "zero-length FFT requested" is misleading because:
   - The input array has length 1, not length 0
   - The actual problem is a mathematical constraint (division by N-1)
   - Users would naturally check their input size and be confused when it's non-zero

CONCLUSION:
The bug is reproducible exactly as described. The error message is indeed confusing and misleading, as it suggests the input is zero-length when it's actually length 1. The real issue is that DCT Type I is mathematically undefined for N=1.
