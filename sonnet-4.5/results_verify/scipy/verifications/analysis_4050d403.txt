BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===================

Analyzing the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. CONSIDERATION FOR "BUG" (VALID BUG REPORT)

   Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:
   - Clear API contract violation: Documentation states iterations should contain
     "number of iterations performed" but it contains uninitialized memory
   - Reproducible issue with concrete test case and property-based test
   - Returns garbage values (e.g., -346829376) instead of valid iteration counts
   - Affects core functionality - users cannot reliably get iteration count
   - Not an edge case - occurs whenever root is at boundary (common scenario)
   - Security/reliability concern: exposing uninitialized memory to users
   - The fix is straightforward: initialize the struct field properly

   This appears to be a classic uninitialized memory bug in C code.

2. CONSIDERATION FOR "INVALID"

   Arguments AGAINST classifying as INVALID:
   - The documentation clearly specifies iterations should be a valid count
   - The bug is real and reproducible, not based on misunderstanding
   - The test expectations are reasonable (iterations >= 0 for success)
   - Not a case of undefined behavior - the API contract is explicit
   - Not about exception types or error messages

   This is clearly NOT an invalid report.

3. CONSIDERATION FOR "WONTFIX"

   Arguments AGAINST classifying as WONTFIX:
   - This is not an obscure edge case - boundary roots are common
   - The issue affects public API, not internal functions
   - Uninitialized memory is a serious issue, not trivial
   - Users have legitimate need for iteration counts
   - The garbage values could cause crashes in user code
   - Security implications of exposing uninitialized memory

   This is too serious to classify as WONTFIX.

4. CONSIDERATION FOR "DOCUMENTATION_FIX"

   Arguments AGAINST classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
   - The documentation correctly describes expected behavior
   - The code is wrong, not the documentation
   - Changing docs to say "iterations might be garbage" would be wrong
   - The documented behavior is the sensible/expected behavior

   This is not a documentation issue.

5. CONSIDERATION FOR "FEATURE_REQUEST"

   Arguments AGAINST classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:
   - The functionality already exists and is documented
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new features
   - The API already promises to return iteration counts
   - Users aren't asking for something new, but for existing feature to work

   This is not a feature request.

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- Medium to High severity
- Exposes uninitialized memory (potential security issue)
- Breaks documented API contract
- Affects common use case (boundary roots)
- Could cause crashes or incorrect behavior in user code

ROOT CAUSE:
The C implementation has an early return path when f(xa) or f(xb) is within tolerance
of zero, and this path fails to initialize the iterations field of the output struct
before returning. This is a classic C programming error.

RECOMMENDATION:
This should be classified as a BUG and fixed. The fix is straightforward - ensure
the iterations field is initialized in all code paths, particularly the early
return paths when a root is found at a boundary.
