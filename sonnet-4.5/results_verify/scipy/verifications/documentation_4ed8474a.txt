## Documentation Analysis for scipy.fftpack.hilbert and ihilbert

### Official Documentation States

From the scipy.fftpack.hilbert documentation:

1. **Round-trip Property**: "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x"
   - This is stated as an unconditional rule when sum equals zero
   - No mention of any restriction based on array length parity

2. **Nyquist Mode Handling**: "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero"
   - This is mentioned as a separate note
   - The documentation does NOT connect this to the round-trip property
   - It does not warn that this affects the round-trip guarantee

### Critical Documentation Gap

The documentation presents these two facts:
1. A round-trip guarantee when sum(x) == 0
2. Special handling for even-length arrays (Nyquist mode set to zero)

However, it fails to mention that these two aspects are incompatible. The special Nyquist handling for even-length arrays directly causes the round-trip property to fail, even when sum(x) == 0.

### Mathematical Background

The Hilbert transform operates on Fourier coefficients:
- hilbert: y_j = sqrt(-1) * sign(j) * x_j, y_0 = 0
- ihilbert: y_j = -sqrt(-1) * sign(j) * x_j, y_0 = 0

For even-length arrays, there is a Nyquist frequency component at index N/2. Setting this to zero loses information, making perfect reconstruction impossible.

### Documentation Verdict

The documentation is incorrect or at minimum misleading. It promises a round-trip property "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0" without any caveat about array length, while simultaneously noting that even-length arrays have special handling that makes this promise impossible to keep.

The documentation should either:
1. Clarify that the round-trip property only holds for odd-length arrays
2. Explain why the Nyquist mode handling breaks the round-trip for even-length arrays
3. Or both

This is a clear case where the documentation makes a promise that the implementation cannot fulfill due to its design choices around Nyquist frequency handling.
