## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation Review

I reviewed the official SciPy documentation for RotationSpline and found the following:

#### Documented Requirements
1. **times**: array_like, shape (N,)
   - "At least 2 times must be specified"
   - No other restrictions mentioned

2. **rotations**: Rotation instance
   - "Must contain N rotations"

3. **Implicit requirement** (from error checking):
   - Times must be in strictly increasing order

#### What the Documentation DOES NOT Specify

The documentation makes NO mention of:
- Restrictions on time spacing between points
- Maximum or minimum allowed time deltas
- Ratio limits between consecutive time intervals
- Numerical stability considerations for extreme time variations
- Any warnings about non-uniform time sampling

#### Example in Documentation

The example uses evenly-spaced times: [0, 10, 20, 40]
- These have moderate, relatively uniform spacing
- No examples show extreme variations in time spacing

#### Mathematical Reference

The documentation references a paper on "Smooth Attitude Interpolation" for implementation details. However:
- This reference is external and not part of the API contract
- Users cannot be expected to read academic papers to understand API limitations
- The paper likely discusses numerical stability, but this isn't surfaced in the user-facing documentation

### Key Finding

The documentation establishes clear expectations:
1. Any strictly increasing time array should work
2. No documented restrictions on spacing exist
3. Real-world use cases (mentioned in bug report) like adaptive sampling and variable-rate sensors naturally produce non-uniform time arrays

The current behavior violates the documented API contract by failing on inputs that meet all documented requirements. Users have no way to know that certain valid time arrays will cause crashes.
