## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue is confirmed:

### Reproduction Results:

1. **Direct test with reported failing input (M=2, alpha=2.225e-311)**:
   - Result: [ 0. nan]
   - Confirmed: NaN value produced in the output

2. **Manual test cases from bug report**:
   - tukey(2, alpha=1e-308) = [ 0. nan]
   - tukey(5, alpha=1e-308) = [ 0.  1.  1.  1. nan]
   - tukey(10, alpha=1e-308) = [ 0.  1.  1.  1.  1.  1.  1.  1.  1. nan]

### Warnings observed:
The function produces two runtime warnings:
1. "overflow encountered in divide" - Confirming that 2.0/alpha overflows to infinity
2. "invalid value encountered in add" - Confirming that the NaN propagates through the calculation

### Pattern observed:
- The NaN consistently appears in the last element of the returned array
- The rest of the values are either 0 or 1 (as expected for a Tukey window)
- The issue occurs when alpha < ~1e-307, exactly as reported

### Root cause confirmed:
The warnings and line number (946) confirm the bug report's analysis:
```python
w3 = 0.5 * (1 + xp.cos(xp.pi * (-2.0/alpha + 1 + 2.0*n3/alpha/(M-1))))
```
When alpha is extremely small:
1. 2.0/alpha overflows to infinity
2. cos(infinity) evaluates to NaN
3. This NaN propagates to the final output

The bug is real and reproducible exactly as described in the report.
