Bug Triage Analysis
===================

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

INVALID (Bug report is incorrect):
-----------------------------------
Arguments against:
- The documentation DOES state that DCT type 1 requires size > 1
- DCT-I is mathematically undefined for N < 2 according to Wikipedia
- The limitation is expected based on the mathematical definition

Arguments for:
- The error message "zero-length FFT requested" is factually wrong (array has length 1, not 0)
- DST type 1 has identical documentation but works fine with single elements
- The inconsistency between DCT and DST behavior despite identical limitations is problematic

WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting):
---------------------------------
Arguments against:
- Property-based testing is a legitimate use case
- The misleading error message causes confusion
- Single-element transforms are edge cases that should be handled consistently

Arguments for:
- Single-element DCT-I is a rare edge case
- The limitation is documented
- Users can check array size before calling

FEATURE_REQUEST (Not currently supported):
-------------------------------------------
Arguments against:
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The issue is about error handling and consistency
- DCT-I mathematically cannot support N=1

Arguments for:
- Could be seen as requesting better error handling
- Requesting consistency with DST type 1 behavior

DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong):
--------------------------------------------
Arguments against:
- The documentation correctly states the limitation
- The mathematical basis is sound

Arguments for:
- DST documentation says the same thing but DST works
- The error behavior should be documented more clearly
- The documentation doesn't explain why DCT fails but DST works

BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed):
--------------------------------------
Arguments for:
- The error message is completely wrong ("zero-length FFT" for length-1 input)
- Inconsistent behavior: DST type 1 works despite identical documentation
- Poor user experience with misleading errors
- The code should either:
  a) Provide a clear, accurate error message, OR
  b) Handle single elements like DST does

Arguments against:
- The limitation is documented
- DCT-I is mathematically undefined for N < 2

Final Assessment:
-----------------
This is a BUG for the following reasons:

1. PRIMARY ISSUE - Misleading Error: The error message "zero-length FFT requested" is factually incorrect and misleading. The array has length 1, not 0. This is a clear bug in error reporting.

2. SECONDARY ISSUE - Inconsistency: DST type 1 has identical documentation claiming it requires size > 1, yet it successfully handles single-element arrays. This inconsistency in behavior despite identical documentation requirements is problematic.

3. The bug report correctly identifies both issues and proposes reasonable fixes:
   - Better error message (minimum requirement)
   - Consistent behavior with DST (nice to have)

While the DCT-I limitation for N < 2 is mathematically justified and documented, the implementation's error handling is objectively wrong and needs fixing. At minimum, the error message should accurately reflect the actual problem.
