## Documentation Analysis

### scipy.io.savemat Documentation

The official scipy.io.savemat documentation states:
- Keys starting with underscore (_) will NOT be saved and will issue a MatWriteWarning
- Keys starting with a digit will NOT be saved and will issue a MatWriteWarning
- No explicit mention of Unicode or non-ASCII character restrictions for variable names
- The documentation does not specify what character encoding is supported for variable names

### MATLAB Variable Name Requirements

According to official MATLAB documentation:
1. Variable names must start with a letter
2. Can be followed by letters, digits, or underscores
3. "Letters" in MATLAB context traditionally means ASCII letters (A-Z, a-z)

Additional research confirms:
- MATLAB does NOT support Unicode variable names
- MATLAB's identifier namespace is identical to C's identifier namespace
- Only US-ASCII characters are allowed in MATLAB variable names
- Unicode is supported in MATLAB strings and comments, but NOT in variable names
- MathWorks has acknowledged this limitation but has no timeline for Unicode variable name support

### Documentation Gap

There is a clear documentation gap in scipy.io.savemat:
1. The function documentation does not mention that variable names must be ASCII-only
2. The function accepts dictionary keys with any Unicode characters
3. The function internally uses latin-1 encoding (which supports 256 characters, more than ASCII's 128)
4. However, MATLAB itself only supports ASCII variable names

### Expected Behavior

Based on MATLAB's restrictions, scipy.io.savemat should:
1. Either document that variable names must be ASCII-only
2. Or validate variable names and provide a clear error message when non-ASCII names are provided
3. The current behavior of crashing with a low-level UnicodeEncodeError is not documented

### Conclusion

The documentation is incomplete. It does not specify the character encoding requirements for variable names, leading to unexpected crashes when users provide valid Python dictionary keys that are invalid MATLAB variable names.
