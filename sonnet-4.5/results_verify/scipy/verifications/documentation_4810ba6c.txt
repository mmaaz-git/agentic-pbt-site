## Documentation Analysis

### Official Documentation

The function's docstring clearly specifies the expected parameter types:

```
Parameters
----------
datasets : callable or list/tuple of callable or None
```

This documentation is unambiguous and states that the `datasets` parameter must be one of:
1. `None` (default) - clears all cached data files
2. A callable (e.g., scipy.datasets.ascent) - clears cache for that specific dataset
3. A list/tuple of callables - clears cache for multiple specific datasets

### Contract Clarity

The documentation is explicit about what constitutes valid input:
- "callable" - Must be a callable object (function/method)
- "list/tuple of callable" - Must be a collection containing only callables
- "None" - The specific None value

The documentation does NOT suggest that:
- Strings are acceptable
- Integers are acceptable
- Dictionaries are acceptable
- Any other non-callable types are acceptable

### Implementation vs Documentation

The implementation contains an `assert callable(dataset)` check on line 36, which confirms the documented contract. This assertion demonstrates that the developers intended to enforce the documented parameter types.

### Examples in Documentation

The provided example shows proper usage:
```python
datasets.clear_cache([datasets.ascent])
```
This passes a list containing a callable (datasets.ascent), which aligns with the documented contract.

### Conclusion

The documentation clearly defines the acceptable input types. Any deviation from accepting only None, callables, or lists/tuples of callables is a violation of the documented API contract. The current behavior of silently accepting invalid inputs when the cache directory doesn't exist directly contradicts the documented specification.
