BUG TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==================

## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation does not explicitly promise that cumulative integrals of non-negative functions will be monotonically non-decreasing. The function documentation focuses on the numerical method (Simpson's 1/3 rule) rather than mathematical properties. One could argue that if the documentation doesn't guarantee monotonicity, then violating it isn't a bug.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The monotonicity of cumulative integrals for non-negative functions is a fundamental mathematical property, not an implementation detail. Any function claiming to compute cumulative integrals must respect basic mathematical properties, even if not explicitly stated. This is like a sort function producing unsorted output - it's wrong even without explicit documentation.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The issue might be considered an inherent limitation of the specific Simpson's rule implementation from Cartwright's paper. The documentation already mentions that results differ from iterative Simpson integration, suggesting known quirks. For edge cases with sparse data (3 points), users could use cumulative_trapezoid instead.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not an obscure edge case but a violation of fundamental calculus. The bug occurs with simple, valid inputs and produces mathematically impossible results (negative integrals of non-negative functions). It affects the correctness of scientific computations and cannot be dismissed as unimportant.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be updated to warn users that the function may produce non-monotonic results for non-negative functions due to the specific implementation. Users could be advised to use cumulative_trapezoid when monotonicity is required. This treats it as expected behavior that needs documentation.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Documenting mathematically incorrect behavior doesn't make it acceptable. A cumulative integration function that violates fundamental calculus properties is broken, not just poorly documented. Users expect mathematical functions to be mathematically correct.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that monotonicity preservation is an additional feature that could be added. The current implementation follows Cartwright's paper exactly, and adding monotonicity constraints would be a new feature on top of the existing algorithm.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Mathematical correctness is not a feature but a requirement. Cumulative integration has a precise mathematical definition that includes monotonicity for non-negative functions. This isn't asking for something new but for the function to work correctly.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function produces mathematically impossible results: negative cumulative integrals for non-negative functions. This violates the fundamental theorem of calculus. The issue is reproducible, affects real use cases, and produces objectively incorrect output. Other integration functions (cumulative_trapezoid) handle these cases correctly, showing it's fixable.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The implementation appears to correctly follow the formulas from the referenced paper (Cartwright). If the paper's method has this limitation, it might be considered a known algorithmic characteristic rather than a bug.

## Overall Consideration

This issue represents a fundamental mathematical incorrectness in the cumulative_simpson function. When a non-negative function is integrated, the cumulative integral must be non-decreasing - this is not a preference or optimization but a mathematical requirement derived from the fundamental theorem of calculus.

The bug manifests clearly: for input [0, 0, 1], the function claims the integral from 0 to 1 is -0.0833, which is impossible since we're integrating a non-negative function. This isn't a numerical precision issue but a fundamental algorithmic problem where the implementation produces mathematically impossible results.

While the implementation may correctly follow Cartwright's paper, the resulting function fails to satisfy the basic mathematical properties of cumulative integration. This makes it unsuitable for scientific computing where mathematical correctness is essential. The fact that cumulative_trapezoid handles the same cases correctly demonstrates that proper behavior is achievable. This is clearly a bug that should be fixed to ensure the function produces mathematically valid results.
