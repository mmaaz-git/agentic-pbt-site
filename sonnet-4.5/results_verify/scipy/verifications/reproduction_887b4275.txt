Bug Reproduction Results
========================

Test Case 1: Basic Reproduction
--------------------------------
Input: signal = [1.0, 2.0], divisor = [0.0, 1.0]
Result: ValueError: BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet

The error occurs exactly as reported. The error message itself contains the word "BUG" and says "not supported yet", suggesting this is a known limitation that should be addressed.

Test Case 2: Hypothesis Test Input
-----------------------------------
Input: signal = [0.0, 0.0], divisor = [0.0, 1.0]
Result: Same ValueError: BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet

The hypothesis test's failing input produces the same error, confirming the issue.

Comparison with numpy.polydiv
------------------------------
When testing the same inputs with numpy.polydiv:
- Input: [1.0, 2.0], [0.0, 1.0]
  Result: Quotient = [inf], Remainder = [nan, -inf] (with divide by zero warning)

- Input: [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]
  Result: Quotient = [nan], Remainder = [nan, nan] (with warnings)

numpy.polydiv doesn't crash but produces mathematically undefined results (inf/nan) because it tries to divide by the leading coefficient (0).

Mathematical Analysis
---------------------
When the leading zeros are stripped from the divisor:
- Original divisor: [0.0, 1.0]
- After stripping: [1.0]
- Result: Quotient = [1.0, 2.0], Remainder = [0.0]
- Verification: convolve([1.0], [1.0, 2.0]) + [0.0] = [1.0, 2.0] âœ“

This shows that the operation is mathematically valid and produces the correct result when the leading zero is properly handled.

Hypothesis Test Behavior
------------------------
The hypothesis test would fail on any input where the divisor has a leading zero, even though such inputs satisfy the test's precondition that "any(abs(d) > 1e-6 for d in divisor)" is true (the second element is 1.0).

Summary
-------
The bug is reproducible exactly as reported. The function crashes with a ValueError that explicitly says "BUG" in the error message, indicating the developers are aware this is a limitation. The operation is mathematically valid when the leading zeros are handled properly.
