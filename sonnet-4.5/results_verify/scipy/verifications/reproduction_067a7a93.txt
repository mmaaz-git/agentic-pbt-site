# Reproduction Analysis

## Summary
The bug report has been successfully reproduced. The `scipy.differentiate.jacobian` function does indeed return the transpose of the expected Jacobian matrix.

## Test Results

### Property-Based Test
The property-based test using Hypothesis failed as expected, demonstrating that for any non-symmetric matrix A, when computing the Jacobian of f(x) = Ax, the function returns A.T instead of A. The test was run with matrices of dimensions 2x2 through 5x5, and in all cases:
- `res.df` was equal to A.T (transpose)
- `res.df` was NOT equal to A (the correct Jacobian)

### Simple Example Test
Using the specific test case with the upper triangular matrix:
```
A = [[1, 2, 3],
     [0, 4, 5],
     [0, 0, 6]]
```

The function returned:
```
res.df = [[1, 0, 0],
          [2, 4, 0],
          [3, 5, 6]]
```

This is exactly A.T (the transpose), when it should have returned A itself.

## Mathematical Verification
For a linear function f(x) = Ax:
- The i-th component is: f_i(x) = Σ_k A[i,k] * x[k]
- The partial derivative ∂f_i/∂x_j = A[i,j]
- Therefore, the Jacobian matrix J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j = A[i,j]

The function is returning J[j,i] instead of J[i,j], which is the definition of a transpose.

## Conclusion
The bug is real and reproducible. The `scipy.differentiate.jacobian` function consistently returns the transpose of the correct Jacobian matrix for linear functions, which is a fundamental mathematical error.
