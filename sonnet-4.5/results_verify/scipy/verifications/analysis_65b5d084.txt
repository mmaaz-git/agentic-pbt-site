## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The DateAttribute class and _get_date_format method are internal implementation details not documented in the public API. The official SciPy documentation explicitly states that date type attributes are "not implemented functionality." Since this is undocumented internal code, any behavior could be considered "unspecified" and therefore not a bug. Additionally, for most common date patterns, the function returns correct results despite the logic error.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The code contains an obvious programming error - `elif "yy":` instead of `elif "yy" in pattern:` - which is clearly unintentional. This is a basic Python syntax mistake where a string literal is used as a boolean condition. The bug produces demonstrably incorrect output for patterns like "date H", returning datetime_unit='Y' when no year component exists. This is objectively wrong behavior regardless of documentation status.

**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The bug only affects edge cases with single-character time patterns (H, m, s) which are unlikely to be used in practice. Most real-world date formats use double-character patterns (HH, mm, ss) which work correctly due to the overwrite behavior. The DateAttribute feature appears to be incomplete or experimental (given the documentation says it's not implemented), so fixing minor issues in unused code might not be worthwhile. The bug has likely existed for years without causing problems.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The bug represents incorrect logic that makes the code confusing and harder to maintain. Even if the impact is limited, having code that always evaluates to True when it shouldn't is a clear defect that should be fixed. The fix is trivial (adding "in pattern") and would improve code quality. Future developers might waste time understanding why this condition is always True.

**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The real issue might be that the DateAttribute class exists in the codebase but the documentation says date attributes are not supported. Perhaps the documentation needs updating to reflect that date support was actually added. The internal behavior of an undocumented feature doesn't need to be "correct" if it's not supposed to be used.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The bug report isn't about documentation - it's about incorrect code logic. The code contains `elif "yy":` which is objectively wrong Python syntax for checking substring membership. This isn't a documentation issue but a programming error. The documentation's claim that date attributes aren't supported might be outdated, but that doesn't change the fact that the code has a logic error.

**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Since date attributes are officially "not implemented" according to documentation, any work on this code could be considered adding new functionality rather than fixing bugs. Supporting single-character date patterns (H, m, s) correctly could be viewed as extending the feature to handle additional format variations that weren't originally intended.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The code already attempts to handle these patterns - it just does so incorrectly due to a programming error. This isn't requesting new functionality but fixing existing code that has a clear logic mistake. The elif statement was clearly intended to check if "yy" is in the pattern (matching the pattern of other conditions), not to always execute.

**Why it might be BUG:**
This is an unambiguous logic error in the code. The condition `elif "yy":` is always True because non-empty strings are truthy in Python. The correct syntax should be `elif "yy" in pattern:` to match the pattern of surrounding code. The bug causes incorrect output for valid input patterns like "date H", returning datetime_unit='Y' when the pattern contains no year component. This is demonstrably wrong behavior that violates the clear intent of the code.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The DateAttribute functionality is not officially supported according to SciPy documentation, making this more of an issue in experimental/internal code. The bug rarely manifests in practice since most real date formats use double-character patterns that trigger subsequent conditions that overwrite the incorrect value. Since users shouldn't be using this undocumented feature anyway, incorrect behavior in edge cases might not qualify as a reportable bug.

**Overall consideration**
This bug report identifies a genuine logic error in the SciPy codebase where `elif "yy":` should be `elif "yy" in pattern:`. The error is unambiguous - using a string literal as a boolean condition that always evaluates to True is clearly not the intended behavior. The bug produces objectively incorrect output for certain valid inputs (returning datetime_unit='Y' for patterns with no year component).

However, several factors complicate the triage decision. First, the DateAttribute class appears to be undocumented internal code, with official documentation stating date attributes are "not implemented." Second, the bug only manifests in edge cases with single-character time patterns that are unlikely to be used in practice. Third, for the vast majority of real-world date patterns, the bug is masked by subsequent code that overwrites the incorrect value.

The critical question is whether bugs in undocumented, officially "unsupported" internal code should be reported as bugs. While the code error itself is indisputable, if this feature isn't meant for public use, then incorrect behavior might not constitute a bug from the user's perspective. The most appropriate classification depends on whether we consider this from a code quality perspective (clear BUG) or a user impact perspective (possibly WONTFIX or INVALID due to being undocumented).
