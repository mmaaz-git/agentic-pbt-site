## Documentation Analysis

### scipy.io.savemat Documentation

The official docstring for `scipy.io.savemat` explicitly states:

"Note that if this dict has a key starting with `_` or a sub-dict has a key starting with `_` or a digit, these key's items will not be saved in the mat file and `MatWriteWarning` will be issued."

This documentation makes two clear promises for keys starting with digits:
1. The items will NOT be saved in the mat file
2. A `MatWriteWarning` will be issued

### MATLAB Variable Naming Rules

According to MATLAB's official documentation (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/variable-names.html):
- Variable names must start with a letter
- Variable names cannot start with a digit
- Examples: "6x" is invalid, "x6" is valid

This confirms that MATLAB itself does not allow variable names starting with digits.

### Current Implementation Behavior

The actual behavior differs from the documentation:
- For keys starting with underscore (_):
  - ✓ Warning is issued: "Starting field name with a underscore (_test) is ignored"
  - ✓ Data is not saved

- For keys starting with digit (0-9):
  - ✗ No warning is issued
  - ✗ Data IS saved to the file

### Documentation vs Implementation Discrepancy

There is a clear discrepancy between:
1. What the documentation promises (warning + no save for digit-prefixed keys)
2. What the implementation does (no warning + saves digit-prefixed keys)

This is not a case of undefined behavior - the documentation explicitly defines what should happen with digit-prefixed keys. The implementation fails to match this documented behavior.

### Implications

1. **Data Integrity**: Files created with digit-prefixed keys may not be loadable in MATLAB, as MATLAB doesn't allow such variable names
2. **API Contract Violation**: The function doesn't behave as documented, breaking the API contract
3. **Inconsistency**: The handling of invalid keys is inconsistent (underscore vs digit prefixes behave differently)
