## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The issue occurs exactly as described:

### Direct Instantiation Test
When calling `NominalAttribute("test_attr", ())` with an empty tuple or list:
- **Expected**: Either successfully create an attribute with empty values, or raise a descriptive error
- **Actual**: Crashes with `ValueError: max() iterable argument is empty`

### Root Cause Confirmed
The crash occurs at line 103 in `/home/npc/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/io/arff/_arffread.py`:
```python
self.dtype = (np.bytes_, max(len(i) for i in values))
```

When `values` is empty, the generator expression `(len(i) for i in values)` produces no elements, causing `max()` to fail with the error "max() iterable argument is empty".

### Test Results
1. **Direct instantiation with empty tuple**: Crashes with ValueError as reported
2. **Direct instantiation with empty list**: Same crash
3. **Loading ARFF with empty nominal `{}`**: Actually fails earlier in parsing with ParseArffError "This does not look like a nominal string"

The bug is real and occurs exactly as the report describes. The error message is indeed confusing and unhelpful - it doesn't explain that the issue is that nominal attributes require at least one value.

### Impact
This is a legitimate crash that occurs when:
- Users programmatically create NominalAttribute objects with empty value lists
- Processing ARFF data that might have empty nominal attributes (though the parser catches this earlier)

The current error message "max() iterable argument is empty" provides no guidance to users about what went wrong or how to fix it.
