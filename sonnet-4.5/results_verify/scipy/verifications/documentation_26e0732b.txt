DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

SciPy Documentation Review:
---------------------------
The official documentation for scipy.sparse.linalg.spbandwidth states:

1. Function Purpose: "Return the lower and upper bandwidth of a 2D numeric array"

2. Key Statement: "A zero denotes no sub/super diagonal entries on that side (triangular)"
   - This clearly indicates that returning (0, 0) is meaningful and expected

3. Return Value Definition: "The distance to the farthest non-zero diagonal below/above the main diagonal"

4. Important Note: "Only the sparse structure is used here. Values are not checked for zeros."
   - This means the function looks at the sparse structure, not actual values

5. Examples Provided:
   - Identity matrix returns (0, 0) - all non-zeros are on the main diagonal
   - The documentation shows this is a valid return value

Mathematical Definition:
------------------------
From mathematical literature, bandwidth is well-defined for zero matrices:
- Lower bandwidth p: a_ij = 0 whenever i > j + p
- Upper bandwidth q: a_ij = 0 whenever j > i + q
- For a zero matrix, ALL entries are zero, so bandwidth = (0, 0) is the correct mathematical result

Comparison with Other Libraries:
---------------------------------
MATLAB's bandwidth function documentation explicitly states:
"By convention, the upper and lower bandwidths of an empty matrix are both zero."

This establishes a precedent that zero/empty matrices should return (0, 0) for bandwidth.

Documentation Conclusion:
-------------------------
The documentation does NOT:
- Restrict the function to matrices with non-zero elements
- State that zero matrices are invalid input
- Mention any expected error for zero matrices
- Include any warnings about zero matrices

The documentation DOES:
- Clearly define that (0, 0) is a valid return value
- Show that identity matrices return (0, 0)
- State that "zero denotes no sub/super diagonal entries"

Therefore, a zero matrix should logically return (0, 0) as it has no non-zero entries
outside (or on) the main diagonal. The current crash behavior is inconsistent with
the documented interface and mathematical expectations.
