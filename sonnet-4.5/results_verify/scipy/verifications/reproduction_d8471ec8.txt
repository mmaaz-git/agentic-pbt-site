BUG REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
========================

REPRODUCTION STATUS: CONFIRMED - The bug reproduces exactly as described.

TEST RESULTS:

1. Property-Based Test:
   - The Hypothesis test fails as reported
   - Multiple failing cases found with non-negative inputs producing negative cumulative differences

2. Specific Failing Case:
   Input: y = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   Output: cumulative_simpson(y, initial=0) = [0, -0.08333333, 0.33333333]
   Issue: The cumulative integral decreases from 0 to -0.08333333, then increases to 0.33333333

   This is mathematically impossible because:
   - All y values are non-negative (0, 0, 1)
   - The integral from 0 to 1 of a non-negative function cannot be negative
   - The cumulative integral must be monotonically non-decreasing

3. Additional Cases Found:
   - y = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]: Also produces negative difference (-0.08333333 at the last step)
   - Multiple other configurations trigger the same issue

4. Comparison with cumulative_trapezoid:
   - cumulative_trapezoid correctly maintains monotonicity for all test cases
   - For y = [0, 0, 1]: trapezoid gives [0, 0, 0.5] (monotonic)
   - For y = [1, 0, 0]: trapezoid gives [0, 0.5, 0.5] (monotonic)

5. Mathematical Verification:
   The fundamental theorem of calculus states that for f(x) ≥ 0:
   F(x) = ∫[a to x] f(t) dt is a non-decreasing function

   The bug violates this fundamental property. The function produces:
   - Negative cumulative integrals for non-negative functions
   - Non-monotonic cumulative results

6. Root Cause Analysis:
   Looking at the implementation, the issue stems from the asymmetric correction formulas
   used in Simpson's rule cumulative integration. The formula from equation (8) of
   Cartwright's paper includes negative coefficients that can produce negative
   sub-integrals even when all input values are non-negative.

CONCLUSION:
The bug is real and reproducible. The function violates a fundamental mathematical
property that cumulative integrals of non-negative functions must be non-decreasing.
This is not just a numerical accuracy issue but a fundamental algorithmic problem.
