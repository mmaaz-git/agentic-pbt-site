Bug Reproduction Report
=======================

The bug was successfully reproduced using both methods provided in the bug report.

1. Hypothesis Test:
   - The test fails with IndexError: string index out of range
   - Falsifying example: test_split_data_line_empty_string(line='')
   - The test immediately crashes when passed an empty string

2. Direct Reproduction:
   - Calling split_data_line('') directly raises IndexError: string index out of range
   - The error occurs at line 476 in _arffread.py: if line[-1] == '\n':
   - The code attempts to access the last character of an empty string

Root Cause:
-----------
The function split_data_line() attempts to check if the last character is a newline (line 476) without first verifying that the string is non-empty. When an empty string is passed, line[-1] causes an IndexError.

How Empty Strings Can Occur:
-----------------------------
1. In line 374, split_data_line is called on results from escaped_string.split("\n")
   - If escaped_string contains double newlines ("\n\n"), split() will produce empty strings

2. In line 865, split_data_line is called but empty lines are filtered by r_empty regex
   - However, r_empty = re.compile(r'^\s+$') only matches lines with whitespace
   - Completely empty strings ('') do NOT match r_empty and would pass through

3. In line 130, split_data_line is called on regex match groups
   - Could theoretically produce empty strings if the regex matches empty content

The bug is real and reproducible.
