## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Hypothesis Test Results

The Hypothesis property-based test failed as reported, finding the counterexample:
- M=3, beta=710.0
- Error: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide
- Result: Kaiser window returned [0. nan 0.] instead of finite values

### Simple Test Case Results

The simple reproduction case confirmed the behavior:
- Input: windows.kaiser(3, 710.0)
- Output: [0. nan 0.]
- NaN present: Yes
- All values finite: No
- RuntimeWarning generated about invalid value in divide operation

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurs in the implementation at line 1301 of _windows.py:
```python
w = (special.i0(beta * xp.sqrt(1 - ((n - alpha) / alpha) ** 2.0)) /
     special.i0(xp.asarray(beta, dtype=xp.float64)))
```

Investigation of the Bessel function behavior revealed:
- special.i0(710.0) returns inf (infinity)
- special.i0(beta * sqrt(...)) for middle values also returns inf
- Division inf/inf results in NaN

The numerical overflow occurs because:
1. The modified Bessel function i0 grows exponentially with its argument
2. i0(710) exceeds the maximum float64 value (~1.8e308) and returns inf
3. When both numerator and denominator are inf, the result is NaN

### Verification

The bug is reproducible and behaves exactly as described in the report:
- The function returns NaN values for large beta (>=710) with small M
- A RuntimeWarning is issued but no exception is raised
- The NaN values propagate silently unless explicitly checked
