## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

1. **Exact reported case confirmed**: When both input vectors are zero vectors [0, 0, 0], the function returns `nan`, not 0.0 as the bug report claims should happen.

2. **Function behavior**:
   - cosine([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]) = nan âœ“ (confirmed)
   - cosine([0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3]) = nan (one zero vector also returns nan)
   - cosine([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) = 0.0 (non-zero identical vectors correctly return 0)

3. **Hypothesis test fails**: The property test from the bug report fails with the message "Distance nan out of range for u=[0.0], v=[0.0]" because nan is not in the range [0.0, 2.0].

4. **Mathematical analysis**:
   - For zero vectors: dot product = 0, norm of each = 0
   - Cosine similarity = 0 / (0 * 0) = 0/0 = undefined
   - Cosine distance = 1 - undefined = undefined (represented as nan)

5. **Implementation details**:
   - `cosine` delegates to `correlation(u, v, w=w, centered=False)`
   - `correlation` performs: `dist = 1.0 - uv / math.sqrt(uu * vv)`
   - When both vectors are zero: uu = vv = 0, so math.sqrt(0*0) = 0
   - Division by zero occurs, resulting in nan
   - SciPy emits RuntimeWarning for "divide by zero" and "invalid value"

### Key Findings

1. The bug report is technically correct that cosine([0,0,0], [0,0,0]) returns nan
2. The bug report's assertion that it should return 0.0 is the contentious point
3. The current implementation follows standard mathematical behavior (0/0 = undefined)
4. The function does not explicitly handle the zero vector case
5. The documentation does not specify what should happen for zero vectors
