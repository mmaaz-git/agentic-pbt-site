BUG REPORT TRIAGE ANALYSIS
==========================

Let me analyze this bug report against each possible category:

1. INVALID
   Arguments FOR:
   - The negative error codes are EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED in the official scipy documentation
   - The function behaves exactly as specified: error_num = -2 for convergence errors
   - The bug report's assertion that "error codes should be non-negative" is incorrect
   - Many C/Cython APIs use negative error codes (this is common practice)
   - The test assertion "error_num >= 0" is based on a false assumption

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The local docstring doesn't mention the specific error codes
   - The inconsistency with standard scipy API could be confusing

   VERDICT: STRONG case for INVALID - the behavior is documented and intentional

2. WONTFIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - This could be considered a trivial issue if we only consider the docstring
   - The Cython API is likely used by a small subset of users
   - Changing error codes would break backward compatibility

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - This isn't an obscure edge case - it's core functionality
   - The error handling is a fundamental part of the API

   VERDICT: Weak case - this isn't trivial enough for WONTFIX

3. DOCUMENTATION_FIX
   Arguments FOR:
   - The local function docstring doesn't specify what error codes mean
   - The docstring could be improved to match the online documentation
   - Adding error code meanings to the docstring would prevent confusion
   - The bug reporter's fix suggestion is to update the documentation

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The behavior itself is correct and documented online
   - This isn't really a "bug" in documentation, just incomplete local docs

   VERDICT: MODERATE case - the docstring could be more complete

4. FEATURE_REQUEST
   Arguments FOR:
   - The reporter wants consistency with standard scipy API (exceptions vs codes)
   - Requesting better error handling could be seen as a new feature

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The current behavior is intentional for Cython/C performance
   - This is about existing functionality, not new features
   - Changing to exceptions would break the API contract

   VERDICT: Weak case - this isn't really a feature request

5. BUG
   Arguments FOR:
   - The local docstring is incomplete about error codes

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The function works exactly as documented in official documentation
   - Negative error codes are valid and intentional
   - The test's assertion is based on incorrect assumptions
   - The behavior matches the specification

   VERDICT: VERY WEAK case - this is not a bug in the code

FINAL ANALYSIS:
The strongest cases are for INVALID or DOCUMENTATION_FIX. Since the behavior is
correctly documented in the official scipy documentation and the function works
as designed, this should be INVALID. The test's assumption that error codes must
be non-negative is incorrect. However, if we're being generous, it could be
reclassified as DOCUMENTATION_FIX to improve the local docstring.
