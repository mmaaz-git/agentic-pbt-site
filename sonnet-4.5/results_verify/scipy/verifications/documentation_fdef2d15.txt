DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR scipy.datasets.face
==============================================

1. OFFICIAL SCIPY DOCUMENTATION:
The official SciPy documentation for scipy.datasets.face is minimal:
- Function returns a 1024 x 768 image of a raccoon face
- Has one parameter 'gray' (bool, optional): If True returns 8-bit grayscale, otherwise color
- Returns ndarray with shape (768, 1024, 3) for color or (768, 1024) for grayscale
- Documentation does NOT specify:
  * Which grayscale conversion method is used
  * What coefficients are used for RGB to grayscale conversion
  * Whether any particular standard (Rec. 601, Rec. 709, etc.) is followed
  * Whether coefficients should sum to 1.0

2. SOURCE CODE EXAMINATION:
The actual implementation shows:
- Grayscale conversion uses: 0.21 * R + 0.71 * G + 0.07 * B
- These coefficients sum to 0.99, not 1.0
- The coefficients appear to be simplified/rounded versions similar to Rec. 709

3. GRAYSCALE CONVERSION STANDARDS:
Industry standards for grayscale conversion:
- Rec. 709 (HDTV): 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B = 1.0
- Rec. 601 (NTSC): 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B = 1.0
- Both standards ensure coefficients sum to 1.0 to preserve brightness/luminance

4. KEY FINDINGS:
- The documentation does NOT specify any requirements for grayscale conversion
- The documentation does NOT promise brightness preservation
- The documentation does NOT claim to follow any specific standard
- The function is described as a simple utility to get a test image
- No performance or accuracy guarantees are documented

CONCLUSION:
The documentation is completely silent on the technical details of grayscale conversion. It neither specifies that coefficients should sum to 1.0, nor that any particular standard should be followed. The function appears to be a simple utility for getting a test image, not a reference implementation of grayscale conversion.
