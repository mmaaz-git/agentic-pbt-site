Bug Report Reproduction Analysis
================================

## Summary
I have successfully reproduced the inconsistency described in the bug report. The bug report is accurate in its description.

## Reproduction Steps Performed

1. Ran the provided reproduction code that inspects the source code of both functions
2. Ran the property-based test that confirms the inconsistency
3. Directly examined the source files to verify the User-Agent headers

## Findings

### fetch_data() function (in _fetchers.py):
- Uses: `headers={"User-Agent": f"SciPy {sys.modules['scipy'].__version__}"}`
- This resolves to: "SciPy 1.16.2" (includes version number)
- Location: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/scipy_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/datasets/_fetchers.py

### download_all() function (in _download_all.py):
- Uses: `headers={"User-Agent": "SciPy"}`
- This resolves to: "SciPy" (no version number)
- Location: /home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/scipy_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/datasets/_download_all.py

## Verification Results

1. The reproduction code outputs clearly show the inconsistency
2. The property-based test passes, confirming the code inspection detects the inconsistency
3. Direct grep of the source files confirms:
   - fetch_data() includes the scipy version in User-Agent
   - download_all() does NOT include the version in User-Agent

## Effect

Both functions perform essentially the same operation (downloading dataset files from scipy servers) but identify themselves differently to the server via HTTP headers. This is an inconsistency in the codebase where two functions with similar purposes use different User-Agent formats.

The bug report accurately describes this inconsistency.
