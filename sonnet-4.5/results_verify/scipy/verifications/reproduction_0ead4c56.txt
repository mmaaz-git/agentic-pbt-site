BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

1. INITIAL TEST CASE (from bug report):
   Input: [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]
   Weights: [1., 1., 1., 1.] (even-length, symmetric)

   Results with mode='constant':
   - correlate1d: [2. 3. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 3.]
   - convolve1d(reversed): [3. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 3. 2.]
   - CONFIRMED: Results differ (max difference = 1.0)

   NumPy comparison:
   - np.correlate: [2. 3. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 3.]
   - np.convolve(reversed): [2. 3. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 3.]
   - NumPy maintains the relationship correctly

2. TESTING ACROSS DIFFERENT MODES:

   mode='constant': FAILS - Relationship does not hold
   mode='nearest': PASSES - Relationship holds
   mode='reflect': PASSES - Relationship holds
   mode='wrap': PASSES - Relationship holds
   mode='mirror': PASSES - Relationship holds

   CONFIRMED: Bug is specific to mode='constant'

3. ODD vs EVEN LENGTH KERNELS:

   Odd-length kernel [1., 2., 3.]:
   - mode='constant': PASSES - Relationship holds
   - correlate1d(x, w, origin=o) == convolve1d(x, w[::-1], origin=-o) for all valid o

   Even-length kernel [1., 2., 3., 4.]:
   - mode='constant': FAILS - Relationship does not hold with origin=0
   - Found pattern: correlate1d(origin=o) == convolve1d(reversed, origin=-o-1)
   - NOT the expected: correlate1d(origin=o) == convolve1d(reversed, origin=-o)

4. KEY FINDING:

   The issue is specifically with EVEN-LENGTH kernels in mode='constant'.

   For even-length kernels:
   - correlate1d(origin=0) == convolve1d(reversed, origin=-1) (not origin=0)
   - correlate1d(origin=1) == convolve1d(reversed, origin=-2) (not origin=-1)

   This suggests an off-by-one issue in the origin calculation for even-length kernels.

5. HYPOTHESIS TEST:

   Ran property-based testing with 20 random inputs.
   Multiple failures found, confirming the bug is reproducible with various inputs.

6. MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION:

   Manually verified that:
   - convolve1d(x, w) == correlate1d(x, w[::-1]) holds for odd kernels
   - This is the correct internal implementation

   But the inverse relationship:
   - correlate1d(x, w) == convolve1d(x, w[::-1])
   - FAILS for even-length kernels with mode='constant'

CONCLUSION:
The bug is CONFIRMED and reproducible. It specifically affects even-length kernels when using mode='constant', where the mathematical relationship between correlation and convolution is violated due to an apparent off-by-one error in the origin/boundary handling.
