## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The current behavior is internally consistent and follows a clear pattern - when index=None with labels, it sums all non-zero labels. This is a reasonable interpretation given that in image processing, label 0 conventionally represents background pixels that are often excluded from measurements. The function behaves predictably and deterministically. The user's expectation that index=None should include label 0 is not explicitly supported by the documentation, which doesn't specify the exact behavior for this case.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation states the function will "Calculate the sum of the values of the array" without any qualification about excluding certain labels. The behavior is genuinely surprising and inconsistent with how None typically works in NumPy/SciPy APIs where it usually means "all". The fact that explicitly passing index=[0,1] includes label 0 but index=None excludes it creates an inconsistency that users would not expect.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This behavior has likely been in scipy for many years and changing it would break backward compatibility for existing code that relies on label 0 being excluded. The convention of treating label 0 as background is well-established in image processing, and many users may expect and depend on this behavior. The issue only affects a specific edge case (using index=None with labels containing 0) and users can easily work around it by explicitly specifying the labels they want.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not a trivial issue - it affects core functionality and violates user expectations about API consistency. The behavior causes actual incorrect results in scientific computations where label 0 has meaning. The issue is not about error messages or minor inconveniences but about the function returning mathematically different results than expected. Users calculating statistics on labeled data would get wrong results if they assume index=None means "all labels".

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior is consistent and follows image processing conventions where label 0 represents background. The real issue is that this special treatment of label 0 is not documented. Adding a clear note in the documentation explaining that "when index=None, all non-zero labels are summed (label 0 is excluded as it conventionally represents background)" would resolve the confusion while preserving backward compatibility. The code works as designed but the design intent is not communicated.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
Simply documenting this behavior doesn't address the fundamental inconsistency in the API. The function name and primary description suggest it calculates "the sum of the values of the array" without qualification. If the function is meant to exclude certain values, it should be more explicit in its naming or have a parameter to control this behavior. Documentation alone doesn't fix the unintuitive API design.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is essentially asking for new functionality - the ability to sum all labels including label 0 when using index=None. This could be implemented as a new parameter like `include_background=True` or a special value like `index='all'` to provide the expected behavior while maintaining backward compatibility. This would enhance the API to support both use cases explicitly.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The user is not asking for new functionality but pointing out that the existing functionality doesn't work as documented and expected. The expectation that index=None should include all labels is reasonable given NumPy/SciPy conventions. This is about fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new features. The function already supports summing label 0 when explicitly specified, so the capability exists.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The function violates the principle of least surprise and API consistency within NumPy/SciPy where None typically means "all" or "default to all". The documentation says "Calculate the sum of the values of the array" without mentioning exclusions. The inconsistency between index=[0,1] (includes 0) and index=None (excludes 0) is objectively confusing. Users performing scientific computations would get incorrect results if they reasonably assume index=None processes all labels.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The behavior is consistent, deterministic, and likely intentional based on image processing conventions. Label 0 as background is a well-established convention in the field. The function works correctly for its intended use case in image processing where background pixels should be excluded from measurements. The documentation doesn't explicitly promise that index=None includes all labels, leaving room for this interpretation.

**Overall consideration**
After careful analysis, this appears to be primarily a DOCUMENTATION_FIX issue. The current behavior, while surprising to users unfamiliar with image processing conventions, is internally consistent and likely intentional. The function treats label 0 specially because in image processing contexts (which is what ndimage is designed for), label 0 conventionally represents background pixels that are typically excluded from object measurements.

The key evidence supporting this is that the behavior is completely consistent across all test cases - label 0 is always excluded when index=None. This consistency suggests deliberate design rather than a bug. Additionally, the module name "ndimage" (n-dimensional image) indicates this is specifically designed for image processing where the label 0 convention is standard.

However, the documentation absolutely needs to be updated to clearly explain this behavior. The current documentation's statement that it will "Calculate the sum of the values of the array" is misleading when it actually excludes label 0. A documentation update should explicitly state that when index=None with labels, the function sums all non-zero labels, treating label 0 as background that is excluded from the measurement. This would prevent confusion while preserving the current behavior that existing code may depend on.
