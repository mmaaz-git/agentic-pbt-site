REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR SCIPY.SPARSE MULTIPLICATION BY ZERO BUG REPORT

I successfully reproduced the behavior described in the bug report. Here are the results:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION TEST:
   - Created a 2x2 CSR matrix with nnz=2 (values [5.0, 3.0])
   - After multiplying by 0:
     * nnz remained 2 (not reduced to 0)
     * data array contains [0., 0.] (explicit zeros)
     * The matrix correctly represents all zeros when converted to dense
   - This confirms the bug report's claim about explicit zeros being retained

2. PROPERTY-BASED TEST:
   - Ran 41 test cases with randomly generated sparse matrices
   - ALL 41 tests failed the assertion that nnz should be 0 after multiplication by 0
   - Every single sparse matrix retained its original nnz count after multiplication by zero
   - The matrices correctly represent all zeros mathematically, but store explicit zeros

3. MINIMAL TEST CASE:
   - Tested with simplest case: 1x1 matrix with value [1.0]
   - After multiplication by 0: nnz=1, data=[0.]
   - Confirms the issue occurs even in the simplest case

4. ELIMINATE_ZEROS() VERIFICATION:
   - After multiplying by 0, calling eliminate_zeros() correctly reduces nnz to 0
   - This confirms that the explicit zeros CAN be removed, but it requires an extra method call
   - The eliminate_zeros() method works as expected to clean up the sparse structure

5. FORMAT-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR:
   - Tested multiple sparse formats with same data:
     * CSR: nnz stays 2 after *0
     * CSC: nnz stays 2 after *0
     * COO: nnz stays 2 after *0
     * DOK: nnz stays 2 after *0
     * LIL: nnz BECOMES 0 after *0 (different behavior!)
   - Interestingly, LIL format automatically eliminates zeros, while others don't

TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS:
- The mathematical result is correct (all values are zero)
- The sparse structure retains explicit zeros instead of eliminating them
- The nnz property accurately reports stored values including explicit zeros
- The behavior is consistent across most formats (except LIL)

SUMMARY:
The bug report's technical claims are accurate. Multiplication by zero does leave explicit zeros in the sparse structure for most formats (CSR, CSC, COO, DOK), though not for LIL format. The nnz count remains unchanged after multiplication by zero, which could be considered inefficient from a memory perspective.
