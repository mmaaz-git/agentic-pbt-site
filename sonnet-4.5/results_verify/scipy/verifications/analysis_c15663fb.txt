TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

BUG (Valid Bug Report)
-----------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The function fails on mathematically valid input ([0, 1] represents polynomial constant 1)
- The documentation specifies no restriction on leading zeros
- The error message itself says "BUG: filter coefficient a[0] == 0 not supported yet"
- The documented contract "signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder" should hold for all valid polynomials
- numpy.polydiv (referenced as equivalent) handles this case correctly by normalizing
- The fix is straightforward: strip leading zeros before processing
- The function works correctly when the leading zero is manually removed

Arguments AGAINST:
- None identified

INVALID (Incorrect Report)
--------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- None - the bug is reproducible and violates documented behavior

Arguments AGAINST:
- The bug reproduces exactly as reported
- The mathematical interpretation is correct
- The documentation doesn't exclude this case

WONTFIX (Trivial/Uninteresting)
--------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Users could work around by manually stripping leading zeros
- The error comes from low-level C code that might be hard to change

Arguments AGAINST:
- This is not an obscure edge case - polynomial operations commonly produce leading zeros
- The error message itself admits it's a "BUG" that's "not supported yet"
- The workaround requires users to understand internal implementation details
- The fix is simple and improves consistency with numpy.polydiv

FEATURE_REQUEST (Not Currently Supported)
-----------------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- The error says "not supported yet" suggesting it's a missing feature

Arguments AGAINST:
- The documentation doesn't say this is unsupported
- Mathematically, this should work - it's not a new capability
- The function already handles polynomial division, just not all valid representations
- It's a bug in handling valid input, not a request for new functionality

DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Docs Are Wrong)
----------------------------------
Arguments FOR:
- Could document that leading zeros are not supported

Arguments AGAINST:
- The code is wrong, not the documentation
- The documentation correctly describes what the function should do
- Documenting a limitation would be accepting a bug rather than fixing it
- The mathematical contract in the docs is correct and should be upheld

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This is clearly a BUG. The function fails to handle mathematically valid input that should work according to its documented contract. The error message itself identifies this as a "BUG" that is "not supported yet". The fix is straightforward (normalize polynomials by stripping leading zeros), and this would bring the behavior in line with both the documentation and the related numpy.polydiv function.
