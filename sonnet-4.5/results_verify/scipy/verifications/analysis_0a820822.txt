## Bug Report Analysis and Triage

### Consideration for BUG
**Arguments FOR:**
- The function returns NaN for identical inputs ([False] and [False]), violating the fundamental property of distance metrics that d(x,x) = 0
- The jaccard function in the same module was fixed in v1.2.0 for this exact issue, establishing clear precedent
- The behavior is undocumented - users have no warning that NaN can be returned
- The NaN result breaks downstream code that expects numeric comparisons (NaN != NaN)
- The fix is straightforward and matches the established pattern in jaccard
- This is a legitimate mathematical edge case (0/0) that needs handling

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise any specific behavior for all-False inputs
- Some might argue this is undefined behavior per the mathematical formula

**Verdict:** STRONG case for BUG

### Consideration for INVALID
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't specify what happens with all-False inputs
- The mathematical formula inherently produces 0/0 which is undefined
- User could validate inputs before calling the function

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Distance metrics have well-established properties (d(x,x)=0) that users rightfully expect
- The jaccard function handles this case properly, setting user expectations
- NaN is never mentioned as a possible return value in the documentation
- Identical inputs should have zero distance - this is fundamental to distance metrics

**Verdict:** WEAK case for INVALID

### Consideration for WONTFIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- This is an extreme edge case (both arrays all False)
- Users can work around it by checking inputs

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - empty sets are common in real applications
- The jaccard function was explicitly fixed for this, showing scipy cares about this case
- The fix is trivial and matches existing code patterns
- NaN propagates through calculations causing hard-to-debug issues

**Verdict:** WEAK case for WONTFIX

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be viewed as requesting new functionality to handle edge cases
- The current behavior might be considered "working as designed" per the formula

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new features
- Distance metrics have expected mathematical properties that aren't being met
- The jaccard fix was treated as a bug fix, not a feature

**Verdict:** WEAK case for FEATURE_REQUEST

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation could be updated to warn about NaN for all-False inputs
- Could document that users need to handle this edge case

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The behavior itself is problematic and should be fixed in code
- Documenting broken behavior doesn't make it correct
- The jaccard function fixed the code, not just the documentation
- Users expect distance metric properties to hold without special documentation

**Verdict:** WEAK case for DOCUMENTATION_FIX

### Final Analysis
This is clearly a BUG. The strongest evidence is:

1. **Precedent**: scipy fixed this exact issue in jaccard (v1.2.0), changing NaN to 0.0 for all-zero inputs
2. **Mathematical correctness**: Distance between identical objects must be 0, regardless of content
3. **Consistency**: Other distance functions in scipy handle this case properly
4. **User impact**: NaN breaks downstream code and violates expected properties
5. **No documentation**: The current behavior is completely undocumented

The proposed fix is correct, minimal, and follows established patterns in the codebase.
