# Bug Triage Analysis

## BUG (Most Likely)

### Why this should be classified as BUG:
1. **Mathematically incorrect result**: The function returns A.T when it should return A for f(x) = Ax. This violates the fundamental definition of the Jacobian matrix.

2. **Affects common use case**: Using the `@` operator for matrix multiplication is standard in modern numpy code. This is not an obscure edge case.

3. **Inconsistent behavior**: The same mathematical operation gives different results depending on whether you use `@`, `np.matmul`, or `np.dot`. This violates the principle of least surprise.

4. **Silent failure**: The function returns a result without any warning or error, but the result is mathematically wrong. Users may not realize they're getting incorrect derivatives.

5. **Not a user error**: Users are correctly using documented numpy operations. There's no indication they should avoid `@` or `np.matmul`.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Less Likely)

### Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
1. The documentation could warn users about this behavior with matmul
2. Could document that functions must use np.dot for matrix operations

### Why it's NOT just DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
1. The result is mathematically incorrect, not just unexpected
2. Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it acceptable
3. The `@` operator is the standard, recommended way to do matrix multiplication in numpy

## FEATURE_REQUEST (Unlikely)

### Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:
1. Could be argued that proper matmul support is a new feature

### Why it's NOT FEATURE_REQUEST:
1. Computing correct Jacobians is the core functionality, not a new feature
2. The function already claims to compute Jacobians - it just does it incorrectly for this case

## WONTFIX (Very Unlikely)

### Why it might be WONTFIX:
1. If scipy considers this a numpy broadcasting issue beyond their control

### Why it's NOT WONTFIX:
1. This affects basic linear algebra operations, not obscure edge cases
2. scipy could handle the batching differently to avoid the issue
3. The mathematical incorrectness is too fundamental to ignore

## INVALID (Extremely Unlikely)

### Why it might be INVALID:
1. If there's some interpretation where A.T is the "correct" answer

### Why it's NOT INVALID:
1. The mathematical definition of the Jacobian is unambiguous
2. The bug report correctly identifies a real discrepancy
3. The test cases are valid and the expected behavior is correct

## Final Assessment

This is clearly a **BUG**. The function returns mathematically incorrect results for a common operation (matrix multiplication using `@`). This is not a documentation issue or feature request - it's a failure to correctly implement the mathematical definition of the Jacobian. The severity is high because:
- It silently returns wrong derivatives
- It affects standard numpy operations
- Users have no indication that their results are incorrect
- The workaround (using np.dot) is not obvious

The bug report is well-written, provides clear reproduction steps, correctly identifies the root cause, and suggests reasonable fixes. This should be tagged as BUG and addressed by the scipy team.
