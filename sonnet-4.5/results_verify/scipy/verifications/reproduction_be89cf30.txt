## Reproduction of Bug Report

### Summary
I successfully reproduced the bug reported for scipy.signal.windows.tukey with very small alpha values.

### Direct Reproduction
The bug was reproduced using the provided test case:
- Called `windows.tukey(2, 5e-324)`
- Result: `[0. nan]` - contains NaN value as reported
- Runtime warnings were generated:
  - "overflow encountered in divide" at line 946
  - "invalid value encountered in add" at line 946

### Hypothesis Test
The hypothesis test also failed as expected:
- The test asserts that all values should be non-negative and not NaN
- Failed on the explicit example with M=2, alpha=5e-324
- Assertion error: "Tukey window should not contain NaN values for M=2, alpha=5e-324"

### Mathematical Analysis
Further investigation revealed:
1. `5e-324` is a subnormal (denormalized) float number, well below Python's `sys.float_info.min` (2.225e-308)
2. The division `-2.0/alpha` with alpha=5e-324 results in `-inf` (negative infinity)
3. Computing `cos(infinity)` returns NaN
4. The NaN propagates through the rest of the calculation

### Edge Case Testing
Testing various alpha values showed:
- alpha=0.0: Works correctly, returns [1. 1.] (rectangular window)
- alpha=5e-324: Fails with NaN
- alpha=1e-300: Works, returns [0. 1.]
- alpha >= 1e-15: Works correctly
- Negative alpha values are correctly handled as rectangular windows

The bug occurs specifically when alpha is positive but so small that division by it causes overflow to infinity.
