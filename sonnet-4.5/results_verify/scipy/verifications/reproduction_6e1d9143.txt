REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

Bug Report Summary:
The bug report claims that tilbert/itilbert fail to round-trip correctly for length-2 arrays with zero mean, similar to a known issue with hilbert/ihilbert.

Reproduction Results:

1. Hypothesis Test Reproduction:
   - Ran the provided property-based test with 500 examples
   - Test FAILED on exactly the reported input: x_list=[0.0, 1.0]
   - After mean subtraction: [-0.5, 0.5]
   - Confirms the test case fails as reported

2. Manual Example Reproduction:
   - Ran the manual test case with x = [0.0, 1.0]
   - After mean subtraction: x = [-0.5, 0.5]
   - tilbert(x, h=0.5) returned [0. 0.]
   - itilbert(tilbert(x), h=0.5) returned [0. 0.]
   - Expected [-0.5, 0.5] but got [0. 0.]
   - The output exactly matches what the bug report claims

3. Comparison Test:
   - Length-3 array (odd): [-1. 0. 1.] correctly round-trips
   - Length-2 array (even): [-0.5, 0.5] fails to round-trip (returns zeros)
   - This confirms the behavior difference between odd and even-length arrays

Effect of the Bug:
For length-2 arrays with zero mean, the tilbert transform produces all zeros, which when passed through itilbert also produces all zeros. This causes complete information loss - the original signal cannot be recovered. The transform is not invertible for even-length arrays.

The reproduction is successful and the reported behavior is confirmed.
