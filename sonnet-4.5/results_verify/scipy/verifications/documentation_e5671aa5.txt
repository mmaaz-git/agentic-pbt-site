DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. Official Documentation States:
   - alpha parameter: "Shape parameter of the Tukey window, representing the fraction of the window inside the cosine tapered region"
   - Valid range: 0 to 1 (explicitly stated)
   - Special cases documented:
     * alpha=0: equivalent to rectangular window
     * alpha=1: equivalent to Hann window
   - Return value: ndarray window with maximum value normalized to 1

2. Mathematical Definition:
   - The Tukey window is a tapered cosine window
   - As alpha approaches 0, the window approaches a rectangular (boxcar) window
   - The mathematical formula involves division by alpha for the tapering regions

3. Expected Behavior Based on Documentation:
   - For ANY alpha in [0, 1], the function should return a valid window array
   - No mention of NaN being a valid return value
   - No mention of limitations on how small alpha can be (other than >= 0)
   - The function promises to return an ndarray with values normalized to max of 1

4. Documentation Gaps:
   - No mention of numerical precision limitations
   - No warning about extremely small alpha values
   - No discussion of potential overflow issues
   - No specification of behavior for denormalized or very small floats

5. Comparison with Similar Functions:
   - Other window functions in scipy.signal.windows handle edge cases gracefully
   - The function already handles alpha=0 as a special case (returns rectangular window)
   - Logical expectation: very small alpha (e.g., 1e-313) should behave like alpha=0

6. Conclusion:
   - The documentation clearly states alpha should work for any value in [0, 1]
   - Returning NaN for valid inputs violates the documented contract
   - The behavior for very small alpha should logically match alpha=0 (rectangular window)
