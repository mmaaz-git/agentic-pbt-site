## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Strong Arguments:**
1. **Inconsistent behavior**: The function validates datasets when cache exists but not when it doesn't exist
2. **Clear validation logic exists**: Lines 38-42 show deliberate validation with specific error messages
3. **Violates fail-fast principle**: Invalid inputs should be caught early, regardless of cache state
4. **User experience issue**: Users get different feedback for the same invalid input based on unrelated cache state
5. **The fix is straightforward**: Simply reorder the checks so validation happens before cache existence check

**Why this IS a bug:**
- The validation logic is clearly intentional (detailed error message with helpful guidance)
- The early return accidentally bypasses this validation
- This creates a race condition-like behavior where the same invalid input behaves differently

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Potential Arguments:**
1. Documentation doesn't explicitly promise ValueError for invalid datasets
2. When cache doesn't exist, there's nothing to clear anyway

**Why this is NOT invalid:**
- The validation code clearly shows intent to validate
- Silent failures are generally considered bugs in API design
- The inconsistent behavior is objectively problematic

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Potential Arguments:**
1. Low severity - only affects edge case of invalid input with non-existent cache
2. Has a workaround - users can check dataset validity themselves
3. Doesn't cause data corruption or crashes

**Why this should NOT be WONTFIX:**
- The fix is trivial and improves consistency
- Silent failures can lead to confusion and debugging time
- Consistent error handling is a basic API quality requirement

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Potential Arguments:**
1. Could argue that validation when cache doesn't exist is a "new feature"

**Why this is NOT a feature request:**
- The validation already exists in the code
- This is fixing inconsistent behavior, not adding new functionality
- The error handling is already implemented, just bypassed accidentally

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Potential Arguments:**
1. Could document that validation only occurs when cache exists

**Why this is NOT just a documentation issue:**
- The current behavior is clearly unintentional (validation logic exists)
- Documenting a bug doesn't make it correct behavior
- The inconsistent behavior is objectively problematic

### Final Assessment:
This is clearly a **BUG**. The function has explicit validation logic that should run consistently, but an early return statement accidentally bypasses it when the cache directory doesn't exist. This creates inconsistent behavior where invalid inputs are sometimes validated and sometimes not, based on an unrelated condition (cache directory existence). The fix is straightforward and improves API consistency.
