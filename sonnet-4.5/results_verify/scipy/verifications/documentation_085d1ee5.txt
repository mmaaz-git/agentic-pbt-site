Documentation Findings for scipy.io.arff.split_data_line

1. Official SciPy Documentation:
   - The scipy.io.arff.loadarff function is documented to read ARFF files and convert them to NumPy arrays
   - The documentation mentions the function can handle numeric and nominal attributes, and allows missing data
   - The documentation does NOT mention relational attributes at all in the official API documentation
   - There are no specific mentions of how newlines or empty lines should be handled within data fields

2. ARFF Format Specification:
   - According to the Weka ARFF format documentation, relational attributes are defined with @attribute [name] relational syntax
   - Relational data must be "enclosed within double quotes" in the data section
   - The documentation notes relational attributes are "for multi-instance data (for future use)" in Weka, suggesting this is an experimental/advanced feature
   - The ARFF specification does not explicitly define how newlines within quoted relational data should be handled
   - There is no specification about whether trailing newlines within quoted strings are valid or invalid

3. Internal Implementation Details:
   - The split_data_line function is an internal function (not part of public API)
   - It is not documented in the public documentation
   - The function has no docstring specifying its expected input constraints
   - The function assumes it will receive non-empty strings (accesses line[-1] without checking)
   - RelationalAttribute.parse_data splits relational data on newlines and processes each line

4. Key Finding:
   The documentation does not specify whether relational attributes with trailing newlines are valid or invalid ARFF format. The public documentation doesn't even mention that relational attributes are supported, despite the implementation having code to handle them. This appears to be an undocumented feature.
