## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation states that `f` must be an "elementwise function", which in numpy/scipy parlance typically means a function that can operate on arrays element-by-element and return arrays of the same shape. A function that returns a scalar regardless of input shape arguably doesn't meet this requirement. The user could be misunderstanding what "elementwise function" means and should be writing functions that properly handle array inputs by returning arrays of matching shape.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The term "elementwise function" is not clearly defined in the documentation, and there's no explicit warning that scalar returns will fail. Mathematically, a constant function is perfectly valid and integrable. The integral of a constant is one of the most basic operations in calculus. The documentation doesn't provide examples of how to properly implement constant functions, nor does it warn against them.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This could be considered an edge case that's not worth fixing if the integrator is primarily designed for more complex functions. The workaround is trivial - users can write `lambda x: np.ones_like(x) * c` instead of `lambda x: c`. The fix might complicate the codebase for a rarely-used case, and users sophisticated enough to use scipy's integration functions should understand numpy broadcasting.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Constant functions are fundamental in mathematics and integration. This is not an obscure edge case - it's a basic use case that any integration routine should handle. The error message is cryptic and gives no hint about what went wrong or how to fix it. The crash happens deep in the implementation with an IndexError that provides no useful guidance to users.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation could be clearer about what "elementwise function" means and explicitly state that functions must return arrays with the same shape as their input. Adding an example of how to properly implement a constant function would prevent this confusion. The current documentation doesn't warn users that returning scalars will cause crashes, which could be easily added as a note.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The code is genuinely broken for a mathematically valid use case. Simply documenting the limitation doesn't make it acceptable that the integrator crashes on constant functions. This isn't a case where the behavior is correct but poorly documented - it's a case where the behavior is incorrect for a fundamental mathematical operation.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Supporting scalar-returning functions could be seen as a new feature if the integrator was explicitly designed only for vectorized functions. The user is asking for the integrator to handle a new class of functions (those returning scalars) that it wasn't originally designed to support. Adding automatic broadcasting of scalar returns to match input shapes would be a feature enhancement.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
Integrating constant functions is not a "feature" - it's a basic capability that any numerical integrator should have. This is fixing broken functionality, not adding new functionality. The mathematical operation (integrating a constant) is completely standard and should already be supported.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The integrator crashes with an uninformative error when given a mathematically valid, simple function. Constant functions are fundamental test cases for any integration routine. The crash occurs because the code doesn't properly handle the case where the integrand returns a scalar, which is a legitimate return type for a mathematical function. The error happens in internal array manipulation code that makes incorrect assumptions about array dimensions.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
If the function is explicitly documented as requiring "elementwise" behavior (even if poorly explained), then users not following this requirement could be considered user error. The scipy developers might have intentionally designed it to only work with properly vectorized functions for performance reasons.

## Overall consideration

Looking at all considerations, this appears to be a genuine bug in scipy.integrate.tanhsinh. The function crashes when attempting to integrate constant functions, which are among the most basic mathematical functions that any integrator should handle. The integral of a constant c from a to b is simply c*(b-a), and this is taught in introductory calculus courses.

The key evidence supporting this being a bug includes: (1) The error is a low-level IndexError rather than a meaningful exception about function requirements, (2) The documentation doesn't explicitly warn against constant functions or scalar returns, (3) Constant functions are mathematically valid and have well-defined integrals, and (4) The crash occurs in array indexing code that makes assumptions about dimensionality without checking.

While the documentation mentions "elementwise function," this term is not clearly defined, and it's reasonable for users to expect that a simple constant function would work. The fact that the fix is straightforward (checking array dimensions before indexing, or ensuring arrays are at least 1-D) and that workarounds exist doesn't negate that this is a bug - it just means it's a bug that's relatively easy to fix. This is a case where the implementation is genuinely incorrect for a valid mathematical use case, not a case of unclear documentation or missing features.
