## Documentation Analysis for scipy.stats.percentileofscore

Based on my review of the official scipy documentation and the function's docstring, here are the key findings:

### Documented Return Value Range
The function's docstring explicitly states in the Returns section:
```
Returns
-------
pcos : float
    Percentile-position of score (0-100) relative to `a`.
```

This clearly documents that the return value should be in the range [0, 100]. The documentation uses the notation "(0-100)" which, in standard mathematical and programming documentation, typically means the inclusive range from 0 to 100.

### Function Description
The function computes "the percentile rank of a score relative to a list of scores." The documentation explains that a percentileofscore of 80% means that 80% of the scores in `a` are below the given score.

### Calculation Methods
The function supports four different calculation methods via the `kind` parameter:
- 'rank': Average percentage ranking of score
- 'weak': Cumulative distribution function (values â‰¤ score)
- 'strict': Only values strictly less than score
- 'mean': Average of weak and strict scores

### Examples in Documentation
All examples in the documentation show results that are cleanly within the 0-100 range:
- stats.percentileofscore([1, 2, 3, 4], 3) returns 75.0
- stats.percentileofscore([1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 3) returns 70.0
- The documentation even shows an example returning exactly 100:
  stats.percentileofscore([-np.inf, 0, 1, np.inf], [1, 2, np.inf]) returns array([75., 75., 100.])

### No Mention of Floating-Point Issues
The documentation does not mention or warn about:
- Potential floating-point arithmetic issues that could cause results to exceed 100
- Any tolerance or epsilon values for the boundaries
- The possibility of results like 100.00000000000001

### Conclusion
The documentation clearly establishes that the function should return values in the range [0, 100]. There is no indication that values slightly exceeding 100 due to floating-point arithmetic are expected or acceptable behavior.
