REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR DCT TYPE 1 BUG REPORT

1. BUG REPRODUCTION:
Successfully reproduced the reported behavior:
- Single element array [0.0] with DCT Type 1 raises: RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested
- This happens with both norm='ortho' and norm=None
- The error is consistent and reproducible

2. COMPARISON WITH OTHER DCT TYPES:
Tested all DCT types with single element array [0.0]:
- DCT Type 1: RuntimeError: zero-length FFT requested
- DCT Type 2: Returns [0.] successfully
- DCT Type 3: Returns [0.] successfully
- DCT Type 4: Returns [0.] successfully

3. DCT TYPE 1 WITH LARGER ARRAYS:
- Two-element array [0.0, 1.0] works correctly
- Returns appropriate transformed values
- No errors with arrays of size > 1

4. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
- The property-based test immediately fails on the first example
- Failure occurs when hypothesis generates a single-element list with dct_type=1
- The test would pass for all other combinations that don't involve single elements with Type 1

5. ERROR TYPE ANALYSIS:
- The error is a RuntimeError, not a ValueError or other exception type
- Error message "zero-length FFT requested" suggests internal implementation issue
- The error occurs even though the input array is not zero-length (it has 1 element)

6. TECHNICAL ACCURACY OF BUG REPORT:
- The bug report accurately describes the behavior
- The reproduction code works as stated
- The error messages match exactly
- The comparison with other DCT types is accurate

IMPORTANT FINDING:
The bug report claims this is inconsistent behavior and a bug. However, the scipy documentation explicitly states that DCT Type 1 is "only supported for input size > 1". This means the observed behavior is EXPECTED according to the documentation, not a bug.
