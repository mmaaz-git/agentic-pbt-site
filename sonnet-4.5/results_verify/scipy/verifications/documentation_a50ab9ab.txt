## Documentation Analysis for scipy.optimize.bisect

### Official Documentation Review
I reviewed the official SciPy documentation for scipy.optimize.bisect and examined the source code implementation. Here are the key findings:

### Parameter Description
The documentation describes the parameters a and b as:
- a: "One end of the bracketing interval [a,b]"
- b: "The other end of the bracketing interval [a,b]"

The phrasing "one end" and "the other end" suggests that a and b are interchangeable endpoints of an interval, with no specific ordering requirement mentioned.

### Key Requirements Stated
The documentation explicitly requires:
1. f must be a continuous function
2. f(a) and f(b) must have opposite signs (ensuring a root exists by the Intermediate Value Theorem)
3. The algorithm is described as "slow but sure" and guaranteed to converge

### What the Documentation DOES NOT Say
Importantly, the documentation does NOT:
- Specify that a must be less than b
- Mention any requirement about the ordering of interval endpoints
- State that the algorithm should return the same root when endpoints are swapped
- Guarantee deterministic behavior regarding which root is found when multiple roots exist

### Multiple Roots Scenario
The documentation does not address the behavior when multiple roots exist within the interval. It only guarantees finding "a root" not "a specific root" or "the same root regardless of input order."

### Comparison with Related Functions
The bug report mentions that other root-finding methods (brentq, brenth, ridder) return the same root regardless of interval direction. However, this consistency is not documented as a requirement for bisect.

### Conclusion from Documentation
Based on the documentation alone, there is no explicit requirement that bisect should return the same root when the interval endpoints are swapped. The function is only required to find "a root" within the given interval where the function changes sign.
