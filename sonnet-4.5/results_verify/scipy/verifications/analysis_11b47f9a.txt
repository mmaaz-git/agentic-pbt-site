TRIAGE ANALYSIS
===============

Evaluating the bug report against each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Bug report is incorrect)
-------------------------------------
Arguments AGAINST INVALID:
- The bug is real and reproducible
- Documentation clearly states return values should be in [0, 100]
- The function returns 100.00000000000001, which exceeds 100
- This is not a case of misunderstanding the API

Arguments FOR INVALID:
- None. The bug clearly exists and violates documented behavior.

VERDICT: NOT INVALID

2. WONTFIX (Trivial/uninteresting bug)
---------------------------------------
Arguments FOR WONTFIX:
- The error is extremely small (1e-14 over 100)
- This is a typical floating point precision issue
- The practical impact is minimal for most use cases
- Floating point arithmetic errors of this magnitude are common

Arguments AGAINST WONTFIX:
- The documentation explicitly promises [0, 100] range
- Some downstream code may have strict validation (e.g., assert percentile <= 100)
- The fix is simple (clamp the output)
- Other statistical libraries handle this correctly
- It's a contract violation, even if small

VERDICT: POSSIBLE WONTFIX - The error is tiny and due to floating point precision

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
----------------------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR FEATURE_REQUEST:
- None. The function already claims to support returning values in [0, 100]

Arguments AGAINST FEATURE_REQUEST:
- This is not asking for new functionality
- The function already documents that it returns values in [0, 100]
- This is about fixing existing behavior, not adding new features

VERDICT: NOT FEATURE_REQUEST

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong)
----------------------------------------------
Arguments FOR DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- One could argue the documentation should mention floating point precision
- Documentation could be updated to say "approximately [0, 100]"

Arguments AGAINST DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
- The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior
- Percentiles by definition should be in [0, 100]
- The code should match the documentation, not vice versa
- Other functions like numpy.percentile enforce [0, 100] strictly

VERDICT: UNLIKELY DOCUMENTATION_FIX - The documentation is mathematically correct

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
----------------------------------------
Arguments FOR BUG:
- Clear violation of documented API contract
- Function returns value outside specified range [0, 100]
- Easy to fix with output clamping
- Could cause failures in downstream code with validation
- Mathematical definition of percentiles requires [0, 100]
- The proposed fix (np.clip) is simple and robust

Arguments AGAINST BUG:
- The error is due to floating point precision, not logic error
- The magnitude is negligible (1e-14)
- Many numerical computations have similar precision issues

VERDICT: LIKELY BUG - Contract violation that should be fixed

FINAL ANALYSIS
--------------
This case sits on the boundary between BUG and WONTFIX. Key considerations:

1. It's a clear contract violation (documentation says [0, 100])
2. The error is due to floating point arithmetic, not a logic bug
3. The magnitude is tiny but could still break strict validation
4. The fix is trivial (add np.clip)
5. SciPy is a scientific computing library where numerical precision matters

Given that:
- SciPy is used in scientific computing where precision and contracts matter
- The documentation makes an explicit promise about the range
- The fix is simple and has no downsides
- Similar functions in NumPy handle this correctly

This should be categorized as BUG rather than WONTFIX. While the error is tiny, it violates the API contract and could cause issues in production code that validates percentile ranges.
