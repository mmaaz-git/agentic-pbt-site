DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FOR Rotation.mean()

From the SciPy documentation and docstring:

Method Signature: Rotation.mean(self, weights=None)
- This is an INSTANCE method (note the 'self' parameter)
- NOT a class method that accepts a list of Rotation objects

Purpose: Computes the chordal L2 mean of rotations within a Rotation instance

Parameters:
- self: The Rotation instance (implicit, contains the rotations to average)
- weights: Optional array of weights for weighted mean

Returns:
- A Rotation instance containing the mean rotation

2. CORRECT USAGE ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTATION:

The documentation example shows the correct usage:
```python
r = Rotation.from_euler('zyx', [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]], degrees=True)
r.mean()  # Called on instance containing multiple rotations
```

Key point: You create a SINGLE Rotation object containing MULTIPLE rotations,
then call mean() on that instance.

3. WHAT THE DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT SAY:

- The documentation does NOT mention calling Rotation.mean() as a class method
- It does NOT show examples of passing a list of Rotation objects to mean()
- It does NOT specify behavior for edge cases like single rotations
- It does NOT mention minimum number of rotations required

4. BUG REPORT'S INCORRECT ASSUMPTION:

The bug report assumes that Rotation.mean([r]) should work, where [r] is a list
containing a single Rotation object. This usage pattern is NOT documented or
supported according to the official documentation.

The bug report states: "A list containing a single Rotation object is valid input
according to the API" - This is INCORRECT. The API documentation does not show
this as valid usage.

5. THE ACTUAL BUG:

While the usage in the bug report is incorrect, the REAL BUG is that:
- Invalid usage causes a segmentation fault instead of a proper Python exception
- The Cython/C code lacks proper input validation
- Users get no helpful error message about correct usage

6. DOCUMENTATION CLARITY:

The documentation could be clearer about:
- The fact that mean() is an instance method, not a class method
- How to properly create multi-rotation objects for averaging
- What happens with edge cases (single rotation, empty set)

However, the documentation IS clear that this is an instance method with
signature "self, weights=None", not a class method accepting rotation lists.
