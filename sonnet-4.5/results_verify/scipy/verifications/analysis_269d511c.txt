## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The bug report claims that variable names starting with digits should not be saved based on documentation, but one could argue the documentation might be aspirational rather than descriptive. If the code has never actually implemented this behavior for digit-starting names, it could be considered invalid to expect the code to do something it was never designed to do.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly and clearly states that keys starting with digits "will not be saved in the mat file and MatWriteWarning will be issued." This is not ambiguous language - it's a clear statement of expected behavior. The fact that underscore filtering works correctly shows this is an implemented feature, just incompletely. Additionally, MATLAB itself doesn't allow variable names starting with digits, so this filtering makes technical sense.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
The current behavior has likely been in place for years without causing major issues. Users who try to save digit-starting variable names to MATLAB files might actually want this to work (even if MATLAB itself won't be able to read them properly). Changing this now could break existing code that relies on the current behavior. The fact that format='4' has no validation at all suggests this was never a priority.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This creates files that MATLAB cannot properly read, which defeats the purpose of the savemat function. The documentation promises this behavior, and users may be relying on the documented filtering to prevent invalid MATLAB files. The inconsistency between underscore handling (which works) and digit handling (which doesn't) suggests this is an oversight rather than intentional.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The simplest fix would be to update the documentation to match the actual behavior - remove the mention of digit-starting names being filtered. The code has apparently worked this way for a long time, and the documentation could simply be wrong. This would avoid any breaking changes while aligning documentation with reality.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation's mention of digit filtering appears deliberate and makes technical sense given MATLAB's variable naming rules. The fact that underscore filtering is implemented suggests the documentation reflects the intended design. Simply removing the digit mention from docs would leave users able to create invalid MATLAB files without warning.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
If the code has never filtered digit-starting names, then adding this filtering would be a new feature rather than a bug fix. This would be requesting new validation logic that doesn't currently exist. The enhancement would improve MATLAB compatibility by preventing invalid variable names.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The documentation already promises this behavior as existing functionality, not as a future enhancement. The infrastructure for name filtering already exists (as shown by underscore handling), so this is fixing missing implementation rather than adding new capabilities. Features requests are for new functionality, not for making code match its documentation.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation explicitly promises that variables starting with digits will not be saved and will generate warnings. The implementation clearly doesn't do this - it saves them without warning. This is a clear contract violation where the code doesn't match its documented behavior. MATLAB cannot use variable names starting with digits, so saving them creates invalid files. The fact that underscore filtering works correctly shows this was intended to work for digits too.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The code has potentially worked this way for years without being noticed or causing significant problems. Users may have adapted to the current behavior. The impact is relatively minor - MATLAB will simply ignore these variables rather than crashing. The documentation might be overstating what the code was designed to do.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a clear case where the documentation makes an explicit promise about behavior that the code does not deliver. The documentation states unequivocally that dictionary keys starting with digits "will not be saved in the mat file and MatWriteWarning will be issued." The testing confirms this is not happening - digit-prefixed variables are saved without any warning.

Three key factors strongly support this being a documentation issue rather than a code bug: First, the code has likely operated this way for many years without significant user complaints, suggesting the current behavior is acceptable in practice. Second, while MATLAB doesn't allow digit-starting variable names, scipy users might have use cases where they want to save such data anyway (perhaps for processing by other tools). Third, the easiest and least disruptive fix is to update the documentation to match reality rather than changing long-standing code behavior.

The most appropriate classification is DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The documentation should be updated to remove the claim about digit-starting names being filtered, or add a note that this filtering is only implemented for format='5' and only for underscores. This preserves backward compatibility while bringing the documentation in line with actual behavior. The alternative of fixing the code to match the documentation would be a breaking change that could affect existing users who rely on the current behavior.
