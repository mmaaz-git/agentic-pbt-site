## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The behavior could be considered expected if we interpret "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero" as implying the round-trip won't work. The mathematical limitation is fundamental - the sign function is undefined at k=n/2, so information loss is inevitable. Users might be expected to understand this limitation from signal processing theory.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation explicitly states "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x" without any exceptions. There's no mention that this property fails for even-length arrays. The statement about Nyquist mode being zeroed is presented as an implementation detail, not as a limitation that breaks the documented round-trip property.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is a fundamental mathematical limitation of the discrete Hilbert transform that cannot be fixed without breaking mathematical conventions. The Nyquist frequency handling is standard in signal processing. The error only affects even-length arrays and users can work around it by using odd-length arrays. The issue has likely existed for years without major complaints.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
The documentation makes a specific promise that is broken. This isn't an obscure edge case but affects 50% of possible array lengths (all even lengths). The error magnitude can be significant (up to 50% in some cases). Users relying on the documented property for algorithm correctness will encounter silent failures.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The implementation is mathematically correct and follows standard signal processing conventions. The only issue is that the documentation overstates the round-trip property without mentioning the even-length limitation. A simple documentation update adding "for odd-length arrays" or "except for even-length arrays where Nyquist information is lost" would accurately describe the behavior.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation makes a clear mathematical claim that should be honored in the code. If the documentation needs to be changed, it suggests the API design itself is flawed. Users may have existing code that relies on the documented behavior.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The current behavior is correct but limited. A new parameter could be added to handle even-length arrays differently, perhaps by using a different convention for the Nyquist frequency or warning users. This would be adding new functionality rather than fixing broken code.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
The bug report isn't asking for new functionality but pointing out that existing documented functionality doesn't work. The documentation already claims this should work, so it's not a new feature but a failure to meet existing specifications.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The documentation makes an unqualified promise that hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x when sum(x)==0. This promise is broken for all even-length arrays. The documentation gives no warning about this limitation. Users writing code based on the documentation will encounter incorrect results. The failure is silent and could cause downstream errors in scientific computations.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
This is a fundamental mathematical limitation of the discrete Hilbert transform that exists in all implementations. The statement about zeroing the Nyquist mode could be interpreted as implying the limitation. Signal processing experts would know about this limitation even if not explicitly documented.

## Overall Consideration

This is a challenging case that sits at the intersection of mathematical correctness and documentation accuracy. The implementation is mathematically sound and follows standard signal processing conventions for handling the Nyquist frequency in even-length discrete Hilbert transforms. The fundamental issue is that the sign function is undefined at exactly k=n/2, making it impossible to define a Hilbert transform that preserves all information for even-length signals.

However, the documentation makes an explicit, unqualified promise about the round-trip property that is demonstrably false for even-length arrays. The documentation states "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x" without any caveats, exceptions, or warnings. A user reading this would reasonably expect it to work for all array lengths. The fact that the Nyquist mode is zeroed is mentioned separately as an implementation detail, not as a limitation that breaks the round-trip property.

Given that the behavior is mathematically correct but the documentation overpromises, this is most appropriately classified as a DOCUMENTATION_FIX. The documentation should be updated to accurately reflect the limitation for even-length arrays, perhaps stating "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x for odd-length arrays. For even-length arrays, the Nyquist component is zeroed, which may prevent perfect round-trip."
