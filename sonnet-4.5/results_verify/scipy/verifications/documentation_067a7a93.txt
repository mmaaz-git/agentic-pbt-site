# Documentation Analysis

## SciPy Documentation
According to the official SciPy documentation for `scipy.differentiate.jacobian`:

1. **Mathematical Definition**: The documentation states that for a function f: ℝ^m → ℝ^n, the Jacobian is an (n × m) matrix where each element represents ∂f_i/∂x_j.

2. **Shape Specification**: The documentation explicitly states:
   - For a single point evaluation with f: ℝ^m → ℝ^n
   - Input x must have shape (m,)
   - Output df (the Jacobian) will have shape (n, m)

3. **Vectorization**: When evaluating at k points:
   - x has shape (m, k)
   - df has shape (n, m, k)

## Standard Mathematical Definition
According to standard mathematical references (Wikipedia and textbooks):

1. **Jacobian Convention**: For f: ℝ^n → ℝ^m, the Jacobian J is an m × n matrix where:
   - J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j
   - Row i contains the gradient of f_i
   - Column j contains the partial derivatives with respect to x_j

2. **Matrix Structure**: The Jacobian should be:
   ```
   J = [∂f_1/∂x_1 ... ∂f_1/∂x_n]
       [    ...          ...     ]
       [∂f_m/∂x_1 ... ∂f_m/∂x_n]
   ```

## Critical Observation
The SciPy documentation uses a **different notation convention** than standard mathematics:
- SciPy notation: f: ℝ^m → ℝ^n produces (n, m) Jacobian
- Standard notation: f: ℝ^n → ℝ^m produces (m, n) Jacobian

However, both agree on the fundamental definition: J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j

## The Bug
Given the test case where f: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3 with f(x) = Ax:
- The correct Jacobian J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j = A[i,j]
- SciPy returns J where J[i,j] = A[j,i] (the transpose)

This violates both:
1. The standard mathematical definition
2. SciPy's own documented behavior that J[i,j] should equal ∂f_i/∂x_j

## Conclusion
The implementation contradicts both the mathematical standard and SciPy's own documentation. The function is computing J[j,i] = ∂f_i/∂x_j instead of J[i,j] = ∂f_i/∂x_j, resulting in a transposed Jacobian matrix.
