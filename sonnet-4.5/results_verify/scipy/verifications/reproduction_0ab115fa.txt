## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The Hypothesis test provided in the bug report runs successfully and confirms the bug. When I ran the test with non-callable values (integers, strings, floats), the test passed without raising any exceptions, confirming that `scipy.datasets.clear_cache()` does not raise the expected errors for invalid inputs.

### Manual Reproduction
I created a detailed test script that demonstrates the bug clearly:

1. **When cache directory does NOT exist**:
   - Passing `42` (integer) - No exception raised, function returns after printing "Cache Directory ... doesn't exist. Nothing to clear."
   - Passing `"not a callable"` (string) - No exception raised, same behavior
   - Passing `[1, 2, 3]` (list of integers) - No exception raised, same behavior

2. **When cache directory EXISTS**:
   - Passing `42` (integer) - AssertionError is raised as expected

### Confirmed Behavior
The bug report is accurate. The function exhibits inconsistent behavior:
- When the cache directory doesn't exist, invalid inputs (non-callables) are accepted without any validation
- When the cache directory exists, the same invalid inputs cause an AssertionError on line 36

### Root Cause
The issue is in `_clear_cache()` function in `/home/npc/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/datasets/_utils.py`:
- Lines 24-26: Early return when cache directory doesn't exist
- Line 36: `assert callable(dataset)` - This validation only happens after the early return check

The input validation (`assert callable(dataset)` on line 36) is never reached when the cache directory doesn't exist due to the early return on lines 24-26. This creates an inconsistency where the same invalid input is sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected based on filesystem state.
