BUG REPRODUCTION RESULTS
========================

1. TEST CASE REPRODUCTION:
The bug report's test case was successfully reproduced:
- Input: signal=[1.0, 1.0], divisor=[1.1754943508222875e-38, 1.0]
- Output: quotient=[8.50705917e+37], remainder=[0.0, -8.50705917e+37]
- Reconstructed signal: [1.0, 0.0] (should be [1.0, 1.0])
- The round-trip property is VIOLATED - reconstructed differs by 1.0 in the second element

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
Running the property-based test with hypothesis found multiple failures
- The test fails when divisor[0] is extremely small (around 1e-30 or smaller)
- The framework detected at least 2 distinct failure cases

3. THRESHOLD ANALYSIS:
Testing various divisor[0] values showed:
- divisor[0] = 0.5: Works correctly ✓
- divisor[0] = 1e-10: Works correctly ✓
- divisor[0] = 1e-30: FAILS ✗
- divisor[0] = 1.17e-38: FAILS ✗

The failure occurs when divisor[0] is around 1e-30 or smaller.

4. ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION:
The issue is caused by floating-point precision loss:
- When divisor[0] is tiny (e.g., 1e-38), lfilter normalizes by dividing by divisor[0]
- This creates a huge normalized coefficient: 1.0/1e-38 = 1e+38
- In floating-point arithmetic: (1e+38 + 1.0) - 1e+38 = 0.0 (not 1.0!)
- This precision loss propagates through the calculation, violating the round-trip property

5. MATHEMATICAL CORRECTNESS:
The claimed property "signal = convolve(divisor, quotient) + remainder" is mathematically sound and should hold for exact arithmetic. However:
- With divisor=[1e-38, 1.0], the quotient becomes [1e+38]
- convolve([1e-38, 1.0], [1e+38]) = [1.0, 1e+38]
- remainder = [0.0, -1e+38]
- sum = [1.0, 1e+38 - 1e+38] = [1.0, 0.0] due to floating-point cancellation
- This differs from the original signal [1.0, 1.0]

6. COMPARISON WITH NUMPY:
numpy.polydiv exhibits the same issue, suggesting this is a fundamental limitation of the polynomial division approach when using floating-point arithmetic with extremely small leading coefficients.

CONCLUSION:
The bug is CONFIRMED. The implementation violates its documented mathematical guarantee when divisor[0] is extremely small (around 1e-30 or less) due to catastrophic loss of precision in floating-point arithmetic.
