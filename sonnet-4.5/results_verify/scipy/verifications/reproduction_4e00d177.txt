## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

I successfully reproduced the bug exactly as described in the report:

1. **Using 'kaiser_bessel_derived' (with underscores) FAILS**:
   ```python
   windows.get_window(('kaiser_bessel_derived', 8.6), 10, fftbins=False)
   ```
   Result: `ValueError: Unknown window type.`

2. **Using 'kaiser bessel derived' (with spaces) SUCCEEDS**:
   ```python
   windows.get_window(('kaiser bessel derived', 8.6), 10, fftbins=False)
   ```
   Result: Successfully returns a 10-element window array

3. **Using 'kbd' alias SUCCEEDS**:
   ```python
   windows.get_window(('kbd', 8.6), 10, fftbins=False)
   ```
   Result: Successfully returns a 10-element window array

### Comparison with Other Windows

I tested other window functions that have underscores in their names:

1. **general_gaussian**: Both 'general_gaussian' AND 'general gaussian' work
2. **general_cosine**: Both 'general_cosine' AND 'general cosine' work
3. **general_hamming**: Both 'general_hamming' AND 'general hamming' work

This confirms the inconsistency: kaiser_bessel_derived is the ONLY window function with underscores that doesn't accept its actual function name as an identifier in get_window.

### Property-Based Test

The hypothesis test from the bug report fails for ALL beta values tested (0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 8.6, 10.0, 20.0). Each attempt to use 'kaiser_bessel_derived' results in "Unknown window type."

### Technical Verification

I verified that all three working forms ('kaiser bessel derived' with spaces and 'kbd') produce identical output when compared with the direct function call:
- `windows.kaiser_bessel_derived(10, beta=8.6, sym=True)` produces the same array as
- `windows.get_window(('kaiser bessel derived', 8.6), 10, fftbins=False)`
- `windows.get_window(('kbd', 8.6), 10, fftbins=False)`

All three produce numerically identical arrays (verified with np.allclose).

### Conclusion

The bug report is technically accurate:
1. The function name 'kaiser_bessel_derived' does not work with get_window
2. Only 'kaiser bessel derived' (spaces) or 'kbd' work
3. This is inconsistent with other similarly-named window functions
4. The error message "Unknown window type" is misleading since the window type does exist
