REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. Bug Confirmation
   - The bug reproduces exactly as reported with beta0=0.0, beta1=2.0
   - Without initial parameters: SSR = 96,329,616.45 (massive error)
   - With initial parameters [0.0, 2.0]: SSR = 0.0 (perfect fit)

2. Root Cause Verification
   - Confirmed the issue is in scipy/odr/_models.py, lines 81-83
   - The _exp_est() function returns hardcoded [1., 1.] for all inputs
   - Comment "# Eh." confirms this is a known incomplete implementation

3. Testing Scope
   - Documentation example (beta0=-10.0, beta1=0.5): WORKS (lucky coincidence)
   - Bug report case (beta0=0.0, beta1=2.0): FAILS with 96M SSR
   - Default estimate case (beta0=1.0, beta1=1.0): WORKS (matches hardcoded values)
   - Other cases tested show mixed results

4. Impact Assessment
   - The optimizer CAN find correct solutions when given proper initial estimates
   - The default estimation function provides poor starting points
   - This causes the optimizer to converge to local minima with huge errors
   - The issue affects a wide range of parameter values

5. Observable Effects
   - Fitting appears to complete successfully (no exceptions)
   - Returns parameters that produce massive residuals
   - Users without domain knowledge won't realize the fit failed
   - Silent failure is particularly dangerous for scientific applications

The bug is real, reproducible, and significant in impact.
