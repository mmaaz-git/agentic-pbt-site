## Documentation Analysis for scipy.special.pseudo_huber

### Official SciPy Documentation
The function is documented as:
- Mathematical formula: δ²(√(1 + (r/δ)²) - 1)
- Parameters: delta (array_like) and r (array_like)
- Returns: The computed Pseudo-Huber loss function values

### Key Documentation Points

1. **Input Domain**: The documentation does NOT specify restrictions on the valid ranges for delta or r. It simply states they are "array_like" inputs.

2. **Expected Behavior**: The documentation states:
   - It's a "smooth approximation" of the Huber loss
   - It should be continuously differentiable everywhere
   - It's convex and suitable for gradient-based optimization
   - For small |r| it behaves like squared error
   - For large |r| it behaves like absolute error

3. **Mathematical Properties**:
   - The function is described as "smooth" (continuously differentiable)
   - It's "convex" which implies it should have well-defined values everywhere in its domain
   - The Wikipedia article confirms it should have "continuous derivatives for all degrees"

4. **No Edge Case Warnings**:
   - The documentation does NOT mention any numerical issues with extreme values
   - There are NO warnings about NaN results for small delta values
   - There are NO stated restrictions on the minimum value of delta

5. **Examples in Documentation**:
   - All examples use delta values >= 1.0
   - No examples demonstrate behavior with very small delta values
   - The examples show the function should work for various combinations of delta and r

### Critical Observation
The mathematical formula δ²(√(1 + (r/δ)²) - 1) is well-defined mathematically for all positive delta and all finite r. The function should return a finite value for these inputs. The fact that it returns NaN for small delta values (< ~1e-190) is a numerical implementation issue, not a mathematical limitation.

### Conclusion
Based on the documentation, the pseudo_huber function should:
1. Accept any positive delta value
2. Return finite values for all finite inputs
3. Be smooth and continuously differentiable everywhere

The current behavior of returning NaN for small delta values violates these documented mathematical properties and expectations.
