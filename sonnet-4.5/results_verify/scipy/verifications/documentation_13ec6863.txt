## Documentation Analysis for scipy.signal.windows.tukey

### Official Documentation Review:

1. **Parameter `alpha` specification**:
   - Docstring states: "Shape parameter of the Tukey window, representing the fraction of the window inside the cosine tapered region"
   - **NO explicit range specified** in the docstring itself
   - The docstring only mentions special cases:
     - alpha = 0: equivalent to rectangular window
     - alpha = 1: equivalent to Hann window
   - The online documentation mentions "Range: 0 to 1" but this is not enforced in the code

2. **No minimum value constraint documented**:
   - The documentation does not specify a minimum valid value for alpha
   - No warnings about numerical instability for very small alpha values
   - No mention of potential NaN outputs for edge cases

3. **Implementation behavior**:
   - The code checks: `if alpha <= 0: return ones()`
   - The code checks: `if alpha >= 1.0: return hann()`
   - But NO check for extremely small positive alpha values that cause overflow

4. **Mathematical formula implications**:
   - The implementation uses division by alpha: `2.0/alpha`
   - For very small alpha (< 1e-307), this causes numerical overflow to infinity
   - The documentation does not warn about this numerical limitation

### Key Finding:
The documentation does NOT specify:
1. A minimum valid alpha value above 0
2. That extremely small alpha values may cause numerical issues
3. That the function may return NaN for certain valid inputs within the implied range

### Conclusion:
Since the documentation implies alpha can be any value between 0 and 1 (with special handling for exactly 0), but the function fails with NaN for valid floating-point numbers in this range (like 1e-308), this represents undocumented behavior that violates the reasonable expectation that the function should work for all valid floats between 0 and 1.
