Bug Reproduction Results
========================

## Test Execution

I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report. The test results confirm the exact behavior claimed:

### 1. Basic Reproduction Test
Running the provided reproduction code yields:
```
Original empty array shape: (0,)
Original non-empty array shape: (3,)

Testing with oned_as='row':
  Non-empty [1,2,3]: (3,) -> (1, 3)
  Empty []:          (0,) -> (0, 0)
  Expected empty: (1, 0), Got: (0, 0)
  Matches expectation: False

Testing with oned_as='column':
  Non-empty [1,2,3]: (3,) -> (3, 1)
  Empty []:          (0,) -> (0, 0)
  Expected empty: (0, 1), Got: (0, 0)
  Matches expectation: False
```

### 2. Hypothesis Test
The property-based test fails as expected:
- For `oned_as='row'`: Expected shape (1, 0), but got (0, 0)
- For `oned_as='column'`: Expected shape (0, 1), but got (0, 0)

### 3. Extended Testing
I tested various array shapes to understand the pattern:

**Key findings:**
- 1D non-empty arrays correctly transform based on `oned_as`:
  - shape (3,) with 'row' → (1, 3) ✓
  - shape (3,) with 'column' → (3, 1) ✓

- 1D empty arrays IGNORE the `oned_as` parameter:
  - shape (0,) with 'row' → (0, 0) ✗ (should be (1, 0))
  - shape (0,) with 'column' → (0, 0) ✗ (should be (0, 1))

- 2D arrays (both empty and non-empty) maintain their shape correctly:
  - shape (1, 0) → (1, 0) ✓
  - shape (0, 1) → (0, 1) ✓
  - shape (0, 0) → (0, 0) ✓

### 4. Technical Correctness

The bug report is technically accurate:
1. The code examples run without errors
2. The reported output matches the actual output exactly
3. The behavior is reproducible and consistent
4. The inconsistency between empty and non-empty 1D arrays is confirmed

### 5. Impact Assessment

The bug creates an inconsistency where:
- You cannot round-trip an empty row vector: save (1,0) as 'row' → load → get (0,0)
- You cannot round-trip an empty column vector: save (0,1) as 'column' → load → get (0,0)
- The `oned_as` parameter becomes meaningless for empty 1D arrays
- Code that relies on consistent shape transformations will fail for edge cases

This is a real behavioral inconsistency in the scipy library where the `oned_as` parameter is not being applied to empty 1D arrays.
