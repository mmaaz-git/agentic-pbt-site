## Triage Analysis

### Could this be a BUG?

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The implementation violates established metrology standards where relative uncertainty should use absolute value
2. The function name "precision" strongly implies a magnitude (non-negative value)
3. Returning negative precision values is counterintuitive and likely to cause issues in downstream calculations
4. The example in the documentation shows only positive values, setting user expectations
5. International standards (NIST/CODATA) define relative uncertainty as u(y)/|y|, not u(y)/y
6. 33 constants are affected, making this a significant issue

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly state precision must be non-negative
- The implementation has been this way for years without changes

### Could this be INVALID?

**Arguments FOR:**
- The documentation doesn't explicitly promise non-negative values
- The implementation correctly follows its formula (uncertainty/value)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The function violates standard metrological definitions
2. The name "precision" implies a magnitude, not a signed value
3. No reasonable interpretation of "precision" would include negative values
4. Users would reasonably expect precision to follow standard definitions

### Could this be WONTFIX?

**Arguments FOR:**
- Changing behavior might break existing code that depends on negative values
- The issue only affects 33 out of 355 constants (less than 10%)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is a correctness issue, not just a minor inconvenience
2. The fix is trivial (add abs())
3. Existing code expecting negative precision values would be relying on incorrect behavior
4. The impact on scientific calculations could be significant

### Could this be DOCUMENTATION_FIX?

**Arguments FOR:**
1. The documentation could be updated to clarify that precision can be negative
2. The documentation doesn't currently specify the behavior for negative-valued constants
3. Users could be warned about this behavior

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. Documenting incorrect behavior doesn't make it correct
2. The implementation violates standard metrological practice
3. The function name itself ("precision") implies non-negative values
4. This would perpetuate a deviation from international standards

### Could this be FEATURE_REQUEST?

**Arguments FOR:**
- Could be seen as requesting new behavior (absolute value handling)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. This is fixing incorrect behavior, not adding new functionality
2. The function should already follow standard metrological definitions
3. Users expect standard behavior based on the function name

## CONCLUSION

This is a **BUG**. The implementation clearly violates established metrological standards where relative precision/uncertainty should always be non-negative. The function name "precision" inherently implies a magnitude, and returning negative values is both counterintuitive and incorrect according to international standards (NIST/CODATA). While the documentation doesn't explicitly state precision must be non-negative, this is implied by both the function name and the universal understanding of what "precision" means in scientific contexts. The fix is trivial and would bring the implementation in line with standard practice.
