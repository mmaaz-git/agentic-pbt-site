REPRODUCTION RESULTS FOR scipy.signal.resample BUG REPORT
==========================================================

Test Environment:
-----------------
- Python version: 3.13
- Scipy version: Latest available
- NumPy version: Latest available

Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED
-------------------------------
The bug report's claims are accurate. The function crashes with the exact error described.

Test Results:
-------------

1. Hypothesis Test:
   - FAILED as reported
   - Input: data=[] (empty list)
   - Error: ValueError: invalid number of data points (0) specified
   - Location: scipy/fft/_pocketfft/basic.py line 58

2. Direct Reproduction:
   - Input: np.array([], dtype=np.float64)
   - Requested output: 10 samples
   - Result: ValueError with same error message
   - Stack trace matches exactly what was reported

3. Additional Edge Cases Tested:
   - 2D empty array (0, 2) on axis=0: Same ValueError
   - 2D empty array (2, 0) on axis=1: Same ValueError
   - All empty array inputs fail identically

4. Normal Operation Verification:
   - Non-empty array [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] resampled to 8 samples: SUCCESS
   - Output correctly generated with shape (8,)
   - Function works normally with valid input

5. Error Analysis:
   - The error occurs in the FFT implementation, not in resample itself
   - The error message "invalid number of data points (0) specified" comes from the low-level FFT routine
   - The resample function does not validate input size before calling FFT
   - The error is not caught or handled at the resample level

6. Behavior Comparison:
   - Other scipy.signal functions show varied behavior:
     * Some return empty arrays (resample_poly, fftconvolve, medfilt)
     * Some raise different errors (hilbert: "N must be positive")
     * Some raise similar reduction errors (convolve, correlate)
   - The module lacks consistent empty array handling

Technical Observations:
-----------------------
1. The crash occurs because FFT cannot operate on empty data
2. The error message is technically correct but comes from deep within the implementation
3. The function could theoretically return an array of zeros of the requested size
4. The mathematical operation of resampling empty data is undefined
5. The error could be caught and re-raised with a more informative message

Verdict on Reproduction:
The bug report accurately describes the behavior. The function does crash with a ValueError when given an empty array, and the error message comes from the FFT implementation rather than from input validation in the resample function itself.
