## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
The bug report has been successfully reproduced. The claimed documentation property for scipy.fftpack.diff does NOT hold for many zero-mean signals.

### Property-Based Test Results
The hypothesis test failed immediately with the exact example provided in the bug report:
- Input: lst=[0.0, 1.0] which produces x=[-0.5, 0.5] after mean subtraction
- Order: 1
- Result: The round-trip diff(diff(x, 1), -1) returns [0. 0.] instead of [-0.5, 0.5]

### Manual Reproduction Results
The manual test confirmed all the examples in the bug report:

1. For x = [-0.5, 0.5] (sum = 0.0):
   - diff(x, 1) = [0. 0.]
   - diff(diff(x, 1), -1) = [0. 0.]
   - Expected: [-0.5, 0.5]
   - Match: False ❌

2. For x = [1, -1, 1, -1] (sum = 0):
   - Round-trip successful: False ❌
   - Returns [0. 0. 0. 0.] instead of original

3. For x = [-1, 0, 1] (sum = 0):
   - Round-trip successful: True ✓

4. For x = [0, 1, 0, -1] (sum = 0):
   - Round-trip successful: True ✓

### Effect of the Bug
The documentation states: "If sum(x, axis=0) = 0 then diff(diff(x, k), -k) == x"

This claim is demonstrably false. The round-trip property fails for multiple zero-mean signals, including very simple cases like [-0.5, 0.5]. The property appears to work for some zero-mean signals but not others, making the documentation statement misleading and incorrect as a general claim.

The bug report accurately identifies this discrepancy between the documented behavior and actual behavior of the function.
