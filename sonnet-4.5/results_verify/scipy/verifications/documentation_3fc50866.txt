Documentation Analysis for scipy.fft.dct Type 1

Based on my comprehensive review of the scipy documentation and mathematical definitions:

1. SCIPY DOCUMENTATION:
The official scipy documentation at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fft.dct.html states:
- scipy.fft.dct computes the Discrete Cosine Transform of an input array
- Has 4 types (1, 2, 3, 4) with type=2 as default
- For DCT Type I, the documentation explicitly states: "input size must be > 1"
- This is a documented restriction specific to Type 1 DCT

2. MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION:
According to Wikipedia and mathematical references, DCT-I (Type 1 DCT) has the formula:
X_k = (1/2)(x_0 + (-1)^k * x_{N-1}) + ∑[n=1 to N-2] x_n * cos[π/(N-1) * n * k]

This formula mathematically requires N ≥ 2 because:
- It references both x_0 and x_{N-1} (first and last elements)
- The summation from n=1 to N-2 is only valid when N ≥ 2
- For N=1, the term (N-1) in the denominator would be 0, causing division by zero

The Wikipedia article explicitly states: "DCT-I is not defined for N less than 2, while all other DCT types are defined for any positive N."

3. COMPARISON WITH OTHER DCT TYPES:
- DCT Types 2, 3, and 4 ARE defined for single-element arrays
- These types have different mathematical formulations that allow N=1
- This is not an implementation limitation but a fundamental mathematical requirement

4. FFTW LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION:
The FFTW library (which scipy may use internally) also documents that REDFT00 (their DCT-I implementation) is not defined for n=1, confirming this is a standard restriction across implementations.

CONCLUSION:
The behavior reported in the bug (RuntimeError for single-element DCT-I) is CORRECT according to both scipy documentation and the mathematical definition. DCT-I fundamentally requires at least 2 elements to be mathematically meaningful. This is not a bug but expected, documented behavior.
