## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Current behavior:
The `main()` function in scipy.datasets._download_all crashes with an AttributeError when pooch is not installed, producing the error message: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'os_cache'"

### How the bug occurs:
1. When pooch is not installed, the import at the top of the file (lines 10-13) catches the ImportError and sets `pooch = None`
2. When `main()` is called, the argparse argument parser is created on line 62-65
3. Line 64 sets the default value for the path argument to `pooch.os_cache('scipy-data')`
4. Since pooch is None, this immediately causes an AttributeError when trying to call `os_cache()` on None
5. This happens during argument parser creation, before the `download_all()` function can be called

### Expected behavior:
The code should raise a clear ImportError with the message: "Missing optional dependency 'pooch' required for scipy.datasets module. Please use pip or conda to install 'pooch'."

This error message is already implemented in the `download_all()` function (lines 47-50), but it never gets reached because the crash happens earlier.

### Test results:
1. The hypothesis test from the bug report correctly identifies the issue - when pooch_installed=False, an AttributeError is raised instead of ImportError
2. The reproduction code provided in the bug report accurately demonstrates the problem
3. I verified the issue occurs both when pooch is set to None and when pooch import actually fails

The bug is real and reproducible. The premature evaluation of `pooch.os_cache()` in the argparse default value causes a crash before proper error handling can occur.
