## Bug Report Triage Analysis

### Category: BUG
**Arguments for BUG:**
- The documentation explicitly promises: "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x"
- This promise is violated for all even-length arrays, even when sum(x) == 0
- The failure is systematic and consistent, not edge-case behavior
- Users reasonably expect documented guarantees to hold
- The code behavior directly contradicts the documentation

**Arguments against BUG:**
- The documentation does mention "For even len(x), the Nyquist mode of x is taken zero"
- This could be interpreted as a warning about different behavior for even-length arrays
- The mathematical implementation may be correct for its intended use case

### Category: DOCUMENTATION_FIX
**Arguments for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- The implementation appears to be working as designed
- The Nyquist mode handling for even-length arrays is intentional
- The issue is that the documentation overpromises what the function can do
- Fixing the documentation would be simpler than changing the mathematical implementation
- The note about Nyquist mode suggests the developers knew about this limitation

**Arguments against DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
- Users may have written code relying on the documented guarantee
- The documentation makes an unqualified promise that should be honored
- Simply documenting a bug doesn't make it not a bug

### Category: WONTFIX
**Arguments for WONTFIX:**
- The Nyquist mode handling is a fundamental mathematical choice
- Changing it would break backward compatibility
- Users can work around this by using odd-length arrays
- The behavior has likely been this way for many versions

**Arguments against WONTFIX:**
- This is not an obscure edge case - it affects 50% of possible inputs (all even-length arrays)
- The documented guarantee is clear and unambiguous
- This is a core mathematical property that users would reasonably rely on

### Category: INVALID
**Arguments for INVALID:**
- The documentation does mention the Nyquist mode is taken as zero for even-length arrays

**Arguments against INVALID:**
- The bug report is factually correct - the round-trip property fails
- The code demonstrably violates its documented behavior
- The reproduction is reliable and consistent
- This is not a misunderstanding of the intended behavior

### Category: FEATURE_REQUEST
**Arguments for FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- One could argue that proper round-trip for even-length arrays is a new feature
- The current implementation may never have intended to support this

**Arguments against FEATURE_REQUEST:**
- The documentation already claims this feature exists
- This is fixing existing broken functionality, not adding new functionality
- Round-trip properties are fundamental to inverse transforms

## Conclusion

This is either a BUG (the implementation is wrong) or a DOCUMENTATION_FIX (the documentation is wrong). Given that:

1. The Nyquist mode handling appears intentional and mathematically motivated
2. Changing the implementation would be a breaking change to a numerical library
3. The documentation can be easily fixed to accurately describe the behavior
4. The note about Nyquist mode suggests awareness of this limitation

The most appropriate classification is **DOCUMENTATION_FIX**. The documentation should be updated to clarify that the round-trip property only holds for odd-length arrays, not all arrays where sum(x) == 0.
