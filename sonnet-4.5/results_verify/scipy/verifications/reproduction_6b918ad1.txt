Bug Reproduction Analysis
=========================

I successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. Test Code Execution:
   - The provided reproduction code runs correctly
   - The output matches exactly what the bug report claims

2. Observed Behavior:
   For a discontinuous piecewise constant function with values 1.0 on [0,1] and 2.0 on [1,2]:
   - Original function p(0.5) = 1.0, p(1.5) = 2.0
   - After derivative().antiderivative(): returns 0.0 everywhere
   - The difference p(x) - p'.anti(x) is 1.0 in the first piece and 2.0 in the second piece
   - This difference is NOT constant, violating the expected mathematical relationship

3. Hypothesis Test:
   - The property-based test correctly identifies the issue
   - It fails specifically for discontinuous piecewise polynomials (e.g., n_intervals=2, k=0)
   - The test expectation that p.derivative().antiderivative() should differ from p by a constant is violated

4. Further Testing:
   I tested both discontinuous and continuous piecewise polynomials:

   a) Discontinuous piecewise constant:
      - Difference between original and reconstructed: 1.0 at x=0.5, 2.0 at x=1.5
      - Difference is NOT constant across pieces

   b) Continuous piecewise polynomial (created via BSpline):
      - Difference between original and reconstructed: 0.0 everywhere
      - Difference IS constant (as expected from calculus)

Effect:
The bug causes the mathematical relationship "derivative and antiderivative are inverse operations" to fail for discontinuous piecewise polynomials. This is because the antiderivative() method enforces continuity by adjusting integration constants, which destroys the original piecewise structure when the original function was discontinuous.
