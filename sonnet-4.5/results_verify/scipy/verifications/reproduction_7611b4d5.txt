## Bug Reproduction Analysis

### Test Results

1. **Hypothesis Test**: Successfully reproduced the bug
   - The test failed with `IndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 1`
   - Error occurs when trying to use `beta0=[1.0]` (single parameter)
   - Falsifying example found with n=5

2. **Manual Test**: Confirmed the bug
   - Using `beta0=[1.0]` raises IndexError as reported
   - Traceback matches exactly what was reported in the bug
   - Error location: scipy/odr/_models.py:215 in `_unilin` function
   - Line causing error: `return x*B[0] + B[1]` where B only has one element

3. **Workaround Verification**:
   - Confirmed that using `beta0=[1.0, 0.0]` works correctly
   - Returns beta = [2.5, ~0.0] as expected for the test data
   - This confirms the model requires exactly 2 parameters

### Root Cause

The implementation of `_unilin` function at line 215 of `_models.py`:
```python
def _unilin(B, x):
    return x*B[0] + B[1]
```

This function unconditionally accesses B[1], which doesn't exist when beta0 has only one element. The model is hardcoded to expect two parameters (slope B[0] and intercept B[1]).

### Impact

The bug occurs immediately upon initializing the ODR object with a single-parameter beta0, making it impossible to use the unilinear model with what would be the intuitive single parameter usage. Users must know to provide two parameters even if they want a line through the origin.
