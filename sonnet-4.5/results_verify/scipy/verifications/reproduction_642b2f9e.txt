REPRODUCTION OF BUG REPORT

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

1. BASIC REPRODUCTION:
   - The simple test case provided in the bug report runs correctly and produces the exact output claimed:
     Input: [1. 2. 3. 4.]
     Output after ihilbert(hilbert(x)): [-1. -1.  1.  1.]
     Expected: [1. 2. 3. 4.]
     The functions do NOT produce the original input.

2. HYPOTHESIS TEST FAILURE:
   - The property-based test using Hypothesis fails immediately, confirming that the round-trip property
     ihilbert(hilbert(x)) = x does not hold for arbitrary inputs.

3. FOURIER DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
   - Confirmed that both DC component (j=0) and Nyquist frequency (j=N/2 for even N) are zeroed out:
     - Original FFT at j=0: 10+0j -> After round-trip: 0+0j
     - Original FFT at j=2 (Nyquist for N=4): -2+0j -> After round-trip: 0+0j
   - This causes information loss that makes recovery impossible.

4. EVEN VS ODD LENGTH BEHAVIOR:
   - For EVEN length arrays: Both DC and Nyquist components are zeroed, causing information loss
   - For ODD length arrays: Only DC component is zeroed (no Nyquist exists for odd lengths)
   - In ALL cases tested, ihilbert(hilbert(x)) != x

5. DOCUMENTED CONDITION TESTING:
   - The documentation states: "If sum(x, axis=0) == 0 then hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x"
   - Testing confirms this is TRUE for SOME arrays where sum=0 (specifically odd-length arrays)
   - But it FAILS for even-length arrays where sum=0 (e.g., [1, -1] or [1, -1, 1, -1])
   - Note: The bug report is about ihilbert(hilbert(x)), not hilbert(ihilbert(x))

6. KEY OBSERVATION:
   - The documentation only guarantees hilbert(ihilbert(x)) == x when sum(x)=0
   - It does NOT guarantee ihilbert(hilbert(x)) == x
   - These are different operations with different behavior

CONCLUSION:
The bug is reproducible. The functions ihilbert and hilbert do not behave as mathematical inverses
in the general case. The round-trip ihilbert(hilbert(x)) fails due to information loss at the DC
and Nyquist frequency components.
