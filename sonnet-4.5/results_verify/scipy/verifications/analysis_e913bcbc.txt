Bug Report Triage Analysis for scipy.constants.find
====================================================

Considering each possible categorization:

1. INVALID (Code works as designed, report is wrong)
   Arguments FOR:
   - The code technically works as implemented
   - It searches _current_constants as designed

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation says "physical_constant keys" not "current constant keys"
   - There's no indication this limitation is intentional
   - The function's purpose is discovery, and it fails at that for 20% of constants

   Likelihood: LOW - The bug report correctly identifies an inconsistency

2. WONTFIX (Bug exists but is trivial/uninteresting)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Users can still access the constants directly if they know the names
   - Older constants may be considered deprecated

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - 90 constants (20%) being undiscoverable is not trivial
   - These constants are still part of the public API
   - The fix is simple and non-breaking
   - Scientific users need to discover historical constant names

   Likelihood: LOW - This affects significant functionality

3. FEATURE_REQUEST (Asking for unsupported functionality)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could argue that searching old constants is a new feature
   - Maybe the design intentionally limits to current constants

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The documentation already claims this functionality exists
   - physical_constants includes these keys, so they're supported
   - This is fixing broken existing functionality, not adding new

   Likelihood: LOW - The documentation promises this already works

4. DOCUMENTATION_FIX (Documentation is wrong about behavior)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Could fix by updating docs to say "searches current CODATA constants only"
   - Would align documentation with actual behavior

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - The current documentation makes more sense from a user perspective
   - The code behavior is surprising and limiting
   - Changing the code is more beneficial than changing docs
   - The examples in docs show find() and physical_constants used together

   Likelihood: MODERATE - Possible but not the best solution

5. BUG (Valid bug that should be fixed)
   Arguments FOR:
   - Clear mismatch between documented and actual behavior
   - Function fails its stated purpose for 20% of available constants
   - Users reasonably expect find() to search all physical_constants
   - The fix is straightforward and improves functionality
   - No backwards compatibility issues with the proposed fix
   - The function name and docs imply comprehensive search

   Arguments AGAINST:
   - Could argue the current behavior is intentional (though undocumented)

   Likelihood: HIGH - This is a clear API contract violation

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
This is a BUG. The function does not behave as documented. The documentation explicitly states it returns "list of physical_constant keys" but it only searches a subset. This violates the principle of least surprise and the documented API contract. The proposed fix is correct and would make the function work as users expect based on the documentation.
