Bug Reproduction Analysis
========================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in scipy.io.matlab.savemat regarding variable names starting with digits.

Test Results:
1. Simple reproduction test:
   - Created a variable named '0test' with value np.array([1, 2, 3])
   - Called savemat() with this variable
   - Result: NO warning was raised (expected MatWriteWarning)
   - Result: Variable WAS saved to the .mat file (should have been ignored)
   - When loaded back with loadmat(), the variable '0test' was present with correct value

2. Property-based test with Hypothesis:
   - Ran test with multiple generated variable names prefixed with '0'
   - Test failed on first example: name='0A'
   - Confirmed that variables starting with digit are incorrectly saved
   - Confirmed that no MatWriteWarning is issued

The bug is confirmed: savemat() incorrectly saves variables with names starting with digits, and fails to issue the documented MatWriteWarning. This violates both the documented behavior and MATLAB's own variable naming rules.
