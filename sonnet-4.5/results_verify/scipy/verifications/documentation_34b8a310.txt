## Documentation Analysis for scipy.optimize.least_squares

### Key Documentation Findings:

1. **Termination Conditions**:
   - `ftol` (default 1e-8): Tolerance for termination by the change of the cost function. The optimization stops when dF < ftol * F, where F is the cost function.
   - `xtol` (default 1e-8): Tolerance for termination by the change of independent variables.
   - `gtol` (default 1e-8): Tolerance for termination based on the gradient norm, with method-specific criteria.

2. **Success Field**:
   - The documentation states that `success` is a boolean indicating "whether or not the optimizer exited successfully"
   - `success` is True when status > 0, meaning a termination condition was satisfied
   - The documentation does NOT specify that success requires the gradient to be near zero

3. **Optimality Field**:
   - Described as the "first-order optimality measure"
   - In unconstrained problems, it is "always the uniform norm of the gradient"
   - The documentation explicitly states this is what was compared with gtol during iterations

4. **Levenberg-Marquardt (lm) Method Specifics**:
   - Implements the algorithm from MINPACK
   - Best for unconstrained, small problems
   - Does not handle bounds
   - The documentation does not specify that all termination conditions must be met simultaneously

5. **Critical Observation**:
   - The documentation allows for termination via ANY of the three conditions (ftol, xtol, or gtol)
   - There is no requirement that the gradient norm must be small when ftol condition is satisfied
   - The `optimality` field is provided separately from `success`, suggesting they are independent measures
   - The documentation explicitly states success occurs when "one of the convergence criteria is satisfied" (not all)

### Implications for the Bug Report:
The documentation clearly indicates that the optimizer can report success=True when ANY termination condition is met, including just the ftol condition. There is no documented requirement that the gradient norm must be near zero for success to be True. The optimality field provides gradient information separately, allowing users to make their own judgment about solution quality.
