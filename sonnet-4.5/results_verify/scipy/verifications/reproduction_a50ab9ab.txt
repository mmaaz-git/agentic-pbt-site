## Reproduction Analysis for scipy.optimize.bisect Bug Report

### Bug Reproduction Results

I successfully reproduced the reported behavior:

1. **The behavior is confirmed**: When calling `bisect(f, -10.0, 7.999999999999998)` vs `bisect(f, 7.999999999999998, -10.0)` with the function f(x) = x³ - x, different roots are returned:
   - bisect(f, -10.0, 7.999999999999998) returns -1.0
   - bisect(f, 7.999999999999998, -10.0) returns 1.0000000000005667

2. **Both returned values are valid roots**:
   - f(-1.0) = 0.0 (exact)
   - f(1.0000000000005667) ≈ 1.13e-12 (very close to 0)

3. **The function has three roots in the interval**: x = -1, 0, and 1 all lie within [-10, 8] and are all valid roots of x³ - x = 0.

### Comparison with Other Methods

The bug report's claim about other methods is partially correct:
- **brentq**: Returns the same root (≈1.0) regardless of interval direction
- **brenth**: Returns the same root (≈1.0) regardless of interval direction
- **ridder**: Returns slightly different but very close roots (-1.0 vs -0.9999999999990026)

### Mathematical Context

The bisection algorithm:
1. Divides the interval in half at each iteration
2. Selects the half where the function changes sign
3. Continues until convergence

When multiple roots exist, which root is found depends on the specific sequence of midpoint calculations and interval selections. The direction of the interval (a < b vs a > b) can affect this sequence due to how the midpoint is calculated and which half is selected.

### Technical Analysis

The difference in behavior appears to be real and reproducible. The key question is whether this constitutes a bug or expected behavior given that:
1. Both returned values are valid roots
2. The documentation doesn't specify which root should be found when multiple exist
3. The documentation doesn't require deterministic behavior with respect to interval direction
