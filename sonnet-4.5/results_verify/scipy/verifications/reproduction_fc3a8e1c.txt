REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

1. Bug Report Reproduction
--------------------------
I successfully reproduced the bug as described in the report:

a) When calling scipy.differentiate.derivative with initial_step=0.0 or any negative value:
   - NO ValueError is raised (contrary to expected behavior)
   - The function returns with success=False, status=-3 (non-finite value encountered), and df=nan

b) Test results:
   - initial_step=0.0: Returns success=False, status=-3, df=nan, nfev=9, nit=1
   - initial_step=-1.0: Returns success=False, status=-3, df=nan, nfev=9, nit=1
   - initial_step=1.0 (positive): Returns success=True, status=0, df=0.5403023058667242 (correct)

2. Code Analysis
----------------
Looking at the source code (_differentiate.py):

a) Line 27: Error message states "Tolerances and step parameters must be non-negative scalars"
   - This message suggests that step parameters (including initial_step) should be validated

b) Lines 28-34: Validation is performed ONLY for step_factor, atol, and rtol
   - initial_step is NOT included in this validation array

c) Line 408: The code explicitly handles non-positive initial_step values:
   - h0 = xpx.at(h0)[h0 <= 0].set(xp.nan)
   - This sets non-positive step sizes to NaN instead of raising an error

d) This NaN then propagates through the calculation, eventually causing the algorithm to fail with status=-3 (non-finite value encountered) in the first iteration

3. Behavior Observed
--------------------
The current implementation:
- Accepts non-positive initial_step values without raising a ValueError
- Silently converts them to NaN
- Allows the computation to proceed until it fails with a cryptic status code
- This violates the principle of "fail-fast" with clear error messages

The bug report accurately describes this behavior and correctly identifies the issue.
