## Bug Reproduction Report

### Summary
I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. The scipy.differentiate.derivative function crashes with a LinAlgError when step_factor=1.0 is passed as a parameter.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **Minimal Reproduction Test**:
   - Ran the exact code from the bug report:
     ```python
     res = derivative(np.exp, 1.5, step_factor=1.0)
     ```
   - Result: LinAlgError: Singular matrix (as reported)

2. **Hypothesis Test Verification**:
   - The provided Hypothesis test correctly identifies the failing case
   - When step_factor=1.0, the test fails with LinAlgError: Singular matrix
   - Hypothesis successfully found the falsifying example with step_factor=1.0

### Technical Analysis
The bug occurs exactly as described:
1. When step_factor=1.0, the step size remains constant across iterations
2. This causes the creation of a Vandermonde matrix with repeated rows in _derivative_weights
3. The repeated rows make the matrix singular (non-invertible)
4. numpy.linalg.solve raises LinAlgError when trying to solve with a singular matrix

### Stack Trace Analysis
The error originates in:
- scipy/differentiate/_differentiate.py:682 in _derivative_weights
- Where np.linalg.solve(A, b) is called with a singular matrix A
- The error propagates up through the calculation chain

### Verification
- The bug is 100% reproducible with step_factor=1.0
- The error occurs with any valid initial_step value
- The error message matches exactly what was reported
- The root cause (singular matrix due to constant step size) aligns with the bug report's analysis
