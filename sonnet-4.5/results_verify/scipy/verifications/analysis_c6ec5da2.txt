## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The function documentation clearly states that the datasets parameter should be a callable or list/tuple of callables when not None. Passing non-callable values violates the documented contract. The fact that an error is raised (whether AssertionError or AttributeError) when invalid input is provided could be seen as correct behavior - the function is rejecting invalid input as it should. Users should not be passing non-callable values to a function that explicitly requires callables.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The bug report correctly identifies a real technical issue with using assert for input validation. The Python documentation explicitly warns against using assertions for input validation, and the behavior does change based on the -O flag, which is problematic. The error messages are indeed different and less helpful when optimization is enabled. This is a legitimate concern about code quality and consistency.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
This is an internal function (indicated by the leading underscore in _clear_cache) that is not part of the public API. Users should be using the public clear_cache() function, not accessing _clear_cache directly. The issue only affects users who are misusing the API by passing invalid inputs to an internal function. The maintainers might consider this too trivial to fix since proper usage would never encounter this issue, and the function does ultimately reject invalid input in both cases.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
Even internal functions should follow Python best practices, especially when they're imported and used by public API functions. The inconsistent behavior between normal and optimized execution is a code quality issue that affects the reliability of the library. The fix is simple and improves code quality without any downsides. Good engineering practices should be followed throughout the codebase, not just in public APIs.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state what type of error will be raised for invalid inputs, only that the parameter should be callable. The documentation could be updated to clarify that a TypeError or ValueError will be raised for non-callable inputs. This would set proper expectations about error handling without requiring code changes.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The issue is fundamentally about the implementation using assert incorrectly, not about documentation being unclear. The documentation already specifies that callables are required. The problem is that the code doesn't consistently enforce this requirement in a proper way. Adding documentation about error types wouldn't solve the underlying issue of inconsistent behavior with the -O flag.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that adding proper input validation with clear error messages is a new feature - enhanced error handling. The current code does technically work (it rejects invalid input), and the request is to make it work better with more consistent and helpful error messages. This could be seen as an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This isn't adding new functionality; it's fixing improper use of Python's assert statement. The Python documentation explicitly states that assertions shouldn't be used for input validation. This is correcting a violation of established Python best practices, not adding a new feature. The function already validates input; it just does so incorrectly.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The code violates explicit Python best practices by using assert for input validation. The Python documentation clearly states "assertions are not a substitute for proper input validation." The behavior changes based on the -O flag, creating inconsistent error handling. This is a clear violation of the principle that optimization flags shouldn't change program behavior beyond performance. The fix is straightforward and improves code reliability without any downsides.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The function ultimately rejects invalid input in both cases, just with different error messages. Users shouldn't be passing invalid inputs in the first place according to the documentation. This is an internal function (_clear_cache) that users shouldn't be calling directly. The public API (clear_cache) wraps this function and the issue only manifests when misusing the API with invalid inputs that violate the documented contract.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this issue presents a nuanced case that sits at the intersection of code quality and practical impact. The bug report is technically correct - using assert for input validation violates Python best practices and creates inconsistent behavior based on optimization flags. The Python documentation explicitly warns against this pattern, stating that assertions should not be used for input validation.

However, several mitigating factors must be considered. First, _clear_cache is an internal function (indicated by the leading underscore), not part of the public API. Users should be calling the public clear_cache() function instead. Second, the issue only manifests when users violate the documented contract by passing non-callable values where callables are explicitly required. The documentation clearly states that the datasets parameter should be callable or a list/tuple of callables.

The strongest argument for treating this as a valid bug is that Python best practices should be followed throughout a codebase, not just in public APIs. The use of assert for input validation is explicitly discouraged in Python documentation because it can be disabled with optimization flags, leading to inconsistent behavior. While the impact may be limited to edge cases of API misuse, the principle of consistent error handling and following language best practices suggests this should be addressed. The fix is simple, improves code quality, and has no downsides. Even if most users will never encounter this issue, maintaining high code quality standards throughout the library is valuable.
