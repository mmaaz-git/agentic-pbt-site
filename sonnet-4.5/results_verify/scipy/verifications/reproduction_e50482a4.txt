## Bug Reproduction Results

### Test Case Verification
I successfully reproduced the bug using the provided test case:

```python
data = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
score = 1.0
result = stats.percentileofscore(data, score, kind='rank')
```

### Results
- Returned value: 100.00000000000001
- Value > 100: True
- Value == 100: False
- Difference from 100: 1.4210854715202004e-14

### Property-Based Test
The hypothesis test failed as expected with the provided example, confirming that the function can return values exceeding 100.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs due to floating-point arithmetic in the calculation:

For kind='rank':
- The formula is: `(left + right + plus1) * (50.0 / n)`
- With the test data: `(10 + 11 + 1) * (50.0 / 11) = 22 * 4.545454545454546`
- This produces 100.00000000000001 instead of exactly 100

For kind='weak':
- The formula is: `count(a <= score) * (100.0 / n)`
- With the test data: `11 * (100.0 / 11)`
- This also produces 100.00000000000001

### Affected Modes
Testing all four modes with the same data:
- kind='rank': 100.00000000000001 (exceeds 100) ✓
- kind='weak': 100.00000000000001 (exceeds 100) ✓
- kind='strict': 90.90909090909092 (within bounds)
- kind='mean': 95.45454545454547 (within bounds)

### Mathematical Verification
The mathematical calculation should yield exactly 100:
- For 'rank': (10 + 11 + 1) * (50/11) = 22 * (50/11) = 1100/11 = 100
- For 'weak': 11 * (100/11) = 1100/11 = 100

However, due to IEEE 754 floating-point representation:
- 50.0/11 cannot be represented exactly in binary
- The multiplication accumulates this rounding error
- Result exceeds 100 by approximately 1.42e-14

### Conclusion
The bug is confirmed. The function returns values that exceed the documented range [0, 100] due to floating-point arithmetic precision issues. While the excess is extremely small (about 1.42e-14), it technically violates the documented contract that values should be in the range (0-100).
