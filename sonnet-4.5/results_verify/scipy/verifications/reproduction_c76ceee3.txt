REPRODUCTION SUMMARY
===================

Bug Reproduced: YES

The bug report is accurate. I successfully reproduced the inconsistent quote stripping behavior in scipy.io.arff.loadarff.

Test Results:
-------------

1. Hypothesis Test: FAILED
   - The property-based test failed on multiple inputs
   - Single-character attribute names with single quotes keep their quotes (e.g., 'a' -> "'a'")
   - Multi-character attribute names with single quotes have quotes stripped (e.g., 'ab' -> "ab")
   - ALL attribute names with double quotes keep their quotes (e.g., "myattr" -> '"myattr"')

2. Manual Reproduction: CONFIRMED
   Actual behavior observed:
   - Input: @attribute 'a' numeric      -> Output: "'a'" (quotes NOT stripped)
   - Input: @attribute 'ab' numeric     -> Output: "ab" (quotes stripped)
   - Input: @attribute "myattr" numeric -> Output: '"myattr"' (quotes NOT stripped)

   Expected behavior (per bug report):
   - All quotes should be stripped: 'a' -> "a", 'ab' -> "ab", "myattr" -> "myattr"

3. Data Access Impact: VERIFIED
   - Accessing data with the expected unquoted name fails
   - Users must include quotes in the field name: data['"myattr"'] instead of data['myattr']
   - This creates an awkward and inconsistent API

The bug manifests as:
- Inconsistent handling of single quotes (depends on string length)
- Complete failure to strip double quotes
- Broken data access patterns requiring users to include quotes in field names

This is a real bug affecting the usability and consistency of the ARFF parser.
