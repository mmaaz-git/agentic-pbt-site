DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS FOR scipy.ndimage.rotate

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION REVIEW:

The scipy.ndimage.rotate documentation states:
- reshape parameter (bool, optional): "If reshape is true, the output shape is adapted so that the input array is contained completely in the output. Default is True."
- When reshape=False, the output maintains the same shape as the input
- The function uses spline interpolation of the requested order

KEY FINDINGS:

1. DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT WARN ABOUT DATA LOSS:
   - No mention that reshape=False with non-square arrays can cause data loss
   - No warning that multiple rotations with reshape=False compound errors
   - No indication that rotating non-square arrays with reshape=False is problematic

2. RESHAPE PARAMETER DESCRIPTION IS INCOMPLETE:
   - The documentation only states that reshape=False keeps the same shape
   - It doesn't explain what happens when rotated content doesn't fit
   - No mention of cropping, padding, or interpolation artifacts

3. EXAMPLES ARE MISLEADING:
   - The example uses a square array (512x512), which doesn't exhibit the problem
   - No examples with non-square arrays and reshape=False
   - The visual example doesn't show the data loss issue

4. MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS NOT ADDRESSED:
   - No mention that multiple 90-degree rotations should compose properly
   - No statement about whether 4x 90° should equal 360° rotation
   - No discussion of when reshape=False is appropriate vs. problematic

5. BEHAVIOR IS TECHNICALLY "AS DOCUMENTED":
   - The function does maintain the original shape when reshape=False
   - The function does perform rotation using interpolation
   - However, the severe data loss consequence is not documented

CONCLUSION:
While the function technically behaves according to its sparse documentation (maintains shape when reshape=False), the documentation fails to warn users about the severe data loss that occurs with non-square arrays. This is a significant omission that leads to silent data corruption. The mathematical expectation that 4x 90° rotations should preserve data is reasonable and commonly assumed in image processing.
