## Documentation Analysis

### Current dice() Documentation
- The scipy.spatial.distance.dice documentation does NOT specify what should be returned for all-zero/all-False vectors
- It does NOT mention whether dice is a metric or satisfies metric properties
- The documentation only provides the mathematical formula and basic examples
- No edge cases are documented

### Comparison with jaccard() Documentation
- The jaccard function documentation explicitly states: "If u and v are both zero, their Jaccard dissimilarity is defined to be zero."
- jaccard documentation confirms it "satisfies the triangle inequality and is qualified as a metric"
- jaccard was fixed in scipy 1.2.0: "Previously, if all (positively weighted) elements in u and v are zero, the function would return nan. This was changed to return 0 instead."
- The jaccard examples explicitly show: `distance.jaccard([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]) = 0.0`

### Mathematical Background
- The Dice coefficient (Sørensen-Dice) is mathematically similar to Jaccard
- Formula: DSC = 2|X∩Y| / (|X| + |Y|) or 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)
- For a valid dissimilarity metric, d(x,x) must equal 0 (identity property)
- Returning NaN for identical vectors violates this fundamental metric property

### Documentation Verdict
The bug report's assumptions are reasonable because:
1. The function is in scipy.spatial.distance, implying it should behave as a valid distance/dissimilarity metric
2. The similar jaccard function was already fixed for this exact issue
3. The metric property d(x,x) = 0 is a fundamental requirement for dissimilarity measures
4. The documentation doesn't explicitly state that NaN is the intended behavior for all-zero vectors

The lack of documentation about this edge case doesn't make it unspecified behavior - it's a violation of basic metric properties that users can reasonably expect from a function in the distance module.
