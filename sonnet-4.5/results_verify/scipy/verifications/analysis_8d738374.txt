## INVALID Considerations
**Why it might be INVALID:**
The documentation doesn't explicitly state how empty arrays should be handled. One could argue that since empty arrays are an edge case, the current behavior of always returning (0,0) for empty 1D arrays might be intentional or undefined behavior. The documentation only mentions "1-D NumPy arrays" without specifically addressing empty arrays.

**Why it might not be INVALID:**
The documentation clearly states that the parameter applies to "1-D NumPy arrays" without any qualification or exception. An empty array with shape (0,) is still a valid 1D NumPy array. The function works correctly for non-empty 1D arrays, establishing a clear pattern that should logically extend to empty arrays. The inconsistency is not a matter of undefined behavior but a clear deviation from the established pattern.

## WONTFIX Considerations
**Why it might be WONTFIX:**
Empty arrays are edge cases that may rarely occur in practice. The impact might be considered minimal since most users work with non-empty data. Changing this behavior could potentially break existing code that relies on the current (0,0) shape for empty arrays. The workaround is simple - users can manually reshape empty arrays if needed.

**Why it might not be WONTFIX:**
This is not just a trivial edge case but a fundamental inconsistency in the API. The issue affects data serialization and interoperability with MATLAB, where maintaining correct dimensions is important. The fix would make the behavior consistent and predictable. Empty arrays do occur in real applications, especially in data processing pipelines where filters might produce empty results.

## DOCUMENTATION_FIX Considerations
**Why it might be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
If the current behavior is intentional, the documentation should explicitly state that empty 1D arrays are always saved as (0,0) regardless of the oned_as parameter. This would clarify the expected behavior and prevent confusion. The documentation could be updated to mention this special case.

**Why it might not be DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
The current behavior appears to be a bug rather than an intentional design choice. There's no logical reason why empty arrays should be treated differently from non-empty ones in this context. Documenting a bug doesn't fix the underlying inconsistency. The pattern established by non-empty arrays strongly suggests the current behavior is incorrect, not just poorly documented.

## FEATURE_REQUEST Considerations
**Why it might be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
One could argue that proper handling of empty 1D arrays with oned_as is a new feature that wasn't originally implemented. The current implementation might have never considered this case, and adding support for it would be an enhancement rather than a fix.

**Why it might not be FEATURE_REQUEST:**
This is not asking for new functionality but for existing functionality to work consistently. The oned_as parameter already exists and has clear semantics - it should apply to all 1D arrays, not just non-empty ones. The request is to fix inconsistent behavior, not to add a new feature.

## BUG Considerations
**Why it might be BUG:**
The behavior is clearly inconsistent - the oned_as parameter works correctly for non-empty 1D arrays but is completely ignored for empty 1D arrays. The documentation makes no distinction between empty and non-empty arrays. The mathematical transformation pattern (adding a dimension of size 1) should apply uniformly. This inconsistency breaks the principle of least surprise and can cause issues in code that expects consistent behavior. The fix is straightforward and would make the API more predictable.

**Why it might not be BUG:**
The only argument against it being a bug would be if this was intentional behavior, but there's no evidence for that in the documentation or logic. Empty matrices in MATLAB can have shapes like (1,0) or (0,1), so there's no technical limitation preventing correct behavior.

## Overall Consideration

After careful analysis, this appears to be a legitimate bug in scipy.io.matlab.savemat. The evidence is compelling:

First, the documentation explicitly states that the oned_as parameter controls how "1-D NumPy arrays" are written, with no exceptions mentioned for empty arrays. An empty array with shape (0,) is unquestionably a 1D NumPy array, so the parameter should apply to it. The current behavior where empty 1D arrays always become (0,0) regardless of the oned_as setting directly contradicts the documented purpose of this parameter.

Second, there's a clear, consistent pattern for non-empty arrays: when oned_as='row', a 1D array gets a new first dimension of size 1 (e.g., (3,) → (1,3)); when oned_as='column', it gets a new second dimension of size 1 (e.g., (3,) → (3,1)). This same transformation should logically apply to empty arrays: (0,) → (1,0) for row, and (0,) → (0,1) for column. The current behavior breaks this pattern without any documented reason.

Third, this is not merely a theoretical issue. MATLAB does support empty matrices with shapes (1,0) and (0,1), and these shapes have semantic meaning - they represent empty row and column vectors respectively. The inability to correctly save and load these shapes breaks interoperability with MATLAB and prevents proper round-tripping of data. This is precisely the kind of issue that the oned_as parameter was designed to address, making its failure for empty arrays a clear bug rather than a missing feature or documentation issue.
