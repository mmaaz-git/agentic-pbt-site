## Bug Reproduction Results

### Bug Report Claims
The bug report claims that when an array has constant values, `np.std()` may return a very small non-zero value (e.g., 5.82e-11) due to floating-point precision, causing the whiten function to produce astronomically large incorrect values instead of preserving the constant values.

### Reproduction Confirmed
I successfully reproduced the exact behavior described in the bug report:

1. **Input**: Array with all values = 93206.82233024, shape (40, 2)
2. **Standard Deviation**: numpy computed 5.82076609e-11 for both columns
3. **Exact Equality Check**: std_dev == 0 returned [False, False]
4. **Output**: 1.60128101e+15 (instead of the original 93206.82233024)
5. **Multiplication Factor**: Exactly 17179869184.0 (which is 2^34)

### Technical Analysis
The issue is confirmed to be a floating-point precision problem:
- When creating arrays with large constant values, numpy's std() function returns a tiny non-zero value
- This happens consistently with different array creation methods (list multiplication, np.full, np.ones * value)
- The exact same pattern with value 93206.82233024 always produces std = 5.82076609e-11
- Smaller values show similar behavior but with different tiny std values

### Comparison with Expected Behavior
- **Small constant values (e.g., 1.0)**: std() returns exactly 0.0, warning is shown, values unchanged ✓
- **Large constant values (e.g., 93206.82233024)**: std() returns ~5.82e-11, no warning, values multiplied by 2^34 ✗
- **Medium values created with np.ones * 42**: std() returns exactly 0.0, warning shown, values unchanged ✓

### The Core Issue
The function promises that "columns with standard deviation zero...will not change" but:
1. It only detects zero std using exact equality (std_dev == 0)
2. Floating-point precision causes constant columns to have tiny non-zero std values
3. This causes division by the tiny std, producing incorrect gigantic values

### Mathematical Verification
The output value can be calculated as:
- Input: 93206.82233024
- Computed std: 5.82076609e-11
- Division: 93206.82233024 / 5.82076609e-11 = 1.60128101e+15
- This matches the observed output exactly

The bug report is technically accurate in its description of the problem and the reproduction case demonstrates the exact issue described.
