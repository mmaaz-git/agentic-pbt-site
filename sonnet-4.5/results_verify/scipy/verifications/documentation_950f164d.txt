DOCUMENTATION REVIEW FOR scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.transpose() and has_canonical_format flag

## Official Documentation Findings:

### has_canonical_format Attribute:
From the scipy documentation and source code docstrings, "canonical format" for COO matrices means:
1. Entries and coordinates are sorted by row, then column
2. There are no duplicate entries (i.e., no duplicate (i,j) locations)
3. Data arrays MAY have explicit zeros

This is stated explicitly in the coo_matrix docstring (lines 1420-1423 and 1534-1537 in _coo.py):
"Canonical format
    - Entries and coordinates sorted by row, then column.
    - There are no duplicate entries (i.e. duplicate (i,j) locations)
    - Data arrays MAY have explicit zeros."

### transpose() Method:
The transpose() method documentation (inherited from _spbase.transpose) states:
"Reverses the dimensions of the sparse array/matrix."

The implementation (lines 227-244 in _coo.py) shows that:
- It permutes the shape and coordinates according to the axes
- Creates a new COO matrix with the transposed coordinates
- The constructor called on line 242-243 with (data, permuted_coords) format ALWAYS sets has_canonical_format = False (as seen on line 63)

### Key Observations:
1. When a COO matrix is created from (data, coords) tuple format, the constructor automatically sets has_canonical_format = False (line 63)
2. The transpose() method doesn't have any documentation stating whether it preserves the canonical format flag
3. The sum_duplicates() method explicitly sets has_canonical_format = True after ensuring no duplicates exist (line 536)
4. Several other methods check and rely on the has_canonical_format flag for optimization purposes

### Documentation Gaps:
The documentation does NOT specify:
- Whether transpose() should preserve the canonical format flag
- What the expected behavior is for structure-preserving operations like transpose
- Whether the canonical format flag is meant to be preserved across operations that cannot introduce duplicates

### Mathematical Correctness:
From a mathematical perspective, transposing a matrix:
- Swaps rows and columns (i,j) -> (j,i)
- Cannot introduce duplicate entries if none existed before
- If the original matrix had unique (i,j) pairs, the transposed matrix will have unique (j,i) pairs
- The sorting order may change (sorted by row then column becomes sorted by what was column then row)

The bug report's claim that "transpose is a structure-preserving operation" regarding duplicates is mathematically correct - transposition cannot create duplicate entries from a matrix without duplicates.
