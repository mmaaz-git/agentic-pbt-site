## Bug Triage Analysis

### Considering BUG (Valid Bug Report)

**Arguments FOR classifying as BUG:**
1. The module docstring explicitly promises "lossless serialization of non-standard JSON types"
2. Silent data loss occurs without warning - microseconds are truncated to zero
3. The documentation lists datetime as a supported type without mentioning limitations
4. Users have reasonable expectations that datetime objects should round-trip perfectly
5. The fix is straightforward - use ISO 8601 format instead of RFC 2822
6. Real-world impact on applications requiring sub-second precision

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The underlying Werkzeug functions work correctly according to RFC 2822
2. HTTP date headers traditionally use RFC 2822 format

### Considering INVALID

**Arguments FOR classifying as INVALID:**
1. The code is using HTTP date format, which by RFC 2822 specification doesn't support microseconds
2. The implementation correctly follows the HTTP date standard

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation promises "lossless" serialization
2. There's no indication that datetime serialization would lose precision
3. Silent data loss is generally considered a bug

### Considering WONTFIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as WONTFIX:**
1. Microsecond precision in session cookies might be considered obscure
2. Most web applications don't need sub-second precision in sessions

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The fix is simple and doesn't break backward compatibility for reading
2. Data loss bugs are generally not considered "wontfix" material
3. Modern applications increasingly need microsecond precision

### Considering DOCUMENTATION_FIX

**Arguments FOR classifying as DOCUMENTATION_FIX:**
1. The code works as designed using standard HTTP date format
2. Could argue the documentation should mention the precision limitation

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation explicitly promises "lossless" serialization
2. Simply documenting data loss doesn't make it acceptable
3. A better technical solution exists (ISO 8601)

### Considering FEATURE_REQUEST

**Arguments FOR classifying as FEATURE_REQUEST:**
1. Could argue that microsecond support is a new feature, not a bug

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. The documentation already claims to support datetime objects
2. Round-trip property is a fundamental expectation of serializers
3. This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new functionality

### Conclusion

This should be classified as **BUG** because:
1. The documentation explicitly promises "lossless serialization"
2. Datetime is listed as a supported type without caveats
3. Silent data loss violates the principle of least surprise
4. The serializer fails the basic round-trip property test
5. A simple fix exists that maintains backward compatibility
