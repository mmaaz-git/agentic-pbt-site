## Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report. Here are my findings:

### Hypothesis Test Reproduction
The provided Hypothesis test fails exactly as described:
- When called with built-in modules like 'sys', 'builtins', or 'marshal'
- The function raises a RuntimeError with the message: "No root path can be found for the provided module 'sys'..."
- The test expects the function to return a string (any string), but instead it raises an exception

### Manual Test Reproduction
I ran two test cases to understand the behavior:

1. **Built-in module ('sys')**:
   - Result: Raises RuntimeError
   - Message: "No root path can be found for the provided module 'sys'. This can happen because the module came from an import hook that does not provide file name information or because it's a namespace package. In this case the root path needs to be explicitly provided."

2. **Non-existent module ('this_module_does_not_exist_1234567890')**:
   - Result: Returns the current working directory ('/home/npc/pbt/agentic-pbt/envs/flask_env')
   - No exception raised

### Key Observation
The function exhibits inconsistent behavior:
- For modules that don't exist at all, it returns os.getcwd() (current working directory)
- For built-in modules that exist but have no __file__ attribute, it raises RuntimeError

This confirms the bug report's claim that there is an inconsistency in how the function handles different types of modules where a root path cannot be determined.
