## Bug Triage Analysis

### Consideration for BUG:
**Strong Arguments:**
1. The current behavior is unexpected and error-prone - values like " false " are treated as True
2. This can cause real production issues when environment variables have accidental whitespace
3. The fix is simple and backward-compatible (stripping whitespace is more permissive, not restrictive)
4. Most users would expect robust parsing that ignores surrounding whitespace
5. The bug report provides clear reproduction steps and a reasonable fix

**This appears to be a valid BUG because:**
- The functions fail to handle a common real-world scenario
- The behavior violates the principle of least surprise
- It can lead to incorrect configuration in production

### Consideration for WONTFIX:
**Weak Arguments:**
1. Python's own `strtobool` doesn't strip whitespace either
2. The documentation doesn't promise whitespace handling
3. Users should ensure clean environment variables

**Not WONTFIX because:**
- Just because Python's strtobool has this issue doesn't mean Flask should
- The impact is significant enough to warrant fixing
- This is not an obscure edge case but a common scenario

### Consideration for INVALID:
**Weak Arguments:**
1. The code works as designed - it checks exact string matches
2. Documentation doesn't specify whitespace should be trimmed
3. Users who provide " false " are technically providing a different value

**Not INVALID because:**
- The bug report correctly identifies unexpected behavior
- The current behavior is problematic even if technically "correct"
- The issue represents a real problem users face

### Consideration for FEATURE_REQUEST:
**Some Arguments:**
1. The current code doesn't handle whitespace, so adding this could be seen as a new feature
2. The documentation doesn't promise this behavior

**Not purely FEATURE_REQUEST because:**
- This is more about fixing unexpected behavior than adding new functionality
- The functions already attempt to parse boolean-like values, they just do it incompletely
- This is a bug in the robustness of existing functionality

### Consideration for DOCUMENTATION_FIX:
**Weak Arguments:**
1. We could document that whitespace is not trimmed
2. Users should be aware of this limitation

**Not DOCUMENTATION_FIX because:**
- Documenting bad behavior doesn't make it good
- The better solution is to fix the code, not document the quirk
- Users expect robust parsing

## Final Assessment

This is a **BUG** that should be fixed. The functions fail to robustly parse environment variables in common real-world scenarios where whitespace might be present. The current behavior:

1. Violates user expectations
2. Can cause production configuration errors
3. Is easily fixable without breaking backward compatibility
4. Represents incomplete implementation of boolean-like value parsing

The proposed fix (adding `.strip()` before `.lower()`) is:
- Simple and clean
- Backward compatible (more permissive, not restrictive)
- Follows best practices for robust configuration parsing
- Aligns with user expectations

While the documentation doesn't explicitly promise whitespace handling, the functions are clearly intended to parse boolean-like values from environment variables, and doing so robustly includes handling common formatting variations like surrounding whitespace.
