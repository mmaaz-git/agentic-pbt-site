# Documentation Analysis

## flask.json.dumps() Documentation

From the Flask source code (flask/json/__init__.py), the function's docstring states:

```
"""Serialize data as JSON.

If :data:`~flask.current_app` is available, it will use its
:meth:`app.json.dumps() <flask.json.provider.JSONProvider.dumps>`
method, otherwise it will use :func:`json.dumps`.

:param obj: The data to serialize.
:param kwargs: Arguments passed to the ``dumps`` implementation.
```

## Key Documentation Points

1. **Explicitly documented behavior**: The documentation EXPLICITLY states that the behavior differs based on whether `current_app` is available:
   - With app context: Uses `current_app.json.dumps()`
   - Without app context: Uses standard `json.dumps()`

2. **DefaultJSONProvider behavior**: The DefaultJSONProvider class (used when app context is active) has `sort_keys = True` as a class attribute (line 150-154 of provider.py), documented as:
   ```
   """Sort the keys in any serialized dicts. This may be useful for
   some caching situations, but can be disabled for better performance.
   When enabled, keys must all be strings, they are not converted
   before sorting."""
   ```

3. **Inconsistency in defaults**: When no app context is active, the code only sets the `default` parameter and does NOT set `sort_keys`, leading to different behavior.

## Documentation Gaps

1. The documentation does NOT explicitly mention that the output format may differ (sorted vs unsorted keys) depending on context.
2. Users would not expect that the same function call would produce different JSON strings for the same input based on context.
3. The documentation mentions that different implementations are used but does not warn about behavioral differences in the output.

## Conclusion

While the documentation mentions that different code paths are taken based on context, it does NOT document that this leads to different serialization behavior (sorted vs unsorted keys). This is a documentation gap at minimum, and arguably a behavioral inconsistency that violates the principle of least surprise.
