## Bug Reproduction Analysis

I have successfully reproduced the bug described in the report.

### Hypothesis Test Results

The property-based test using Hypothesis failed immediately with a naive datetime:
- Failing input: `datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0)`
- The test correctly asserts that `deserialized == dt` should hold for roundtrip serialization
- The test fails because the deserialized datetime has UTC timezone while the original was naive

### Manual Reproduction Results

The manual test confirmed the exact behavior described in the bug report:
- Original datetime: `datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0)` with tzinfo=None (naive)
- Serialized form: `'{" d":"Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT"}'` (HTTP date format)
- Deserialized datetime: `datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)` with tzinfo=UTC
- Equality check: False

### Key Observations

1. The serialization process converts the datetime to an HTTP date string format using RFC 2822 format
2. The HTTP date format always represents times in GMT/UTC
3. During deserialization, the parser adds UTC timezone information to the datetime object
4. This transforms a naive datetime into a timezone-aware datetime, breaking the roundtrip property

### Effect

The effect is that any naive datetime serialized through TaggedJSONSerializer will be deserialized as a timezone-aware datetime with UTC timezone. This means:
- The roundtrip property is broken: serialize(deserialize(x)) != x for naive datetimes
- Applications relying on naive datetimes (e.g., for local times without timezone context) will get different objects back
- Equality comparisons will fail between original and deserialized datetimes
- This could cause subtle bugs in session handling or any other code using TaggedJSONSerializer for datetime storage
