REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I have successfully reproduced the bug reported in Flask's Config.from_prefixed_env method.

## Bug Confirmation

The bug occurs exactly as described in the report:

1. When setting environment variables:
   - `FLASK_DB = json.dumps("sqlite")`
   - `FLASK_DB__NAME = json.dumps("mydb")`

2. Calling `config.from_prefixed_env(prefix="FLASK")` results in:
   ```
   TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
   ```

## Root Cause

The issue is in lines 176-183 of flask/config.py. When processing environment variables in sorted order:

1. `FLASK_DB` is processed first (alphabetically before `FLASK_DB__NAME`)
2. It sets `config['DB'] = "sqlite"` (a string value)
3. Then `FLASK_DB__NAME` is processed
4. The code tries to traverse `DB` as a dictionary with `current = current[part]` (line 181)
5. Since `current['DB']` is a string, not a dict, line 183 crashes when trying `current[tail] = value`

## Code Analysis

The problematic code section:
```python
for part in parts:
    # If an intermediate dict does not exist, create it.
    if part not in current:
        current[part] = {}

    current = current[part]  # Assumes current[part] is a dict

current[tail] = value  # Crashes if current is not a dict
```

The code checks if a key doesn't exist and creates a dict, but it doesn't handle the case where the key exists but contains a non-dict value.

## Impact

This bug makes it impossible to use both simple and nested configuration keys that share a prefix when using from_prefixed_env. This is a legitimate use case that violates user expectations based on the documentation.

The bug is reproducible and affects real-world usage patterns where users might have both:
- A simple database connection string: `FLASK_DB="sqlite://..."`
- And nested database configuration: `FLASK_DB__NAME="mydb"`, `FLASK_DB__HOST="localhost"`
