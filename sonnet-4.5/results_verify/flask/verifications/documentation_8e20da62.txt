## Documentation Analysis

### Flask TaggedJSONSerializer Documentation

From the source code docstring in `/flask/json/tag.py`:
```
"""Serializer that uses a tag system to compactly represent objects that
are not JSON types. Passed as the intermediate serializer to
:class:`itsdangerous.Serializer`.

The following extra types are supported:

* :class:`dict`
* :class:`tuple`
* :class:`bytes`
* :class:`~markupsafe.Markup`
* :class:`~uuid.UUID`
* :class:`~datetime.datetime`
```

Key observations:
1. The documentation claims to support `datetime.datetime` objects
2. No mention of precision limitations or microsecond loss
3. No warning about the serialization not being lossless for datetimes
4. The module docstring states it provides "lossless serialization of non-standard JSON types"

### RFC 2822 Date Format Specification

Based on RFC 2822 and related standards research:
1. RFC 2822 defines date-time format as: "day-name, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT"
2. Time precision is limited to seconds (HH:MM:SS format)
3. No support for fractional seconds or microseconds
4. This is a deliberate design choice in the RFC, not an oversight

### Werkzeug HTTP Date Functions

The Werkzeug `http_date()` and `parse_date()` functions:
1. Follow RFC 2822 format for HTTP date headers
2. Correctly implement the RFC specification
3. Cannot preserve microseconds as the format doesn't support them

### Documentation Gap

The critical documentation issue is:
1. Flask's TaggedJSONSerializer documentation claims "lossless serialization"
2. It lists datetime as a supported type without caveats
3. No mention that datetime serialization loses sub-second precision
4. Users would reasonably expect datetime objects to round-trip perfectly

### Conclusion

The documentation is misleading. It promises "lossless serialization" and lists datetime as supported, but doesn't mention the significant limitation that microseconds are lost. This violates user expectations set by the documentation.
