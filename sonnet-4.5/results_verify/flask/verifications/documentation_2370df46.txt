DOCUMENTATION REVIEW
====================

## Official Flask Documentation Analysis

I reviewed the official Flask documentation for the `Config.from_prefixed_env` method from multiple sources:

### 1. Source Code Documentation (Docstring)
From flask/config.py lines 129-151:
- States that environment variables starting with the prefix are loaded
- Keys are loaded in sorted order
- Values are parsed through a loading function (default: json.loads)
- Nested dicts can be set by separating keys with double underscores (`__`)
- "If an intermediate key doesn't exist, it will be initialized to an empty dict"

### 2. Flask Configuration Guide
From https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/config/:
- Confirms the double underscore mechanism for nested configuration
- Provides example: FLASK_MYAPI__credentials__username creates nested structure
- States that "intermediate keys are automatically initialized as empty dictionaries if they don't exist"

### 3. What the Documentation DOES NOT Say

Critically, the documentation **does not specify** what should happen when:
1. The same key is used for both a flat value and as a parent for nested values
2. There is a conflict between FLASK_KEY=value and FLASK_KEY__SUBKEY=value
3. A key already exists with a non-dict value when trying to create nested structure

The documentation only addresses the case where "an intermediate key doesn't exist" - it says nothing about what happens when the intermediate key DOES exist but contains a non-dict value.

## Documentation Implications

The documentation's silence on this conflict scenario means:
1. The current behavior (crashing with TypeError) is **undocumented behavior**
2. Users have no guidance on how to avoid or handle such conflicts
3. The error message doesn't help users understand what went wrong

## Conclusion

The bug represents a gap between the documented behavior and the actual implementation. The documentation implies that nested configuration "just works" but doesn't warn about or specify behavior for conflicting definitions. This is neither explicitly allowed nor forbidden by the documentation, making this an undocumented edge case that results in a confusing crash.
