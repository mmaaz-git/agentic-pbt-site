=== Bug Reproduction Analysis ===

The bug described in the report has been successfully reproduced.

## Reproduction Method

1. I ran the provided Hypothesis test which immediately failed on the first example:
   - Setting FLASK_DEBUG=" false " (with leading and trailing spaces) returns True instead of False
   - The test expected False but got True, confirming the bug

2. I ran the manual reproduction code from the bug report and confirmed:
   - get_debug_flag() returns True for " false ", " 0 ", and " no " (should return False)
   - get_load_dotenv() returns False for " false ", " 0 ", and " no " (should return True)

3. Control tests show that without whitespace, the functions work correctly:
   - FLASK_DEBUG="false" correctly returns False
   - FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV="false" correctly returns True

## Technical Analysis

The bug is in the implementation of both functions in flask/helpers.py:

1. get_debug_flag() (line 28-33):
   - Gets the value from os.environ.get("FLASK_DEBUG")
   - Checks if val.lower() is NOT in {"0", "false", "no"}
   - But does NOT strip whitespace before comparison
   - So " false " doesn't match "false" and is treated as truthy

2. get_load_dotenv() (line 36-48):
   - Gets the value from os.environ.get("FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV")
   - Checks if val.lower() IS in {"0", "false", "no"}
   - But does NOT strip whitespace before comparison
   - So " false " doesn't match "false" and returns False instead of True

## Impact

The bug causes unexpected behavior when environment variables have surrounding whitespace:
- Debug mode may be accidentally enabled in production if FLASK_DEBUG=" false "
- Dotenv loading may be incorrectly skipped if FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV=" false "

This is a real issue because whitespace can easily be introduced through:
- Shell scripts with quoting issues
- .env files with formatting
- Copy-paste errors
- Configuration management systems

The bug is confirmed and reproducible.
