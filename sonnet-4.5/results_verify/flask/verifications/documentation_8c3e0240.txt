## Documentation Analysis for flask.helpers.get_root_path

### Official Docstring (from source code)
The function's docstring states:
```
Find the root path of a package, or the path that contains a module.
If it cannot be found, returns the current working directory.
```

This is a clear, unambiguous statement that establishes the function's contract:
1. Primary purpose: Find the root path of a package or module
2. Fallback behavior: **"If it cannot be found, returns the current working directory"**

### Actual Implementation Behavior
After examining the source code (flask/helpers.py lines 570-624), the function's actual behavior is:

1. First checks if module is already imported and has a __file__ attribute
2. If not, tries to find the module spec using importlib.util.find_spec
3. If the loader is None (module doesn't exist), returns os.getcwd()
4. If loader exists but has no get_filename method, falls back to importing the module
5. After importing, gets the __file__ attribute from the module
6. **If __file__ is None (e.g., for built-in modules), raises RuntimeError**

### The Contradiction
The docstring promises: "If it cannot be found, returns the current working directory"

However, the implementation contains this code (lines 613-621):
```python
if filepath is None:
    raise RuntimeError(
        "No root path can be found for the provided module"
        f" {import_name!r}. This can happen because the module"
        " came from an import hook that does not provide file"
        " name information or because it's a namespace package."
        " In this case the root path needs to be explicitly"
        " provided."
    )
```

### Inconsistent Behavior
- For non-existent modules: Returns os.getcwd() (matches docstring)
- For built-in modules without __file__: Raises RuntimeError (violates docstring)

### Conclusion
The docstring establishes a clear contract that the function should ALWAYS return a string - either the root path or the current working directory as a fallback. The RuntimeError for built-in modules directly violates this documented contract. Users relying on the documented behavior would not expect the function to raise an exception.
