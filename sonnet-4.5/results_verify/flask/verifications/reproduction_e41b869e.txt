# Bug Reproduction Analysis

## Hypothesis Test Results

The provided Hypothesis test successfully reproduces the bug. When run, it immediately fails with a simple counter-example:
- Input dict: `{'0': 0, '': 0}`
- Without app context: `{"0": 0, "": 0}` (maintains insertion order)
- With app context: `{"": 0, "0": 0}` (sorts keys alphabetically, where empty string comes before "0")

The test correctly demonstrates that the same dictionary produces different JSON strings depending on whether an app context is active.

## Manual Test Results

The manual reproduction case also confirms the bug:
- Input dict: `{'z': 1, 'a': 2, 'b': 3}`
- Without app context: `{"z": 1, "a": 2, "b": 3}` (maintains insertion order)
- With app context: `{"a": 2, "b": 3, "z": 1}` (sorts keys alphabetically)

## Bug Confirmation

Both tests confirm that:
1. `flask.json.dumps()` behaves differently based on whether an app context is active
2. Without an app context, dictionary keys maintain their insertion order
3. With an app context, dictionary keys are sorted alphabetically
4. The same input produces different output strings, which could cause issues in scenarios where consistent serialization is expected

The bug report is accurate in its description of the problem and the provided test cases correctly demonstrate the inconsistent behavior.
