## Documentation Analysis

### Flask TaggedJSONSerializer Documentation

The TaggedJSONSerializer is documented in the source code (flask/json/tag.py) with the following key statement:

**Line 5**: "A compact representation for lossless serialization of non-standard JSON types."

This explicitly claims "lossless serialization" as a core feature.

### Class Documentation

The TaggedJSONSerializer class documentation (lines 220-232) states:
- "Serializer that uses a tag system to compactly represent objects that are not JSON types"
- Lists supported types including `datetime.datetime`
- No mention of any limitations or special handling for naive vs timezone-aware datetimes

### DateTime Handling Implementation

The TagDateTime class (lines 205-217) uses:
1. `http_date()` from Werkzeug for serialization (line 213)
2. `parse_date()` from Werkzeug for deserialization (line 216)

### Werkzeug Function Behavior

Based on the Werkzeug function documentation:

**http_date()**:
- "assumes naive datetime objects are in UTC instead of raising an exception"
- Formats datetime to RFC 2822 date string

**parse_date()**:
- "always returns a timezone-aware datetime object"
- "If the string doesn't have timezone information, it is assumed to be UTC"
- Changed in Werkzeug 2.0 to "Return a timezone-aware datetime object"

### Critical Documentation Finding

The parse_date function documentation explicitly states it "always returns a timezone-aware datetime object." This means the current implementation CANNOT maintain lossless serialization for naive datetimes by design.

### GitHub Issues Found

From web search, I found issue #4466 on pallets/flask GitHub: "TaggedJSONSerializer doesn't round-trip naive datetimes" - indicating this is a known issue.

### Documentation vs Implementation Mismatch

The documentation claims "lossless serialization" (line 5) but:
1. The implementation uses functions that explicitly change timezone information
2. Werkzeug's parse_date was changed in version 2.0 to ALWAYS return timezone-aware datetimes
3. This breaks the "lossless" contract for naive datetime objects

### No Warning or Documentation About Limitation

The Flask documentation does not:
- Warn users about this limitation with naive datetimes
- Document that datetimes will be converted to UTC timezone-aware
- Provide guidance on handling naive datetimes differently

The documentation's claim of "lossless serialization" is incorrect for naive datetime objects given the current implementation.
