DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Flask Documentation for send_from_directory

From Flask's built-in documentation (help(send_from_directory)):

The function is documented as:
- "Send a file from within a directory using send_file"
- "This is a secure way to serve files from a folder, such as static files or uploads"
- "Uses safe_join to ensure the path coming from the client is not maliciously crafted to point outside the specified directory"

Key points from the documentation:
1. The function is advertised as "secure"
2. It performs security checks via safe_join
3. It raises 404 NotFound if the file doesn't exist
4. No mention of limitations regarding newline characters in filenames
5. No warning about potential crashes with certain valid filesystem filenames

## HTTP Specification Requirements

Based on RFC 7230, RFC 2616, and RFC 9112:

1. **Header Field Values MUST NOT contain newline characters**:
   - HTTP header values cannot contain bare CR (\r) or LF (\n) characters
   - The only allowed use of CRLF is as line terminators between headers
   - "No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence" (RFC 2616)

2. **This is a fundamental HTTP requirement**:
   - Not specific to Flask or Python
   - Required by the HTTP protocol itself
   - Violating this causes protocol-level errors

## Critical Documentation Gap

The Flask documentation DOES NOT mention that:
1. Filenames containing newline characters will cause crashes
2. There's a mismatch between what the filesystem allows and what HTTP headers allow
3. The "secure" designation only refers to path traversal, not HTTP header safety

## Werkzeug's Role

Flask delegates to Werkzeug's send_from_directory, which in turn uses send_file. The error originates from Werkzeug's header validation, which correctly enforces the HTTP specification by rejecting newline characters in header values.

## Conclusion on Documentation

The documentation is incomplete. While the function correctly implements HTTP specifications by rejecting newline characters in headers, this limitation is not documented in Flask's API reference. Users could reasonably expect that any filesystem-valid filename would work, especially since:
1. The function is described as "secure"
2. Security checks (safe_join) pass for these filenames
3. No warnings exist about this limitation
