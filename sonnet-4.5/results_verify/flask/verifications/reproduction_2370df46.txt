REPRODUCTION ANALYSIS
=====================

I successfully reproduced the bug reported in the Flask Config.from_prefixed_env method. The bug occurs exactly as described when environment variables define both a flat key and a nested key with the same prefix.

## Reproduction Steps Performed

1. **Property-based test**: Created and attempted to run the hypothesis test from the bug report. The test correctly identifies the issue.

2. **Direct reproduction**: Ran multiple test cases that confirm the bug:

   Test Case 1 - Exact example from bug report:
   - Set: FLASK_DATABASE="123" and FLASK_DATABASE__HOST="localhost"
   - Result: TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment

   Test Case 2 - Minimal failing case:
   - Set: FLASK_A="0" and FLASK_A__SUBKEY="0"
   - Result: TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment

   Test Case 3 - Order independence:
   - Set: FLASK_B__SUBKEY="value" and FLASK_B="123" (reverse order)
   - Result: TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment

   Test Case 4 - String values:
   - Set: FLASK_C="not_a_number" and FLASK_C__SUBKEY="value"
   - Result: TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the Flask source code (config.py lines 154-183), the bug occurs because:

1. Environment variables are processed in sorted alphabetical order (line 154)
2. When FLASK_DATABASE is encountered first, it's parsed as JSON and stored as integer 123 (lines 161-169)
3. When FLASK_DATABASE__HOST is processed next, the code attempts to traverse nested dicts (lines 173-183)
4. At line 181, the code tries to execute `current = current[part]` where current[part] is the integer 123
5. At line 183, it tries `current[tail] = value` which fails with TypeError because current is an integer, not a dict

## Bug Confirmation

The bug is confirmed and reproducible. The error occurs consistently when:
- An environment variable sets a flat configuration value
- Another environment variable tries to set a nested value under the same key
- The flat variable is processed first (alphabetically)

The current implementation does not handle this conflict gracefully and crashes with an uninformative error message that doesn't indicate the actual problem (conflicting environment variable definitions).
