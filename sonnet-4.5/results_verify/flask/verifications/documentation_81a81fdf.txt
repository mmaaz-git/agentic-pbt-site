DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
======================

## Method Documentation (from docstring)

The `from_prefixed_env` method's docstring states:

1. "Keys are loaded in :func:`sorted` order."
2. "Specific items in nested dicts can be set by separating the keys with double underscores (`__`)."
3. "If an intermediate key doesn't exist, it will be initialized to an empty dict."

## Critical Observations

### What the Documentation Says:
- Keys are processed in sorted (alphabetical) order
- Double underscores create nested dictionary structures
- Intermediate dictionaries are created automatically if they don't exist

### What the Documentation DOESN'T Say:
- The documentation does NOT specify what happens when a key already exists with a non-dict value
- There is NO warning about conflicts between simple keys and nested keys sharing a prefix
- The phrase "If an intermediate key doesn't exist" implies only non-existent keys get dict initialization

## Documentation vs Implementation Gap

The documentation statement "If an intermediate key doesn't exist, it will be initialized to an empty dict" is technically accurate but incomplete. It doesn't address the scenario where:
1. An intermediate key DOES exist
2. But contains a non-dict value
3. And a later nested key needs to traverse through it

## Expected Behavior Based on Documentation

A reasonable user would expect one of these behaviors:
1. The method would handle conflicts gracefully (perhaps by overwriting simple values with dicts when needed)
2. The method would raise a clear error message explaining the conflict
3. The documentation would warn about this limitation

Instead, the current implementation crashes with a cryptic `TypeError`.

## Conclusion

The documentation is incomplete as it doesn't specify the behavior for conflicting key types. However, the current behavior (crashing with TypeError) is clearly not the intended design, as:
1. The sorted order processing is explicitly mentioned, suggesting awareness of ordering issues
2. The automatic dict creation suggests an intent to handle nested structures flexibly
3. A TypeError is a low-level error that indicates implementation oversight, not deliberate design
