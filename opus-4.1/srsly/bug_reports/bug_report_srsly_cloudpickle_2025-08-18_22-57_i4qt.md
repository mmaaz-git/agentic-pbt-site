# Bug Report: srsly.cloudpickle Mutable Closure Side Effect Re-execution

**Target**: `srsly.cloudpickle`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-08-18

## Summary

Functions with mutable closures that contain side effects have those side effects re-executed when the function is called after being pickled and unpickled, violating the round-trip property.

## Property-Based Test

```python
@given(st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=1, max_size=10))
@settings(max_examples=100)
def test_nested_closures_with_mutations(values):
    """Test nested functions with mutable closures"""
    def outer():
        data = list(values)
        
        def middle():
            data.append(99)
            
            def inner():
                return sum(data)
            
            return inner
        
        return middle
    
    func = outer()
    inner_func = func()
    initial_result = inner_func()
    
    restored_func = pickle.loads(cloudpickle.dumps(func))
    restored_inner = restored_func()
    
    assert restored_inner() == initial_result  # This fails!
```

**Failing input**: `values=[0]` (or any list)

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import pickle
import srsly.cloudpickle as cloudpickle

def make_mutating_function():
    data = []
    
    def mutate_and_return():
        data.append(1)
        
        def get_length():
            return len(data)
        
        return get_length
    
    return mutate_and_return

mutating_func = make_mutating_function()
inner_func = mutating_func()
original_length = inner_func()

restored_mutating_func = pickle.loads(cloudpickle.dumps(mutating_func))
restored_inner = restored_mutating_func()
restored_length = restored_inner()

print(f"Original: {original_length}, Restored: {restored_length}")
assert original_length == restored_length, "Bug: closure mutated after unpickling"
```

## Why This Is A Bug

The round-trip property `pickle.loads(cloudpickle.dumps(func))` should produce a function that behaves identically to the original. However, when a function contains side effects that mutate its closure, these side effects are incorrectly re-executed when the restored function is called. This means the restored function's closure state differs from the original's, breaking the fundamental serialization contract.

## Fix

The issue likely stems from how cloudpickle reconstructs functions with closures. When deserializing, the function's code is re-executed, including any side effects. A proper fix would require preserving the closure's state at serialization time and restoring it without re-executing the function body. This is a complex architectural issue that would require careful handling of the function reconstruction process in cloudpickle's internals.
