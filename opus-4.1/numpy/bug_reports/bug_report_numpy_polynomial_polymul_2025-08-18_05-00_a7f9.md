# Bug Report: numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polymul Violates Associativity with Shape Inconsistency

**Target**: `numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polymul`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-08-18

## Summary

`polymul` produces inconsistent output shapes when multiplying polynomials with very small coefficients, causing associativity to fail with a shape mismatch error.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
import numpy.polynomial.polynomial as poly
import numpy as np

safe_floats = st.floats(allow_nan=False, allow_infinity=False, min_value=-1e6, max_value=1e6)
polynomial_coeffs = st.lists(safe_floats, min_size=1, max_size=10)

@given(polynomial_coeffs, polynomial_coeffs, polynomial_coeffs)
def test_polymul_associative(c1, c2, c3):
    """Multiplication should be associative: (c1 * c2) * c3 = c1 * (c2 * c3)"""
    c1 = c1[:4]
    c2 = c2[:4]
    c3 = c3[:4]
    
    result1 = poly.polymul(poly.polymul(c1, c2), c3)
    result2 = poly.polymul(c1, poly.polymul(c2, c3))
    assert np.allclose(result1, result2, rtol=1e-8, atol=1e-8)
```

**Failing input**: `c1=[6051.0], c2=[0.0, 2.0605381455397936e-53], c3=[1.0, 1.9814762013259695e-275]`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
import numpy.polynomial.polynomial as poly
import numpy as np

c1 = [6051.0]
c2 = [0.0, 2.0605381455397936e-53]
c3 = [1.0, 1.9814762013259695e-275]

result1 = poly.polymul(poly.polymul(c1, c2), c3)
result2 = poly.polymul(c1, poly.polymul(c2, c3))

print(f"(c1 * c2) * c3 shape: {result1.shape}, values: {result1}")
print(f"c1 * (c2 * c3) shape: {result2.shape}, values: {result2}")
print(f"Shapes match: {result1.shape == result2.shape}")

try:
    np.allclose(result1, result2)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"np.allclose fails: {e}")
```

## Why This Is A Bug

Mathematical associativity requires that (a × b) × c = a × (b × c) for all valid inputs. While the numerical values may differ slightly due to floating-point arithmetic, the result arrays should at least have compatible shapes. The function produces arrays of different lengths depending on the order of operations when dealing with coefficients near machine epsilon, violating this fundamental algebraic property.

## Fix

The issue stems from inconsistent handling of near-zero trailing coefficients in the multiplication result. The fix requires consistent trimming of negligible coefficients:
