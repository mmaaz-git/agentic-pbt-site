  "result": "Perfect! I've successfully found and documented two genuine bugs in the `dateutil` library through property-based testing:\n\n1. **relativedelta inverse property violation** (Medium severity) - Adding and subtracting the same relativedelta doesn't always return to the original date when mixing month and day arithmetic.\n\n2. **Easter date range violation** (High severity) - The Easter calculation returns dates outside the valid range (May instead of March/April) and on wrong weekdays (Friday instead of Sunday) for certain years.\n\nBoth bugs were discovered by testing fundamental mathematical properties and invariants that should always hold. The property-based testing approach with Hypothesis was effective at finding edge cases that violate expected behavior.",
