The only genuine bugs I found are the pickling issues, which are significant for multiprocessing and distributed systems. \n\n## Summary\n\nI tested the `urllib.error` module with property-based testing and found **one significant bug affecting all three exception classes**: they do not properly support pickling, which is expected for Python exceptions.\n\n**Bug found**: All three exception classes (`URLError`, `HTTPError`, `ContentTooShortError`) fail to properly pickle/unpickle:\n- `URLError` loses its `filename` attribute when pickled\n- `HTTPError` cannot be unpickled at all\n- `ContentTooShortError` cannot be unpickled at all\n\nI've created a comprehensive bug report with reproduction code and a proposed fix. The bug is categorized as **Medium severity** and **Logic type**, as it affects the correct behavior of these exceptions in multiprocessing and distributed contexts.",
