# Bug Report: click.core.batch Loses Elements When Batch Size Exceeds Input Length

**Target**: `click.core.batch`
**Severity**: High
**Bug Type**: Logic
**Date**: 2025-08-18

## Summary

The `batch` function in click.core silently loses elements when the input has fewer elements than the batch size or when there are leftover elements that don't form a complete batch.

## Property-Based Test

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from click.core import batch

@given(
    st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=0, max_size=100),
    st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=20)
)
def test_batch_preserves_elements(items, batch_size):
    """All elements from input should appear in batched output"""
    batched = batch(items, batch_size)
    flattened = [item for batch_tuple in batched for item in batch_tuple]
    
    # Property: All original elements should be present
    assert sorted(items) == sorted(flattened)
```

**Failing input**: `items=[0], batch_size=2`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from click.core import batch

# Case 1: Input smaller than batch_size - all elements lost
items = [1, 2, 3]
result = batch(items, 5)
print(f"Input: {items}, Output: {result}")
# Output: Input: [1, 2, 3], Output: []

# Case 2: Leftover elements - last element lost
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = batch(items, 2)
flattened = [x for b in result for x in b]
print(f"Input: {items}, Flattened output: {flattened}")
# Output: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Flattened output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Why This Is A Bug

The `batch` function is expected to group elements into batches without losing any data. This violates the fundamental invariant that all input elements should be preserved in the output. The function is used internally by Click when processing environment variables for options with `multiple=True` and `nargs > 1`, potentially causing silent data loss in CLI applications.

## Fix

```diff
def batch(iterable: cabc.Iterable[V], batch_size: int) -> list[tuple[V, ...]]:
-    return list(zip(*repeat(iter(iterable), batch_size), strict=False))
+    import itertools
+    it = iter(iterable)
+    result = []
+    while True:
+        batch_tuple = tuple(itertools.islice(it, batch_size))
+        if not batch_tuple:
+            break
+        result.append(batch_tuple)
+    return result
```
