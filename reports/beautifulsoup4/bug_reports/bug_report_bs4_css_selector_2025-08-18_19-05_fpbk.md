# Bug Report: BeautifulSoup CSS Selector Crashes on Malformed Tag Names

**Target**: `bs4.BeautifulSoup.select`
**Severity**: Medium
**Bug Type**: Crash
**Date**: 2025-08-18

## Summary

BeautifulSoup's CSS selector method crashes when selecting tags with special characters in their names, while find_all() handles these same tags correctly.

## Property-Based Test

```python
@given(nested_html())
@settings(max_examples=200)
def test_find_all_vs_select_for_tags(html):
    """Test that find_all and CSS select return same count for simple tag selectors."""
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    
    all_tags = soup.find_all()
    tag_names_in_soup = list(set(tag.name for tag in all_tags))
    
    for tag_name in tag_names_in_soup:
        find_all_count = len(soup.find_all(tag_name))
        select_count = len(soup.select(tag_name))
        assert find_all_count == select_count
```

**Failing input**: `html='<div><div><A</div></div>'`

## Reproducing the Bug

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html = '<a<>test</a<>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

print('Tag name:', soup.find().name)

# This works fine
result = soup.find_all('a<')
print(f'find_all found {len(result)} tags')

# This crashes
result = soup.select('a<')
```

## Why This Is A Bug

BeautifulSoup is designed to handle malformed HTML gracefully. When it parses HTML with invalid tag names like `<a<>`, it creates a tag with name `a<`. The `find_all()` method correctly handles searching for these malformed tags, but the CSS `select()` method crashes with a SelectorSyntaxError. This inconsistency violates the expectation that both search methods should handle the same set of tags that BeautifulSoup can parse.

## Fix

The issue is in the CSS selector parser which doesn't handle special characters in tag names. A fix would need to either:
1. Escape special characters in tag names before passing to the CSS selector parser
2. Make the CSS selector skip/ignore tags with invalid names rather than crashing
3. Normalize tag names during parsing to prevent special characters

The fix would likely be in the `select` method to sanitize tag names before passing them to soupsieve.
