  "result": "## Bug Found! \ud83d\udc1b\n\nI successfully discovered a **list property mutation vulnerability** in `troposphere.securitylake`. \n\n### The Bug\nThe `AwsLogSource` class (and likely other classes in the module) stores direct references to mutable list arguments instead of creating defensive copies. This allows external code to modify the object's internal state after creation.\n\n### Impact\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Logic bug (encapsulation violation)\n- External mutations to lists can unexpectedly change CloudFormation resource definitions\n- Could lead to hard-to-track bugs and potential security issues\n\n### Bug Report\nCreated: `bug_report_troposphere_securitylake_2025-08-19_02-31_4hlk.md`\n\nThe bug was discovered through property-based testing that verified whether list properties are safely isolated from external mutations. The test revealed that modifying the original list after passing it to the constructor affects the internal state of the AWS resource object.",
